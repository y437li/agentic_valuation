Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Equity Residential First Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, May 1, 2014. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Please go ahead. Marty McKenna : Thanks, Camille. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's first quarter results. Our featured speakers today are David Neithercut, our President and CEO; and David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer. Mark Parrell, our CFO, is also here with us for the Q&A. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. And now I'll turn it over to David Neithercut. David J. Neithercut: Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We're extremely pleased to have delivered normalized FFO for the first quarter of $0.71 a share, and that's an amount that's near the high end of our previously provided guidance range, and one that represents an increase of nearly 11% over the first quarter of last year. For the first quarter of '14, our same-store revenue, which includes nearly 18,500 Archstone units, grew 4% over the first quarter of last year, which was slightly better than our original expectations. And it is no surprise that San Francisco, Denver and Seattle continue to lead the way, with Washington, D.C., bringing up the rear by a very wide margin. Fundamentals in the business remain favorable. David Santee will go into more specific market-level detail in just a moment. But from a portfolio-wide perspective, current occupancy is 95.9%. And through the first 4 months of the year, we've achieved average renewal increases in excess of 5%, a level we expect to achieve in the coming months as well. So we're confident that we are well positioned as we approach our primary leasing season, and I can assure you that our teams across the country are eager and very well prepared to maximize revenue during this very important time of the year. So now I'll turn the call over to David, who will take you through what we're seeing across our specific markets today and how things are setting up for the summer leasing season. David S. Santee: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll round out our Q1 performance results with a brief recap of our key drivers of revenue growth, provide some color on our expenses and how that plays out for the balance of the year, and then give you current pricing, renewal rates for April and May, coupled with some brief commentary across the core markets. Now in addition to the renewal and occupancy results David gave you in his opening remarks, turnover for the quarter continued its decline with an 80 basis point reduction from Q1 of '13, translating into a 300 basis point decline on a year-to-date annualized basis. While managing lease expirations is a never-ending but critical process, the percentage of residents electing to renew with us is at the highest level we have seen in the 7 years we have been tracking this metric. Also fueling the lower turnover is less home buying. Move-outs for home purchases decreased 30 basis points, to 11.9% of move-outs. But more telling is the absolute number of residents buying homes, declining in 9 out of 10 of our core markets, the lowest we have seen in the last 5 quarters. Net effective new lease base rents for the quarter averaged above 3% through March, and have averaged slightly above 4.5% April-over-April. While a much stronger start to the leasing season than last year, improving rates are simply reacting to the normal season patterns that occur every year. Also contributing to our favorable revenue growth for the quarter is the ancillary income growth in the Archstone portfolio. Plugging these assets into our platform allows us the visibility to fully realize the benefits of our centralized and subject-matter expert approach to day-to-day property management activity. Simple things like late charges, which were up 50%; pet rent, up 250%; transfer fees, up 220% all add up to being very accretive to our total income growth. As we say internally, the next big thing at Equity Residential is doing many small things extremely well, if not perfect. As we look out over the next 90 days, our exposure is dead on to same week 1 year ago. Renewal offers have been issued above 7% through July and achieved renewal results for April and May are on the books at 5.3%, with net effective new lease rents approaching 5% year-over-year. With all these indicators flashing green, we remain extremely optimistic, but mindful, of the magnitude of new deliveries across all of our markets, and that the full year revenue growth targets are achieved over the next 90 days. Expenses for the quarter came in on the high end of our expectations, due to utilities and real estate taxes. As we have discussed previously, real estate taxes, payroll and utilities make up 68% of total operating costs. So by now, it's no surprise that utility costs had a significant impact across all types of businesses as a result of the extreme temperatures. More telling are the significant price spikes that occurred in the deregulated electricity markets in the Northeast, with unprecedented increases of 300% to 400% across all of the regional pricing indexes. Consumption of energy in the EQR portfolio was up a modest 5% to 7%, as we continually to -- as we continue to aggressively invest in LED lighting, solar and cogeneration opportunities that provide outstanding rates of return on investment. More recently, with global forces having tremendous influence on energy costs here at home, vigilance will be necessary to keep these costs in check going forward. Additionally, since our initial guidance in February, we have revised real estate taxes upward to 6.2% from 5.2%, both for the full year, as a result of Washington, D.C. valuations increasing more than expected and higher-than-expected taxes in King County, Seattle, Washington. Now mitigating these costs are the operational efficiencies realized through the addition of the Archstone portfolio to full year same-store. Comparing Q1 '14 costs on the EQR platform versus Q1 2013 costs on the Archstone platform allowed us to reduce total costs in leasing and advertising, which were down 23%; turnover cost, down 19%; property management cost, down 2.3%; and most importantly, making up 20% of our total expense, on-site payroll, which was down 4%. So excluding real estate taxes and utilities, our controllable operating expenses declined 2.1% for the quarter. While we expect these expense levels on the Archstone portfolio to continue to offset legacy portfolio growth rates, the impact will diminish over the course of the year, primarily in the next 2 quarters. Archstone Payroll, as an example, was not fully optimized until mid-Q3 of '13. For modeling purposes, we would not expect any material expense mitigation beyond Q3 and the mitigation in Q2 to be less favorable than Q1. Now moving on to the markets. I'll provide you with our occupancy today. April and May achieved renewal rates and then net effective new lease base rents 4 weeks out. For California, I'll only quote April renewals, as these are 30-day markets and May has yet to firm. As David said, we continue to maintain our 3 buckets of performance across the portfolio. In our top-performing bucket we have San Francisco, Denver and Seattle, with expected full year revenue growth well above 5.5%. The bottom bucket remains Washington, D.C., down 1%. And all other markets, making up the middle bucket, with expected full year revenue growth of 3.5% to 5%. Seattle continues to be a great job producer and systematically absorbed the expected 7,500 deliveries without material disruption to the market. With occupancy at 96% and exposure on top of same week last year, renewal rates achieved for April and May are gaining momentum at 8.3% and 9%, respectively. Net effective base rents 30 days out are up 6% to 7% versus same period last year, with impressive strength in the CBD and Belltown, Queen Anne submarkets. San Francisco continues to be our top market for yet another year, with the Peninsula and South Bay leading the way in year-over-year revenue growth, while North San Jose continues to absorb units at a reasonable pace. After a slow start to the year, occupancy is now 96.3%, and renewal rates achieved remain strong at 8.8% for April, with net effective base rents up 8% to 9%. Denver, despite delivering almost 10,000 units this year, remains resilient with a bustling energy and tech-driven economy, and is producing some of the best job growth numbers in percentage terms in the nation. With concentrated deliveries in the urban core and our portfolio concentrated in the South and Southwest, we would expect another banner year from Denver, with occupancy today at 96.6%. Renewal rates achieved remain very solid at 8.3% and 8.5%, with net effective base rents above 7%. So jumping down to Los Angeles. Results, thus far, while solid, unfortunately do not paint the picture of the breakout year that many had hoped. L.A. continues its slow and steady improvement in fundamentals, with occupancy at 95.4%, although employment remains stubbornly high at 8.7%. Nevertheless, renewals achieved are solid for April at 6.1%. Net effective base rents are up 5.8%, again this is versus same week last year, and are poised have a good run over the next 3 months, based on our historical seasonal pattern. Orange County, after dealing with a constant stream of elevated concessions in Q1, primarily from the overhang of delayed deliveries, has now returned to good health. Occupancy today is 95.9% and achieved renewal rates improved to 4.9%, with net effective base rents up 6%. Our outlook for Orange County is a bit brighter than that of L.A. San Diego, good news. The ship is still in, with occupancy strong at 96.7%. Renewal growth rates are some of the highest we've seen in years, at 5.2% for April. Net effective base rents are steady, up 6% over same week last year. With 5,000 new units sprinkled throughout the market, we would expect smooth sailing through the balance of the year. So jumping over to Boston. The urban core deliveries have arrived, and are in full lease-up mode. Across the street and down the block, we continue to see favorable demand in our downtown submarkets and steady absorption of quality assets, with only minus price -- modest price negotiations on renewals, at 96.8% occupancy, and renewals achieved having remained solid at 4.1% and 4.3%. Net effective base rents remain strong, up 4.5%, versus same week last year. Now New York fared better with occupancy in the quarter. However, the pause button remained in the on position relative to net effective base rent growth, which remained at or below 2% for much of the quarter. Job growth remains solid, but many are on the low end of the pay scale, with fewer in the higher-paying financial services sector. Today, the portfolio is 96% occupied, with achieved renewal rates of 4.7% for both April and May. Net effective base rents were up 4%, versus same week last year. So the next 2 months should set the table for full year revenue growth. Jumping down to South Florida, and saving Washington for last. South Florida remains a steady performer with occupancy at 95.8%, about the same position they were last year. Achieved renewals of 5.7% and 5.8% for April and May are very strong, with net effective base rents well above 6%. Given our diversified 3-county portfolio, we would not expect, nor are we seeing, any impact from the expected 7,200 new deliveries this year on top of the 6,000 units delivered in '13. And last but not least is Washington, D.C. Occupancy pressures are starting to mount as our portfolio occupancy sits at 95% today, roughly 30 to 40 basis points less versus year-to-date last year. Looking at our dashboard, there still appears to be a healthy level of demand across the MSA. Net effective base rents continue to fluctuate between flat and minus 2%, as the various submarkets react to the deliveries. Achieved renewal rates are still holding at 2.6% and 3.3% for April and May. And our experience during the last downturn leads us to believe we can continue to mitigate the effective lower new lease rents with more favorable positive renewal growth. Jobs will continue to be the governor on how this all plays out for 2016. Today, though, interestingly, aside from PG County, Maryland, the District and the Rosslyn-Ballston submarkets are performing the best, making up 41% of our portfolio. Both have the least negative year-to-date revenue decline, with current month revenue growth improving versus Alexandria and South Arlington submarkets, which are further out and declining, a potential signal that many are taking advantage of moving closer in while rental rates become more attractive. So all in all, everything appears to be on track as we enter the peak leasing season. Seattle takes first place for the unexpected upside surprise, while New York City brings us back to even. We know there are major delivery hurdles out there, but to date, the markets are absorbing these units with little dislocation or concessions. We have our platform tuned up. We have some of the best and brightest in our industry across many disciplines, and we're all anxious to deliver our 2014 goals. David J. Neithercut: Terrific. Thank you, David. Just a little bit now on transaction and development before we open the call to questions. For the first time in nearly a year, we acquired a one-off asset in the first quarter '14 in Los Angeles, where we bought a 430-unit project built in 2008 near LAX. The deal was acquired for $143 million at a cap rate of 4.9%. You'll recall that we exceeded our original disposition guidance in 2013, when we opportunistically sold a 1,400-unit asset in San Diego late in the year for $366 million and a cap rate in the mid-5s. Now in addition to lower annual sales volumes going forward, that sale and this acquisition are examples of the type of transaction activity you should expect from us. The sale of older, surface-parked properties in our core markets, but more suburban in nature, with proceeds reinvested in higher-density, more urban assets at a much narrower cap rate spread than it's been [ph] in recent years, in this case, about 70 basis points. The development team continues to be extremely busy with an elevated level of activity, thanks to our legacy land inventory and the Archstone land sites that we acquired in 2013. During the first quarter of this year, we completed construction in 5 projects, 1,290 units, with a total development cost of $370 million. Now we expect to achieve yields from 6% to 7% on current market rents, inclusive of management costs, on those transactions. During the first quarter, we also started 3 new projects, 1,145 units and a total project cost of $614 million, and we project yields of mid-4 to mid-5 on current market rents on those starts. So with the starts in the first quarter, that leaves us today with 9 land sites in inventory that we expect to develop soon, representing a pipeline of just over 2,500 units in terrific urban locations in our core markets, with a development cost of approximately $1.1 billion. And of this current inventory, we expect to begin construction on several hundred million more yet this year with the balance to begin in 2015. And with that, Camille, we'll be happy to open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of David Toti with Cantor. David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : I just have 2 questions. First, sort of stepping back in terms of operations. The quarter saw slightly higher occupancy and lower turn, which to me seems a little bit counterintuitive in this part of the cycle. Is that characteristic of sort your first quarter dynamics in your opinion? Or was that intentional -- intentionally somewhat defensive? David S. Santee: I think we're managing lease expirations. We're being intentional in trying to mitigate the volatility that we see in Q4 and Q1. So I mean, like I said, one of the biggest benefits is just significantly fewer homebuyers, and then just a tendency for people to stay put. David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : And do you find this, in general, kind of surprising at this point in the cycle? David S. Santee: No, I think we -- I don't find the home buying surprising. We saw turnover drop pretty dramatically in Q4, and we had hoped that would continue through Q1, and it did. David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then my other question just has to do with the acquisition, the $143 million. Can you give us maybe some detail on the underwriting that made that price attractive in terms of your expectations for occupancy perhaps or rent growth? Or is there material synergies in terms of operating savings? What's the driver of that being a good fit at a 4.9% cap? David J. Neithercut: Well, I guess we identified this asset in a higher density kind of urban location. We think we bought at a favorable price. I'm not sure the deal was heavily marketed. And we were able to just plug it into our platform there in L.A. and run it very efficiently. As I say, we bought it at about a 4.9% cap. We think that year 2 could be in the mid-5s. And it's just a nice complement to our existing portfolio. David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : Do you think it'll top out in the mid-5s? Or do you see more upside in sort of a 2- or 3-year window? David J. Neithercut: Well, I don't think rents are you going flat, if that's the question. I mean David commented about L.A. We think Southern California is beginning to show improvement, and we think it'll be a very solid, long-term deal, and it'll be very strong, high-single-digit IRR for us. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Recognizing that Archstone is now in the same-store portfolio. But could you give a breakdown of how same-store revenue growth differed between the EQR legacy portfolio and the Archstone portfolio? David S. Santee: So I think the best way to say this is that the Archstone portfolio is performing as we expected relative to our underwriting in the various submarkets. So head to head, when we have a couple of Archstone properties in Chelsea and we have our legacy properties in Chelsea, those properties perform very similar. When you start looking at market dynamics, there are anomalies that kind of create some differences, but we know what those are. So head to head, they perform as expected and very similar. Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : And then you quote the 5% average renewal increase. How does that compare to where the renewals were actually sent out? David S. Santee: So historically, our spread has always been in the neighborhood of 180 to 200 basis points. And that's where it stands today. Some markets are a little tighter. But rarely do markets exceed 200 basis points. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : David, it's Michael Bilerman. I just had a quick question. In your opening comments, you talked about transfer fees being up, I don't know, something like 200%, and you talked about the retention and that people are staying in place, so it was the highest rate in 7 years. And I'm curious, when you step back from that, how much of it do you think is just the new EQR portfolio, that more people sort of like the places that you offer? How much of it's the services and the customer things that you're doing? How much of it's maybe not charging high-enough rents to the tenants? And how much it maybe was just weather-related where no one wanted to move and were willing to pay whatever it was to not schlep their stuff around? David S. Santee: Well -- gosh, there's a lot of questions there. Let me deal with revenue first. I think if you remember a few years back, we set up this business group and we've taken a lot of, if you want to call it, authority or some of the decision making. At the property level, we simply automated a lot of that. So no longer can -- do we leave it up to property managers to charge late fees or settlement fees or -- all of these fees and additional charges are built into our platform and automatically billed. And then, if they want to waive that, then they -- there's a process and the support group that helps them with that. But when we set this up on our legacy portfolio, I think 3 or 4 years ago, we saw the same thing, 50%, 60% increases in late fees. It's just the same. It's just we're seeing the same thing that happened to the legacy portfolio when we implemented those types of activities on these ancillary income items. So what was the -- what was your next question? Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Well, I'm just trying to figure out. I mean, you have -- you said there was higher transfer fees that you got as people transferred in the equity res portfolio, and there was a much higher retention rate of people staying and renewing. And I think you said it was the highest in 7 years. And what I just wanted to try to figure out is, is that a sign of the portfolio that you have? Or is it a sign that maybe you're not pushing rents enough? Or was it just happening in the first quarter where a lot of people just didn't want to move and were willing to accept whatever rent they got? It was -- I was trying to put those 2 things together. David S. Santee: Yes, I guess I would say, it's probably a bit of all of that. But I would tell you that when we look -- let's talk about the renewals, the percent of residents renewing. We see that across almost all of our markets. It's not just a Archstone-related thing or a new portfolio. I mean, Seattle, we added 3 Archstone properties, virtually 0 impact on our overall staff. So I think there was some of that. On the other side of lower turnover, in raw terms, let's talk -- it was about 700 move-outs for the quarter. Consequently, we had 700 less move-ins than we had last year. So it becomes a little murky because when you get up to 96% occupancy, you start having availability issues. But could the weather have played a role in that? Certainly, it could've. But I don't know how we would measure that. David J. Neithercut: And Michael, it's David Neithercut. Just to make one clarification here. The increase in the fees really came from the Archstone portfolio, where a lot of -- in which we collected more in the first quarter under our ownership than they had collected in the first quarter under their ownership. So I just want to make sure it was clear that these -- it wasn't kind of -- increased fees across the board, but rather a significant increase in those collected as a result of plugging their assets onto our platform. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors. David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : David Santee, at the beginning of the year or on the fourth quarter call, you laid out your revenue growth guidance, and you've appended [ph] it with your assumptions for base rent growth, renewal rent growth and occupancy. And through the first 4 months of the year, it appears as though you're tracking well ahead on all 3 of those metrics. Is -- are we correct in that interpretation? And is that steering you towards the top half of your growth guidance for the year? David S. Santee: I feel good that we would be in the top half of the guidance, just as I would expenses. David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And another question relates to your March investor presentation. I think you talked about this on the fourth quarter call as well. Equity Residential has put out a view that apartment completions in your core markets will be significantly lower in 2015 than 2014. And you must have a very sophisticated way of looking at this. But we're looking at permits in all of your key markets and on a year-over-year basis, in nearly every market, permits are up still pretty significantly, and that would translate into starts a year from now -- I'm sorry, into completions a year from now. So can you talk about the process that gets you to this much lower level of completions next year versus 2014? David J. Neithercut: Well, I guess that process is the result of the investment professionals and the management professionals we've got in each one of these core markets, that really do bird-dog this process extensively and are aware very specifically of the sites and the activity and what to expect. So that's simply what is being -- permits being pulled. But they have a very good sense as to the real activity that they expect to see happen. So that kind of creates our view of our expectation that deliveries will -- should be down. And also, as we look at, again, what's happening on the demand side and the continued expectation for household formations in these markets gives us the view that things will be back in balance as early as next year. David S. Santee: And then also, Dave, we're talking about deliveries of apartments. And when -- the permit numbers are generally anything 5-plus units. That could include college dorms. It could include senior housing. It could include any type of dwelling that would house 5 or plus more units. But like David said, I mean, we use our BI platform. We update it every quarter. We recently made a 1,500-unit adjustment to deliveries in D.C. next year. So I don't know that there's a one-to-one correlation on permits versus deliveries in '15. David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And just on that point, are you increasingly hearing from your staff on the ground that planned projects are getting shelved? David J. Neithercut: Well, I guess I'm not sure that I'm hearing that specifically, as this process that we went through recently in preparation for this call led us to really no changes from the last time we went through that process. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : It's Ross Nussbaum here with Nick. I've got 2 top-down industry questions for you. The first relates to the bill that's making its way through the Senate banking committee that would, I guess, preserve the liquidity that Fannie and Freddie are providing to the multi-family housing business. And curious what your take on that is and the success of that actually moving through the pipe. David S. Santee: Well, I guess I'll let the Vice Chair of the NMHC Finance Committee answer that question. David J. Neithercut: I don't think that comes with any compensation, so I won't honor it. To answer the question, Ross, we think that bill is very favorable. This is the bill that's now being considered by the banking committee, the multi-family. We think it preserves many of the best aspects of the existing system and will provide a great deal of liquidity in good times and bad for the sector. In terms of probabilities, what we're sort of hearing is that it's increasingly less likely that anything will happen this next month or so. And if that's the case, then with the election, in a lot of respects, right around the corner, that means nothing will happen in this Congress, and it'll all be deferred. So our best guess is that nothing will occur. But certainly, that's subject to change. And they're working on the markup, as we understand it, right now. So certainly subject to change. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay, appreciate that. Second question, on the homeownership rate. I'm sure you knew that Sam was speaking earlier this week and talked about the rate, which is at 64.8% now, potentially going down to 55%, which is a pretty bold statement. And I'm curious if you all are in full agreement with your Chairman's view on the home ownership rate and the direction of it. David J. Neithercut: Well, I guess I'll just say that Sam is making more sort of points than making very specific declarations about levels. I -- he believes that there is no reason why the homeownership rate needs to stay back at this historical level of 64%, as a result of just sort of changing demographics and preferences and delayed marriage, et cetera, et cetera. Now whether it's 55 or not, you're absolutely right, that's a very bold statement, and I think he's trying to be provocative. But he certainly is trying to make a point about, that at least for this demographic that rents a significant percentage of our apartments, they are staying with us longer and we expect them to be in the -- rental housing occupants much later, as they do delay marriage, as they enjoy the lifestyle we provide in these high-density urban markets. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And I think Nick had a question. Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Yes, just on New York City. I'm wondering if you've, at all, explored a sale of one asset or more assets to test the condo conversion bid for your portfolio. David J. Neithercut: Look, we like our assets in New York. We think we're very well positioned, and we're certainly keeping an eye on what's happening there. And who knows what it might provoke us to do, but we haven't done anything at this time. Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. And then, I guess, just the one other one on New York is this development right that you added. Can you just remind us, where is that parcel? David J. Neithercut: Well, it's by the Lincoln Tunnel. And those rights were against an easement, and there was a subdivision of a neighboring parcel, which gave us some more rights. But that's a property we own near the Lincoln Tunnel. Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. And then that -- what -- I mean, how soon might that be a start that would be possible? David J. Neithercut: It will be some time before that's a start. That is not one of the transactions that's included in our expectations for '14 and '15. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ryan Bennett with Zelman & Associates. Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Most of my questions have been answered, but just one point of clarification on the quarter. David Santee, I think you mentioned utility -- had brought up utilities being up significantly year-over-year. Just in terms of the impact on your revenue, given your recoveries on utilities, was there a material impact this quarter and how did that compare to the first quarter of last year? Mark J. Parrell: It's Mark Parrell, just answering the question. But just a little bit of context on utilities for us and the RUBS income, which is the sort of contra to that -- which is the number in our revenue. 75% of the RUBS income we have is water, sewer and trash, which does have energy-related components, but it's not a direct kind of item that's hit by an energy cost change. So what we did, as David Santee mentioned, when we plugged all these new acquisition properties into our system, was also to plug it into our RUB system. So sequentially, the 0.5% revenue increase we reported was unchanged of RUBS. So if you had taken RUBS out, you still would have had 0.5%. Quarter-over-quarter, it was a 19 basis point improvement, so benefit to our numbers. And again, that's because of this, I think, permanent plugging in of these acquisition assets into our system and better utilization of it and better acceptance by residents of these charges being part of their responsibility. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America. Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Just a quick question on Boston. It seems that you benefited 120 basis points from year-over-year from nonresidential-related income. Is that the ancillary income you spoke about earlier? And will you continue to see that benefit for the remainder of the year? Mark J. Parrell: That's really -- it's Mark Parrell again. And that's really the garage, Jana. We have a garage near the Boston Garden. And depending on the sort of ups and downs of the Boston sports teams. And also, we did some substantial rehab at that garage that closed it down in part during 2013. So this benefit will exist in Q1 and Q2, and will get smaller through the year. David J. Neithercut: We did reference by footnote in our 2013 statements, Jana, the impact of the garage being down. And we're now just being -- trying to be consistent by showing you exactly what the positive benefit was of the garage, bringing it back online. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : Just some quick questions here. David Santee, I think in your opening comments about New York, where you said the pause was still on, and you commented about lack of financial service growth. Just sort of curious, I mean, any of us looking around the Street can see that -- I don't think -- unless you're compliance, Wall Street's really not hiring. Do you feel that your mix in New York requires financial service or that growth in the TAMI industries are enough to -- those income levels are enough to pay the rents at your portfolio here in the city? David S. Santee: Well, I mean, when we look at our resident makeup, we still have 51% of our New York units occupied by one person. So that goes to more unit makeup, so to speak. Also, when you -- what really doesn't get talked about much is just the level of new development. And there has been a lot, quite a bit, of new development in New York City, all at the very high end of the range. So I think with the -- just the lack of growth in the higher-paying jobs, you have significant deliveries in the luxury Class AAA apartment market. You have other neighborhoods, like Brooklyn, Williamsburg, that were, at one time in the past year, deemed more affordable. Now those rates are approaching New York-type rates. I think there's just been this movement around that's kind of just put a temporary ceiling on rents. So I hope that answers your question. Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : But are you seeing -- so are your folks, when the applicants come in, the people from the ad agencies and social media and all the growth industries, are your leasing people seeing comparable income levels that support where the rents in your portfolio are right now? Or do you think that it may cause a shift in how you allocate capital in the city going forward? David J. Neithercut: Well, I mean, if people are renting these units, they're obviously qualifying with their income. David S. Santee: Yes, and I think it's more -- when you just look at the different neighborhoods in town, I think that's very telling, to some degree. I mean, the Upper West Side has been a little soft for us. But Williamsburg, Brooklyn, those are doing plus 8%, 9% revenue growth. So -- but even in midtown, Upper West Side, we have all different types of quality and price points available, with our Parc Cameron, Parc Coliseum assets. You have Trump. You have 101 West. All those assets have various price points that could really fit or meet the needs of any renter [ph], I think. Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : Okay, great. And then the second question is, on the acquisition disposition guidance, you guys maintained it, but it definitely seems like the disposition market has heated up a lot, whereas the acquisition market is a lot tougher. So your view is -- I mean, obviously, you maintained it, so your view is that you can still keep it. But it would almost seem like we could see you guys end up being net sellers this year, just as the acquisition market is very competitive. Is that a fair view? Or are you comfortable that there are enough off-market deals or what have you that there's still some attractive acquisition opportunities? David J. Neithercut: I guess that remains to be seen. I will tell you that we are beginning to see a reasonable increase in potential activity on the acquisition side. I will tell you that, that seems to be very aggressive in price. So there remains to be seen what activity we'll have in pursuit of some of those opportunities. But the disposition activity will be a function of the kind of reinvestment opportunities that we find. So it's hard for me to answer that question, Alex, except to tell you that we are seeing potentially more assets being offered in the marketplace that we'd be happy to own. It's just a question whether or not pricing makes sense for us relative to the dispositions that we'd incur in order to fund that. Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : Okay. So bottom line is, you're not -- you wouldn't want to sell more and just take advantage of the current strong bid for assets? You want to do really matched transactions? David J. Neithercut: That's correct. We've discussed on multiple calls. Now, really, our acquisition activity will be funded by the disposition activity. And following the $4-plus billion of product that we sold last year, we're not in any hurry, have no immediate need to sell anything. It'll just be a function of the reinvestment opportunity. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Just coming back to the housing market commentary. Just -- we continue to see a slowdown in the overall housing market. And just curious in terms of your outlook, I mean, what level of deceleration sort of was anticipated in the overall housing market? And if it continues to slow, I mean, does that add incremental potential upside for you guys? David J. Neithercut: Well, I guess I'll tell you that our expectations or our planning, our budgeting for any one given year doesn't start with a sort of big macro view on single-family housing. It's really just looking at each individual asset, each individual submarket and what we think is going on in that market. So the fact that fewer people are moving out of our apartments to buy single-family homes really doesn't surprise us much. Nearly 50% of our units are occupied by a single individual. I mean, that's just -- we just don't have in our properties sort of the most common demographic that would be buying single-family homes, that of 2 adults and a child. I mean, that represents about 9% of our units. So I guess, what's really going on in the greater housing market -- and I'll also tell you what's going on in the housing market in Atlanta, in Phoenix, in Las Vegas doesn't really concern us. So as we look at the individual markets in which we've been concentrated and we've been focused, we're not terribly surprised to see the numbers that we're seeing. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets. Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Just to go back to a couple of questions. On dispositions, just to Alex's question, how much is actually being marketed right now? And is it more dependent upon the opportunities coming in? I mean, is there a portfolio that you're marketing that you're just waiting to pull the trigger on right now? Or how should we look at that -- think about that? David J. Neithercut: Well, I guess I'm not quite sure why it matters, Mike. I mean, we do have identified the assets that we would sell. And so in order to make those ready to go we've got brokers' opinions of values. We're prepared. But in terms of actively marketing, there's not a great deal. We don't have a large number of assets that are being actively marketed out there. But we know which ones they would be, and we'd be able to get them to the market very quickly if we felt like we needed to or wanted to. Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : But there's no tax situation or anything like that, that would preclude you having you do a 1031 or anything like that? You could sell more if the opportunity arises. David J. Neithercut: No. No, the level of activity we would expect to do, we could be doing without concerns of 1031. Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay, that's more of what I was getting at. Mark, what was -- what's debt pricing right now? And is there still -- is still the bond offering dialed in for the mid part of the year? Mark J. Parrell: Yes. So we really put that, Mike, both in February and now, the bond offering, in the third quarter, just for purposes of your modeling. And we've got something like a 4% rate on that. I think we would do better in the 10-year market by 20 basis points or so than that 4% number. And we also have hedges that have a positive mark that would also lower the rate further. But we're going to be flexible and opportunistic that may occur a little earlier, may occur a little later, it may not be an unsecured offering. So -- but right now, to answer your question about pricing, the secured market is worse, probably by at least 0.125% and probably 0.25%. So again, I think EQR could borrow at 3.80% on a 10-year basis or so in the unsecured market -- or 3.65%, pardon me, and 3.80% in the secured market. So I do think the unsecured market is probably a little more favorable to us at the moment. Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. David Santee, the 3%, isn't that effective rent you quoted, is that a lease-over-lease number, like a blended number in the quarter for the quarter? And if not, what was the actual rent change on leases signed in the first quarter? David S. Santee: Yes, the 3% is really just the net effective base rents that come out of LRO average for the whole portfolio. The actual checkbook number, like every year, tends to be pretty flat because you're renting apartments at the lowest point in the cycle. You have folks breaking leases that rented in the summer. And so when you turn that lease, you're operating at a negative gain to the previous lease amount. So that number, really, for the last 7 years, has always pretty much been 0 to very minimal growth in Q1. Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : So no real change then year-over-year in terms of average... David S. Santee: Yes, no real change. I don't like to quote that number because I just don't think it's representative of the direction that the business is going. It's just a anomaly that occurs in our business cycle. Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Understood. Just helpful just to gauge kind of how it's change -- how that -- how it's changing year-over-year, though. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies & Company. Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Just trying to get a better understanding of the intricacies of Boston. I was hoping maybe you could give us particular submarket information about renewal rates and as well as new rental rates, what those trends look like for particular submarket? David S. Santee: I couldn't give you any specific rates at the submarket level today. But I can tell you that in the financial district, where our 600 Washington community is, you have probably 3 or 4 lease-ups in that immediate area. That's probably the most impactful. When you go over to West End, where we have our large West End, Charles River Park, Emerson over by the Garden, we're doing extremely well. 6%, 5%, 6% revenue growth. Cambridge is doing well. And I think if you take the numbers that I gave you, those are pretty representative of the entire market, other than the financial district where you have a lot of high-end luxury communities coming online pretty much all at the same time putting pressure on the immediate comps. Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : All right, that's very helpful. Then the other thing, just some of the papers coming out in San Francisco about some new tenant protection ordinances in East Palo Alto. Could we just talk about that a little bit and if that has any meaningful impact on your operation? David S. Santee: None whatsoever. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Vahid Khorsand with BWS Financial. Vahid Khorsand - BWS Financial Inc.: Could you provide some insight into how D.C. is tracking compared to what you expected at the beginning of the year and where you think that market is headed for the rest of the year? David J. Neithercut: Which market? David S. Santee: Yes, which... Vahid Khorsand - BWS Financial Inc.: The D.C. market. David S. Santee: D.C? I guess I would say, late last year, I said that D.C., at best, would not go negative until Q2. And would it have not been for a lower occupancy in Q1, we probably would have ended the quarter flat. So other than being lower occupied, rates did exactly what they thought, and we just achieved -- arrived at minus 50 basis points about 2 months earlier than expected. Vahid Khorsand - BWS Financial Inc.: Okay. And how do you think that's going to track for the rest of the year? Is it going to continue down the same path with lower occupancy than expected? Or will there be a swing upwards? David S. Santee: Well, like I said in my comments, when we look at our -- when we look at the markets, there's varying degrees of levels of deliveries in some of the submarkets, the R-B, Rosslyn-Ballston corridor has seen a lot of deliveries in the last couple of years. They will continue to have deliveries. But yet, on a year-over-year revenue basis, revenue growth basis, that market is doing better than we expected. Alexandria, South Arlington, the further you get away from downtown D.C., it seems to be more problematic, but you also have equal amounts of new product coming online there as well. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. David J. Neithercut: Well, thank you, all, very much for your time and attention today. We look forward to seeing many of you at the NAREIT meeting next month. Thanks so much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does concludes our conference call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division Operator : Well, good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Equity Residential 2Q '14 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Please go ahead, sir. Marty McKenna : Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's Second Quarter 2014 Results. Our featured speakers today are : David Neithercut, our President and CEO; David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Parrell, our Chief Financial Officer. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the [indiscernible] law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. And now I'll turn it over to David Neithercut. David J. Neithercut: Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. And on our last call, I told you that the EQR teams across the country had our properties very well positioned for the upcoming leasing season and that they were raring to go to maximize revenue during this very important time of the year. Well, here we are at the end of July, with a couple months of the leasing season in the bank, with August squarely in our sights, and I'm once again pleased to say that our teams have delivered on their promise. As we announced last night, same-store revenues increased 4% for the first half of the year and 4.1% in the second quarter. As a result, we've increased our full year same-store revenue guidance to a midpoint of 4%, which is at the high end of our original guidance provided in early February. And we have also increased our normalized FFO guidance for the full year to a midpoint of $3.10 a share, nearly 9% higher than last year and an annual increase that is among the largest we've experienced in the last 15 years. And this is all because the fundamentals remain very, very solid with continued strong demand for quality rental housing like that provided by Equity Residential. We're also pleased that the continued strength in fundamentals is being experienced across nearly every one of our core markets. Reaching the high end of our original same-store revenue guidance range is not due to any particular market or markets performing significantly better than what we'd expected, but rather nearly every market performing above our baseline expectations and more towards our best-case expectations. Across nearly every market, our occupancy is closer to best case, our retention is closer to best case and market rents and renewal rents are both better than we had expected, even in those markets where there was some concern about new supply. So we're very pleased about our performance so far this year and how things are shaping up for the entire year. And with that, I'll let David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer, discuss in more detail what we're currently seeing in each of our core markets and how we performed during this all-important leasing season. And he'll be followed by Mark Parrell, our Chief Financial Officer, who will address our updated guidance and capital-raising activities. David S. Santee: Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Well, it continues to be a great time to be in the apartment business as evidenced by our strong revenue performance in the quarter and first half of the year across our entire portfolio. In general, new deliveries that are coming to market are being leased up faster than expected while maintaining order and price discipline, with concessions at stabilized assets almost nonexistent. Continued improvement in job growth, consumer sentiment and added lift, both revenue and expenses, from the inclusion of the Archstone portfolio [Audio Gap] guidance for the year. Today, I'll provide color on our 4 key revenue drivers, briefly discuss our expense drivers, and then update you on each of our core markets. To date, all 4 of our key performance indicators are stronger than expected. Net effective base rents have consistently exceeded our original expectations by almost 50 basis points and are currently 4.7% above same week last year. Renewal increases, originally expected to moderate slightly below 5%, have consistently exceeded 5% and accelerated from 5.4% in Q1 to 5.5% in Q2. With a 5.9% achieved on the books for July and August currently at 5.5%, which we know that will improve throughout the month, we should exceed our full year renewal growth expectations by 60 to 75 basis points. Turnover for the quarter declined again from 14.4% in 2013 to 14.2%. If you recall, in the previous quarters we discussed our lease expiration management and moving more leases from Q4 and Q1 into Q2. So seeing a decline in both percentage and absolute terms in Q2 is even more meaningful as residents are less inclined to move from quality buildings and neighborhoods that shape their lifestyle. With July stats on the books and notice to vacates given through August and September, it appears that turnover will continue to decline, driven largely by fewer move-outs to buy homes. In fact, move-outs to buy homes declined over flat quarter-over-quarter across all of our major markets with San Francisco being the only exception, which had 3 more move-outs to buy homes. Occupancy improved 20 basis points for the quarter to 95.8%, which puts us right on top of our full year guidance of 95.5%. Expenses for the quarter were up 1.4%, allowing us to make up some ground after the brutal utility expense for Q1. Excluding real estate taxes, all other expenses declined 1.05%, driven by our expected savings from the inclusion of the Archstone portfolio and a more efficient property management operation. As a result of staffing and process optimizations across the Archstone portfolio, on-site payroll costs for those assets were down 3.2% for the quarter and 10.2% year-to-date. In the maintenance category, again just for the Archstone communities, turn costs were down 32% for the quarter and 40% year-to-date as a result of implementing our turnover philosophy, which emphasizes the use of in-house labor versus contract services. Additionally, the close proximity of both Archstone and legacy assets have allowed us to optimize our Internet spend and reduce L&A cost across the combined portfolio by almost 20% for the quarter and 17.5% year-to-date. As we discussed previously, the favorable contribution to same-store expense reduction for the Archstone assets will diminish as we move further into the year and begin to realize stabilized comp periods. Real estate taxes, which account for 35% of total expense, remain unchanged at a 6.2% full year growth rate. And we are confident that this number is a worst-case scenario, allowing us to tighten the total expense growth range between 2.25% and 2.75%. And moving on to our markets. We continue to maintain our 3 buckets of revenue performance, with the top bucket consisting of Seattle, San Francisco and Denver producing revenue growth in excess of 5%. The middle bucket of 3% to 5% revenue growth includes all other markets, excluding D.C. which is in a bucket by itself, with a projected revenue decline of 1% for the full year. So starting in the Northwest, Seattle continues its outsized performance with robust job growth and a per capita income 23% higher than the national average. Boeing, Amazon and Microsoft continue to provide a solid economic foundation. Our 2 lease-ups are above pro forma rent and well ahead on occupancy. 320 Pine, a 134-unit presale acquisition, went from 0% occupancy in February to 99% occupancy in June. Our Central Business District Bellevue and Redmond submarkets lead the way with plus 7% revenue growth year-to-date. There are marginal differences when looking at other in-town submarkets versus the suburbs, as all submarkets are producing average year-to-date revenue growth of 6.5%. While the recent Microsoft layoffs were troubling at first, the direct impact of the announced local reductions should have little impact in the Redmond submarket. With new deliveries in Redmond already leased and only 350 being delivered in 2015, Redmond should do just fine barring any further negative news. Denver continues the outperformance despite delivering almost 10,000 units. With a high concentration of new deliveries downtown, growth in our CBD submarket is a meager 4.3%, while our well-diversified suburban submarkets range from 7% to plus 9% year-to-date. San Francisco continues to be the lead market for the fourth consecutive year. Net effective new lease rents and renewals achieved continued to be in the 9% to 11% range, and we see no signs of a slowdown. Even with elevated deliveries, the level of supply is simply not sufficient to meet demand from the continued tech boom. The Peninsula submarket continues to produce the highest revenue growth, followed by our downtown portfolio. However, the East Bay appears to be accelerating as renters look for more affordable housing. Los Angeles continues to perform well and as expected. Despite new deliveries being concentrated in the downtown and Mid-Wilshire corridor submarkets, these 2 areas are accelerating and producing the largest revenue growth of our 8 L.A. submarkets, with 5.5% and 5.4% year-to-date, respectively. Our weakest growth is coming from Santa Clarita and West L.A, primarily in and around the Marina del Rey area. With such a diverse and improving economy, we would expect L.A. to continue its positive momentum with above-trend growth for an extended period of time. Orange County continues to produce accelerating growth as a result of few deliveries and well-diversified job gains. Move-outs to buy homes have declined in Orange County more than any other market, about 400 basis points. And it appears that both future supply and expected job growth are perfectly in sync over the next several years. San Diego, with 3,000 deliveries, is realizing price pressure downtown, our lowest revenue growth submarket. The I-5 and the I-15 corridor submarkets continue to do well as minimal supply and decent job growth provide a stable operating environment. Moving over to the East Coast. Boston, like Denver, is feeling the effects of a concentration of new deliveries in the urban core, although neighborhood and price points can produce dramatically different results. With 6,000 units being delivered across the Boston MSA, and more than half of those in the financial district, there are pricing pressures at our assets that compete head-to-head with new product. We also have assets in that same submarket that are somewhat insulated from new deliveries that allow our in-town submarket to lead all other Boston submarkets with year-to-date growth of 4.6%. All other suburban markets show no signs of outsized growth in the near term as future development begins to move back to the suburbs. Additionally, our significant parking garage operations can impact reported revenue growth, depending upon the postseason success of the professional sports teams. Our reported number of 2.8% revenue growth includes those garage performance numbers. Stripping this out, residential results only were 3.2% for the quarter and 3.4% year-to-date and 2.4% sequentially. Jumping down to New York. The pause button is off and the music is playing once again. After seeing rents flat for most of 2013, net effective base rents have bounced between 3% and 5% growth for much of the year. Occupancy has improved 20 basis points year-to-date. Demand has picked up noticeably and we appear to be on solid footing once again. Downtown Brooklyn leads our portfolio in submarket revenue growth year-to-date at 6.5%. The Upper West Side, at 2%, is lagging all other submarkets. However, most all New York City submarkets appear to have accelerating revenue growth as rental rate growth shows favorable [indiscernible]. South Florida. Well, the cranes are back and record prices are being paid for land. Miami-Dade leads the charge across the three-county metro area as wealthy South Americans continue to expand the job base by [indiscernible] their businesses in Miami. All 7 of our three-county submarkets are performing similarly as new supply is manageable in the proving economy. Washington, D.C. continues to perform as expected. With lackluster job growth and outsized supply, positive revenue growth for the metro area continues to be elusive, although net effective base rents across our 8 submarkets can be up 2% one week and down 2% the next. Occupancy and current exposure are all favorable as demand for quality apartments in great locations remained steady and our current residents are staying put, as move-outs for the first half of the year are down more than 400 basis points while we continue to achieve renewal increases above 3%. For D.C. metro submarkets, the Maryland suburbs lead the way. Year-to-date, PG County and the I-270 corridor continue to enjoy positive revenue growth, while South Arlington and Alexandria bring up the rear at minus 2.2% and 1.5% -- 1.56%, respectively. Our district portfolio is negative 58 basis points year-to-date, but August billings are positive 11 basis points versus last August. As we look back to our original guidance, we believed that many of the markets could absorb the new deliveries without major disruption. So far, they have. We also thought that if we could see improved job growth that we could produce better revenue results, and we have. And finally, we knew we had significant opportunity to optimize the Archstone portfolio and deliver exceptional results, and we did, which altogether give us the confidence in raising our guidance for the full year. Mark? Mark J. Parrell: Thank you, David. I want to take a few minutes this morning to review our revised guidance for the year and to give the group some background on our recent debt raise and its impact on our balance sheet. We have provided revised guidance for our same-store metrics as well as our normalized FFO per share for the year. We now expect to produce normalized FFO of $3.08 to $3.12 per share. And that's up $0.02, or about 1%, at the midpoint from our prior range. This growth in normalized FFO, as David Santee just described, is being fueled by our expectation of better-than-expected growth in our net operating income, and that's both in the same-store set and the lease-up set, offset by about $0.02 per share of additional interest expense as a result of our recent debt deal. Our previous guidance included a smaller debt deal later in the year than the one we ended up doing. On the transaction activity side, we did not change our guidance assumptions on volume or cap rate spread. And there was no net impact on our revised normalized FFO guidance from transactions. David Santee reviewed the factors driving our same-store expectations. And I'm pleased to say that we have increased our targeted range on our same-store revenues to 3.9% to 4.1%. And that's up from 3% to 4% from our February guidance. And we've narrowed our expectations on expense growth to a range of 2.25% to 2.75%. And that all results in an expected net operating income range of 4.5% to 5%. And this continues the strong growth we have produced over the last several years and that we continue to expect to deliver. And as a reminder, the Archstone assets we acquired last year had been in our same-store numbers this year since the beginning of the year, both in our sequential, quarterly and year-to-date same-store sets. In June, on the debt side we decided to take advantage of the incredibly attractive rates that were available to us. And we went ahead and issued $1.2 billion of unsecured debt. And we issued 2 pieces of debt. We issued our first true 30-year debt piece and a 5-year issuance. We issued $450 million of unsecured 5-year bonds at an interest rate of 2.4%. And we issued $750 million of 30-year unsecured bonds at an interest rate of 4.54%. We used the proceeds from this offering to repay our $750 million term loan facility, which was scheduled to mature in January of 2015, and to repay the amounts outstanding on our line of credit. These issuances were very well-received by our fixed income investors, particularly the 30-year issuance. In fact, the 30-year bond was issued at the lowest interest rate and the lowest spread above treasuries of any 30-year bond every issued by a REIT, while the 5-year bond issue was priced at near-record low levels. The 5-year bonds were swapped to floating, and we will therefore actually be paying an all-in rate of LIBOR plus about 75 basis points. And right now, all-in that would be around 1% on the $450 million in 5-year bonds that we issued. About 11% of our debt now carries a floating rate. As we draw on our revolver during the balance of the year to repay our September bond maturity and to fund development, floating rate debt will increase until it is about 16% of total debt. And that's right in our 15% to 20% target zone for floating rate debt as compared to total debt. And at the end of the year, I expect our revolver to have a $550 million balance. There were several advantages in our minds to issuing this debt now. The term loan facility was about 50 basis points more costly than the swapped rate on the 5-year notes, so we do have some immediate cost savings. But more importantly, our long-term cost of capital was reduced with such a cheap piece of long-term debt. Also these issuances extended the weighted average maturity of our debt to 7.9 years, which is the longest in the apartment space and one of the longest among all large REITs. When rates do begin to rise, this will be a big advantage to us. Finally, by completing all our 2014 debt refinancing activities and a large portion of our 2015 refinancing activities now, we are in an even better liquidity and funding position over the next couple of years. And now I'll turn the call back over to David Neithercut. David J. Neithercut: All right. Thanks, Mark. Clearly, we remain very excited about the strength and fundamentals that we continue to experience across our markets. And we're going to remain confident that due to a very favorable demographic picture and continued improvement in the overall economy, that we have a lot of runway yet ahead of us for continued favorable revenue and NOI growth, which will result in strong growth and normalized FFO and dividend payments and total shareholder return for years to come. So I just want to make a couple of comments about transaction development activity. We did buy a couple of properties in the second quarter as noted in the release. In Seattle, we closed on a deal that we'd put under contract in 2011 before construction commenced. And that was the 134 units that David Santee mentioned, which we acquired for $36 million. Recently completed and 67% occupied at closing, it's now fully leased and occupied. It should stabilize at a return in the mid-6s. And that deal would trade at a cap rate today in the low 4s. And we also acquired 208 units in Glendale, California about a block from GGP's highly productive Glendale Galleria property. We acquired that property for $70.5 million. It was built in 2013 and was 81% occupied at closing. Today, that deal is 91% leased and 87% occupied and should stabilize at a yield of 5%. The one property we sold in the quarter was in Orlando, Florida, 336 units that we sold for $41 million. And in our press release, we reflect the yield that we sold of being one of 6.7%, and we refer to that as the cap rate. The true cap rate, however, that being the yield that the buyer acquired, would be closer to 6% when adjustments are made for real estate taxes and insurance. Now as Mark said, our guidance for the year remains to buy $500 million of assets and sell $500 million at a cap rate spread of 100 basis points. That said, I'll tell you we are seeing a lot more product in the market, a lot of which we'd very happy to own by trading them with -- into them with proceeds from noncore assets. But bidding remains very competitive and pricing remains very aggressive. So if we're able to find more investment opportunities that make sense for us relative to the assets we desire to sell, and that's an important caveat, then our transaction activity this year could exceed current guidance. Interestingly, if that were to happen though, the cap rate spread might actually decrease or narrow because the incremental assets we might sell will be less desirable assets in our core markets. And these would trade at lower cap rates than the assets we've been selling in our exit markets. Real quickly on development. While we may not have completed nor started any projects this past quarter, there was and remains a great deal of activity taking place. And we currently expect to complete another $254 million of development deals yet this year, which will bring total completions to $621 million or so for the full year. Starts this year currently look like they'll come in around $1 billion. That's slightly higher than our original expectations, which simply means that some early 2015 starts could now occur in late 2014. And that would suggest additional starts yet this year totaling about $500 million. During the second quarter, we acquired one land site also in the Capitol Hill neighborhood due east of downtown Seattle for 140 units, which we'll develop for a total cost of about $45 million. That deal should -- would yield about a 5% at current rents today, and we'd expect to stabilize somewhere in the low to mid-6s. And with this newly-acquired land parcel to our inventory and assuming we do get to $1 billion in starts this year, that would then mean we'd have about 5 development projects that we'd start next year, for 1,200 units at a total construction cost of nearly $600 million. And similarly, those deals would lease at current rents in the mid-5s and stabilize yields in the low to mid-6s. So with that said, operator, we'll be happy to open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll hear first from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : To issue 30-year debt. What made you change your mind on that? Mark J. Parrell: Nick, it's Mark Parrell. Did you ask why did we decide to issue 30-year debt? You were cut off there. Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Yes. David, you talked in the past about maybe reluctance to actually issue 30-year debt. So I'm wondering what changed. Mark J. Parrell: Yes. Well, it's Mark Parrell. We have been thinking about it a while, Nick. And it's been attractive for awhile, but particularly so the last few months. And we've always thought it's a great way to match these long-hold assets we have that we've built and we've bought lately with a long-term low cost of capital. And our anxiety always centered on the covenants, the meaningful covenants that exist in REIT bonds in just binding ourselves for 30 years, who knows what will change in that period of time? But as you look at a rate as well as we were able to get at 4.5% and you look at the average rate the treasury has been, so imagine 10 years from now, we want to repay these bonds. We did a little research, and even in the low-interest climate we've been in lately the last 20 years, about 2/3 of the time, the 20-year treasury has been at or higher than 4.5%, meaning we'd have no prepayment penalty. So in our minds, just boiling it all down, we were getting a great piece of debt. And there is a pretty fair probability that in the future, the company would have the opportunity to take it out for a small or no prepayment penalty if we ever needed to do that. So again, we think it's a great piece of capital to have in the structure long term. Nicholas Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : And then can you talk about what you're seeing in D.C. in terms of the transaction market and if there's any opportunities to acquire there? David J. Neithercut: Well, we've seen a little bit of transaction activity other than a couple of deals that have traded before any lease-up occurred to avoid the TOPA transaction issues. But I will tell you that I'm not quite sure I can define any of that as an opportunity. We think those were still very aggressively priced. So not unlike what David has said just in terms of total operations, things are going reasonably well in D.C. given the supply. We're just not seeing a great deal of transaction activity at prices that we would consider to be opportunistic. Operator : Nick Yulico with UBS has the next question. Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Just turning to your guidance and your outlook on the markets. I mean, if you look, it sounds like D.C. got a little bit worse in the second quarter. New York City got a lot better. West Coast was still very good, and Boston got a little bit weaker. How are you expecting those markets to play out in the second half of the year? Is it going to be something similar? And what's the big sort of variance -- where could the big variance to your guidance be? Is it Boston getting weaker, D.C. getting weaker or New York City getting even better? David S. Santee: This is David Santee. We've already issued renewals out through August and September. And really when you just look at the flow of the numbers, once you lock down September, it's really hard to move the full year numbers. And really the only way to move the full year numbers significantly would be having a significant drop in occupancy. So that's why we're confident in our range, in our very tight range. Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And then your occupancy comps, I'm assuming you feel pretty good about in the second half of the year? David S. Santee: Yes. I mean, we already have notices through September. Those are normal to lower than last year, which would imply we maintained the same level of occupancy. And then really, there are so few transactions in the fourth quarter relative to the full year, it's just very hard to move the full-year-number. Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And then just turning to the development pipeline, can you just remind us where you're expecting the stabilized yields for the pipeline in place today, and whether you've now think that those yields could be higher than you thought they were, say, last year? David J. Neithercut: Well, I guess, everything that we delivered last year is probably performing better than expectations just because for all the comments David had said about how well we're doing in our markets. What we're working on today, starting today and expect to start is really a story of 5s and 6s. It's a story of deals yielding at current rents somewhere in the 5s and we think are stabilized 2 years or so out or 3 years out in the 6s. Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And is that consistent with the existing pipeline? Or is the existing pipeline yield a little bit higher? David J. Neithercut: Well, the existing pipeline, you mean those things under construction today? Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Yes, that's right. And what's been recently delivered. David J. Neithercut: What's been recently completed would be in excess of that. Right, so anything to start in 2011 is really gangbusters. Everything you start in 2012 would be a little lesser than, et cetera, et cetera. So now it's down to a point where anything started today would yield in the 5s at current rents and again we would expect to yield at 6%. Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay, got you. And just one last question, David. You mentioned acquisitions maybe being more attractive today, yet there's a significant spread where you could be buying at a lower initial yield than where you're selling. How do you balance that if you're also trying to create earnings growth? I mean, that sounds like that would be a dilutive process. David J. Neithercut: Well, no company knows more about that than Equity Residential after all the activity we've taken place and we've conducted over the past half a dozen or so years. But that's certainly part of the balancing process. And we would balance that, as I noted in my opening comments, by selling assets in core markets that would be less desirable assets. And we would sell those at lower cap rates than exit markets. And again I don't -- didn't mean to suggest that we thought acquisitions were more attractive. What I suggested was that we expected to see more opportunity, but what we are seeing today remains very, very competitively sought for and pricing to be very aggressive. So we're going to see more product. We'll see if we're able to make sense of the pricing of that product relative to the proceeds and yields we'll be able to sell and raise capital assets to your point, because we do want to manage that dilution. Our sort of pledge to the market has been that the dilution experience is part of this transformation that we've taken place over the past 6 years or so will slow considerably. And we aim to deliver on that. Operator : Moving on to Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors. David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : The cost savings that you outlined as having achieved on the Archstone portfolio are pretty impressive, especially considering that Archstone was considered to be a good operator. Can you talk about how those compare to the general cost savings opportunities you see in the broader transaction market? Were you able to save more or less on that integration than what you generally expect as you underwrite deals? David S. Santee: I would say typically, we -- it's hard to look back and say what we actually say because we don't really have new acquisitions' previous results, so to speak. I mean, we just underwrite it. But I would say, typically, what we see are the 3 areas of opportunity are always leasing and advertising, payroll and turn costs. I can't say that most acquisitions produce that degree of savings. David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then on the transaction market, David, can you just talk about why you think that you're seeing more opportunities than you expected this year? What's the nature of the sellers? Are these... David J. Neithercut: I think pricing has been very strong, and I think sellers of assets that think that they will likely want to monetize their interests sometime in the near future are thinking this might be a good time. And a lot of that feedback comes from the brokerage network that do let us know that they've been requested by sellers to give their opinions of value. And normally, when more of those inquiries are made, that then does produce more deals coming to the marketplace. So I will say, however, though that there have been several instances in which properties have been pulled back from market because the perhaps sellers' overly-inflated expectations failed to be met. But the brokerages are telling us more is coming. We are certainly seeing more. And I think it's just more of a desire of shorter-term holders thinking today would be a great opportunity to monetize their equity investment. David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And what's the landscape for portfolio purchase opportunities? David J. Neithercut: There have been a few out there. Some concentrations in some markets, and then some larger portfolios of disparate assets across lots of markets, some of which would be considered as sort of noncore from our perspective. But I would not say that there has been an abundant amount of sort of larger portfolios. There have been just a small handful. David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And the last question is as you talk about starting to sell some of the noncore assets or less desirable assets within your core markets, can you just walk us through the process in which you analyze your own portfolio and discuss the attributes to some of the assets that you might be selling from these markets? Are they older? Are they more suburban? Any insight like that would be great. David S. Santee: Yes and yes. All right. They remain older assets and more the sort of suburban circus park garden kind of product. Suburban D.C. is an example, Inland Empire, some stuff in various submarkets of Southern California, maybe even of Seattle. So if there are assets that ultimately we know that because of their age and location might not be long-term holds for us, and if there are opportunities to sell those at attractive yields relative to what we can buy, we'd be more than happy to make those trades. But there's no pressing need to do so today. Operator : Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch has the next question. Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : For David Santee, can you comment on what the new lease rent growth was in July? David S. Santee: New lease rent, I have it for the quarter, which was 5.5%. Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : And then any comments on As versus Bs within your portfolio? David S. Santee: Well, when I look at our results, and I tried to allude to that in my prepared remarks, I guess I would just say, \"It depends.\" It depends on what the -- where you are in the market, what type of supply you have, what type of new product is coming online. We have some of our best-performing urban assets in Boston are B communities. Some of our best-performing assets in Seattle are B communities. So it's really a mix of location, which I think is becoming more and more critical. I think people are looking for a place that is going to shape their lifestyle. Neighborhood is ultra important. And I think if you're in those neighborhoods, both As and Bs will perform equally well. Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : And then maybe just a quick question on the transaction market. Just maybe, David, your view on whether you're seeing any -- there's only a small amount of portfolios, but whether those are looking like they would get premiums. Or could they actually be at a little bit of a discount because there's only a limited number of buyers that could take down a very large portfolio? David J. Neithercut: Well, it doesn't take an awful lot of buyers. It only takes 2. And I think it's very possible you could see some premium pricing on those portfolios because of size. Again, there's an awful lot of capital chasing few deals in the space. And if one has a desire to get capital out in the multifamily segment, a large portfolio may be a way to do that. And that could result in maybe some modest premium pricing. Operator : Moving on to Ryan Peterson with Sandler O'Neill. Ryan Peterson : You've talked about your ability to grow rents this quarter. There seems to be a lull in land large ability [ph] to push rents at the end of '13, the beginning of this year. Do you think that was seasonal? Or did it just take some time for renters to adapt to the new asking levels? David S. Santee: I would say, in general, there is -- at the top level, portfolio level, there is definitely seasonality in the pricing. We track that. We've tracked it for the last 8 years. And basically, rents, call it, rents drift off 3% to 5% in Q4 and Q1 just because of lack of demand. Ryan Peterson : And then on a separate note, do you think there's going to be a trend of more condo and apartment deals like yours at Toll Brothers? And if not, what are the challenges that would limit more of these deals? David J. Neithercut: Well, I guess, it's -- we've had a very successful transaction that we've done with Toll Brothers. And I will tell you we have had numerous conversations with others on similar opportunities. But a lot of things have to come together. Pricing for the apartments have to make sense. Pricing for the condos have to make sense. The totality needs to make sense relative to the land pricing, et cetera, et cetera. And so I'm not -- I would not be surprised to see more of that, not unlike mixed-use projects you've seen. We've got a lovely property in Manhattan that's above a hotel, for instance. I think it's a great way to share cost and to mitigate risk. But again, it's just one of those things that's got to come together. It just adds more complexity and more moving parts that just makes it more difficult to accomplish. Operator : We'll now hear from Ryan Bennett with Zelman & Associates. Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC: I appreciate the color by submarkets in your prepared remarks. Just curious where you see the peak of new deliveries across your submarkets now versus what you saw probably at the beginning of the year. David S. Santee: Well, you mean for '14? Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Yes. I guess, when you're expecting the highest number of deliveries across your submarkets. David S. Santee: Yes. So I think that the easiest way to look at it is just the calendar year. I mean, when we kind of review each of these markets on a quarterly basis, which we did last week, it was clear that about 60% -- we're about 60% of the way through our deliveries at the top level, so -- which means you have 40% to go. Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Got it. And how do you see that playing out into 2015? Does the comp get significantly better across your submarkets based on the data that you have? David S. Santee: Well, I guess, I would say we made some minor changes to deliveries this year. But they're only going to be pushed into 2015. So when you look at 2014 and 2015 combined, the totals haven't really changed. So we would expect declines in deliveries next year. And hopefully, with continued improving job growth, a great GDP number today, that the economy will continue to improve, and we'll continue down this path of absorbing units with relatively little disruption to our day-to-day business. Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Okay, great. And then just to follow up. I think in your prepared comments, you mentioned Boston is typically seeing some increasing development shifting back towards the suburbs. Have you seen that in any other of your major markets? David S. Santee: Yes. So when you -- probably the most obvious is Washington, D.C. You start to see development move back out to Reston and outside the Beltway beginning next year and beyond. Every other market, not so much. Operator : The next question comes from Richard Anderson with Mizuho. Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division : Just a couple maybe smaller events that maybe tell a bigger story. The first is to Mark Parrell, swapping to floating. It seems like you're getting a little greedy there. Can you talk about that strategy to go floating from a good rate to begin with? Mark J. Parrell: Our thought -- we have a strategy on that, Rich. I mean, what we're trying to do is avail ourselves of 2 different points on that debt cost curve. And long is great, 30-year is terrific. And the other side we like is LIBOR. We think being floating rate and being short when LIBOR is 25 basis points, and feels like for the near term it'll be around that number, that feels pretty good to us. And I think with the kind of portfolio we have with the lease growth we expect, if rates do go up because, as David Santee just alluded to, we have more growth, then I think the revenue line and the interest expense line item will move in sync, and it will all make good sense. So I guess, I would say I don't get particularly greedy about that. I think that was part of the strategy. David J. Neithercut: And we take[indiscernible]. Mark J. Parrell: Yes. I mean, we're incrementally down on floating rate debt. We're lower than most of the guys in the apartment space right now. But we'll end up at about 15%, 16% by the end of the year. Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then to the land purchase in Seattle, despite the nice GDP number today, it seems like there and elsewhere you're kind of operating fundamentally at a hyper level -- good, solid demand offsetting increases in supply. And I'm just curious with Seattle, in particular, you have a lot of supply going on. The rationale to continue developing that market maybe, is that -- what's the thought process there? I mean, it seems like it's been great but maybe again getting a little greedy. Mark J. Parrell: Well, again we've got a very low, relatively low, percentage of our income coming out of that marketplace. This was just about a $45 million total cost project, so not quite sure how a $35 billion company can be greedy with a $45 million development deal. And then I also suggested that in response to one of the other questions that some of what we may sell maybe some suburban Seattle stuff. I mean, what we're building is kind of downtown close-in, in Capitol Hill, in South Lake Union, in Ballard downtown. So we like those locations. And as David said, we're performing very well in those locations. So again, at less than 7% current NOI exposure, I'm not quite sure that doing a $45 million deal is getting us over our skis in Seattle. Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division : Fair enough. And then bigger picture, David, the 2 deals in the second quarter acquisitions were kind of a value-add sort of swing to it with buying some vacancy. Do you think that will be more and more a part of the acquisition story for you to get reasonable pricing on deals to take on a little bit of lease-up risk in the front end? David J. Neithercut: Well, the one deal, we put under contract in 2011, so it was not a recent decision on that. The one deal we did buy in Glendale was that. And we bought vacant properties, maybe half a dozen vacant properties. So I think that anything that we do that we believe gives us a competitive advantage to buy a property at a more attractive price is something that we'll do. So we're certainly not afraid of that. And that again was an example of someone looking to monetize their interest in a good market, and not willing to sort of wait the extra 6 months or year for a deal to get stabilized. And we're happy to be there to take advantage of that. And again, we'd buy the deal at stabilized 5%, then trade it at a low 4%, maybe even a high 3%. So it's one way a company of our size can take advantage of our balance sheet to maybe get a premium return. Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then last question maybe for Santee. 30 -- I'm sorry, $20 million in incremental rental revenue, second quarter versus first quarter, understanding the seasonality issues and the strong performance during the quarter. But is that a good number? Or is there anything kind of lumpy in the second quarter revenue number, top line? David S. Santee: Just pure, good revenue, Rich. Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division : Okay. So my NAV is now $80. Operator : Vahid Khorsand with BWS Financial has the next question. Vahid Khorsand - BWS Financial Inc.: First question, on the Washington, D.C. market, it looks like it's stable but has -- could grow and could improve. Is that what it looks like to you? David S. Santee: Well, D.C., we have, what, 20,000 deliveries this year? We're roughly 60% through that. However, when I look at our billings today, we are, for the month, minus 10 basis points. So we are seeing better occupancy. We are seeing the net effective base rents stabilize. I mean, as I mentioned, some weeks, they can be up 2%. Next week, they could be down 1%. It really just depends on what's available and where and to what degree that impacts the portfolio. But I guess, I would say that I'm very pleased with how D.C. is behaving. And if the next 6 months are like the last 6 months, then I think we're setting the stage for some reasonable stable performance. Vahid Khorsand - BWS Financial Inc.: With that in mind, do you think we're approaching a timeframe where you might be looking to add assets in the D.C. market? David J. Neithercut: Yes, I responded to a similar question earlier suggesting that what we've seen in terms of pricing, what's taken place, is that there have been not anything we define as opportunity. So I don't think that's a market that we're going to be pursuing at the current time. But we never say never. If, not unlike the lease-up deals we just did, we found something that we thought we could do at a premium, we may very well do that. And we'd pair that with a sale of something onto the suburban market so that net exposure would not increase. Vahid Khorsand - BWS Financial Inc.: Okay. And my final question on the leasing and advertising line, what do you attribute to the drop that seems to be happening every quarter on that? Is that related to the efficiencies through the Archstone deal? Or is that something else? David S. Santee: Well, I guess, I would say that it's related to the Archstone inclusion. However, the savings is spread across the entire legacy portfolio. And probably the best example, if you go to New York City, where we have 2 properties right across the street, Archstone used to be in ForRent, in Apartments.com and what-have-you. And we would have our property in all those same 3 or 4 ILSs. And basically, what we do is we go in and we optimize so that perhaps the Archstone property goes from 4 ILSs down to 2. And our property goes from 4 ILSs down to 2. And we'd cross-sell those properties on our website, so you're basically eliminating half of your ILS spend due to the closed proximity of the assets. Operator : We'll now hear from George Hoglund with Jefferies. George Hoglund - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : I just have 2 questions. The first one is on Orange County. Since it's had some strong performance this year so far, they've got increasing supply coming on in the first half of '15, how do you view that market being able to absorb that supply? David S. Santee: It's -- we've seen extremely good job growth in Orange County. I would say that there's maybe 1 or 2 large deals that could have some short-term impact. But we feel very comfortable that, that market can absorb the supply that's on the books as of today. George Hoglund - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then just the second question is with the homebuilders moving moreso into the multifamily development, how do you view that going forward as sort of impacting things in terms of will it be moreso deals like your existing deal with Toll? Or do you think that it will be moreso homebuilders just doing these deals on their own? And do you think this will have a significant pressure on supply or potential pressure on supply going forward? David J. Neithercut: Well, from what we understand, from my conversations with the few that are doing it, is it's more of the latter. It's just them thinking it's a good business for them to be in directly. But I think thus far, it's really been in markets in which they've got large single-family home presences and just really haven't bumped up [indiscernible]. It's a lot of Sunbelt product that we just don't think competes with us. So at the present time, we don't see it as a competitive threat to us. Operator : We'll now hear from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : It's Michael Bilerman. I just had a couple of quick follow-ups. One is just sort of capital structure. If your thinking has evolved on the 30-year debt, I'm curious how you're thinking is on common equity. And the reason I ask is when you did the Archstone deal, you obviously issued a billing in the, call it -- I think it was $54.75-ish [ph], if I remember correctly, stock is up north of 20% since then. I guess, how do you think about using equity? If you can't find the dispositions or you haven't brought stuff to market and you find some acquisition opportunities, would you use equity? David J. Neithercut: It's certainly [indiscernible] in our quarter. I guess, we're at a point, Michael, where we continue to have some odds and ends of assets that we'd like to use as the capital to provide proceeds to buy whatever we think we may like to do out there. I don't think there's anything that's terribly important or strategic or overly compelling for us at the current juncture. So my guess is our expectation would be to buy with what we can with what we can sell, to buy assets at these prices and issue stocks at these prices. I mean, maybe there's some modest kind of arbitrage in there, but over 375 million shares I'm not quite sure that there's a whole lot of purpose there. But we certainly do look at all of the [indiscernible] capital -- all of the different segments of capital. And Mark and his team have done a great job across the debt side. And obviously, we're very pleased with where our stock is today and have that be at a place where it might make sense to actually do that. But again, that's also a function of what [indiscernible] you can buy and what the right proceeds. And we always consider all of those options. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I guess, there's no need for what you have on your plate today to even tap the ATM? David J. Neithercut: That's correct. I mean, our development pipeline, as Mark has said over the past several calls, between free cash flow, the disposition of proceeds, we can manage the pipeline of development that we have. So we are not obligated to go into the market to address them. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. And then I assume there's been no change or evolution in terms of how you're thinking about some of the adjuncts to housing, whether it be single-family rental, student housing, senior housing. There hasn't been any shift in your or Sam's thinking on any of that, has there? David J. Neithercut: That's correct. There has been no shifts. We looked at single-family years ago and didn't see it as anything but a distraction. And as we think about the markets we're in today, the assets we own and operate, they're attractive to students. They're attractive to seniors. And we don't think we need to move into sort of purpose-built product to access those 2 segments. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. Just last one on conversion to condos, anything that you're sort of working on where you can sort of raise capital that would be a pretty low effective cap rate? I know you talked about selling some potential core assets -- noncore assets in core markets, but I'm curious as the conversion play. David J. Neithercut: Well, so far, I think that's been a little bit more talk than action. I think that certainly, we look at our assets and there could be condominium premium embedded in those. But so far, that's probably been more talk. We've seen pricing on the post trade that seemed to have been gone off at some kind of premium. Again, a lot of that is a function of what are you going to do with the proceeds, because those have to be reinvested. But certainly, it's something that we're thoughtful of and keeping an eye on. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Can you do that on any of Upper West Side buildings, the Trump buildings? David J. Neithercut: You mean structurally? Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Well, I just think the pricing of what Extell is doing. David J. Neithercut: Say it again? Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : The pricing of what Extell is building south of that obviously would mean a very high value as condos for some of those buildings. David J. Neithercut: Well, obviously, that's extremely brand-new product being built to a particular spec. You can't necessarily extrapolate that directly to a product that was built as apartments that could be now 15 years ago. But clearly, we're aware of what's happening and the timing of activity around our properties. I'll also sort of tell you that much of what you read about condos in a place like New York City with a very high-end luxury, large price point stop, and you read very little about what's happening at the more middle range. But it's something we'll keep a close eye on. Operator : And our next question will come from Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets. Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : A couple of quick follow-ups there. David Santee, you mentioned a 5.5% on new leases. I think that was second quarter. Do you have the -- is that a year-to-date? Or do you have a lease-over-lease rate there? And then also given the occupancy and lower move-outs that you're seeing, can you talk about the strategy with new leases in the back half of the year, whether you expect to continue to hold that out a bit more or you expect that to follow more normal seasonality? David S. Santee: Yes, I'm glad you asked that question because I quoted the renewal rate at 5.5%, 5.5% versus the new lease. So the base rent year-over-year is 4%. So new leases are 4%, renewals are 5.5%, and then the combined for Q2 is 4.1%. Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then how does that translate to the back half of the year strategy in terms of new lease rates? Do you expect anything different relative to the normal seasonality we've seen the last couple of years? David S. Santee: No, I think what we see year after year is that rates will drift down. I mean, we are attempting, as we discussed previously, to minimize those expirations in Q4, to minimize that drift in both the occupancy and rental rate. In a place like D.C., we're probably going to be a little more defensive in maintaining that occupancy only because we're not done yet. We still have another year of big deliveries. And the stronger we can maintain occupancy in a market that's delivering units, the more pricing power or the less susceptible we are to having to give concessions. So that will be our strategy in that market. But typically, the seasonal pattern is identical year after year after year. It's just -- but what we see is that we see the same gaps. So if rents are up 4% today, we would expect that -- those rents to drift off, but still be 4% above last year in Q4. Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : That's helpful. And then David, just the $500 million you've identified as your acquisition and disposition target, how much of that has actually been identified at this point? You talked about a potentially large pipeline. But just curious of the opportunities you're looking at today, how much of that has been identified? David J. Neithercut: I mean, I guess, enough of it that we think that the $500 million and $500 million can and will be achieved. And I guess, again my comment is we think that as the year progresses, there will be more opportunity and perhaps we'll have an opportunity to identify more. But as we looked at what was kicking around out there that we were working on under contract, et cetera, we've felt confident that $500 million and $500 million was still doable. Operator : And gentlemen, we have no further questions. Mr. McKenna, I'll turn the conference back to you for closing or additional remarks. Marty McKenna : All right. Thank you all very much. Enjoy August and the rest of summer. And I'm sure we'll see a lot of you around in September. Thanks for joining us today. Operator : And again ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you all for your participation.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead. Marty McKenna : Thank you, Pam. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's third quarter results. Our featured speakers today are : David Neithercut, our President and CEO; and David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer. Mark Parrell, our Chief Financial Officer, is also with us for the Q&A. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. And now I'll turn it over to David Neithercut. David J. Neithercut: Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our call. As we've said for quite some time, that we're very confident. The impact on multifamily fundamentals by the millennial generation and their desire to live in high density, urban environments with the flexibility and optionality provided by rental housing would produce an extended runway of growth for our portfolio. That is certainly what we are seeing today and expect to see for the foreseeable future. Thanks to a great leasing season and the hard work of our teams across the country, we expect to deliver same-store revenue growth for the full year of 4.1%, which is above our original expectations and at the high end of our most recent guidance. This comes from continued exceptional growth from usual suspects, markets that are enjoying strong job growth and are highly attractive to young millennials, such as San Francisco, Seattle and Denver, along with very solid performance from other markets, including Southern California. This strong revenue growth will help produce full year 2014 normalized funds from operations of $3.12 to $3.14 per share. The results are above both our original and most recent guidance and represent a year-over-year increase in normalized FFO of nearly 10%, an increase that is among the largest we've experienced in the last 15 years. And it's because of the incredible portfolio we've assembled over the last few years, concentrated in high density, urban markets with close proximity to public transportation, dining, culture, education, nightlife and the like. The demand for high-quality rental housing in these markets remain very strong. Occupancies were at all-time highs for this time of the year. Renewal increases are at the highest they've been all year and our current left to lease remains below normal levels. In short, fundamentals remain very good. With continued strong demand for quality rental housing like that provided by every residential, and we're delighted with where we are currently positioned with our performance this year, and we all eagerly await the year ahead. So with that said, I'll now let David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer, discuss in more detail what we're seeing across our markets today and how that is shaping our thoughts about 2015. David S. Santee: Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. We are extremely pleased to produce another very strong quarter, and I would like to take a moment to recognize everyone on the EQR team for all of their extra efforts during our peak leasing season and continued excellence in the execution of our operational strategies. Our reported third quarter revenue growth of 4.1% and commitment to delivering results at the top end of our revised revenue guidance represents continued strength in fundamentals and acceleration in many of our key drivers of revenue growth. First, this change in physical turnover. Although we reported a slight increase, it is directly attributable to an increase in the number of intra-property transfers, meaning, residents moving between apartments in the same community. Netting out transfers for the quarter, resident turnover was flat and down 150 basis points year-to-date. We also believe it's important to understand the motivations and economic impact behind these transfers, which represent over 10% of move outs in any given year. Through September, 64% of all these intra-property transfers moved to a larger and/or more expensive apartment, paying an average increase in rent of $349. All transfers, both up and down, produced an average favorable rent change of $66 per month. The continued decline in turnover helped by a 90-basis point quarter-over-quarter reduction in move outs to buy homes gave us confidence to maintain our aggressive pricing strategy despite record deliveries and lease-ups across many of our markets. Net effective base rents have increased 6.7% year-to-date and for the third quarter average 4.5% greater than Q3 of '13. Renewal rates achieve accelerated for the fourth time in 4 quarters moving from 5.2% in Q4 of '13 to a very strong 6% in Q3. We would expect to see similar results through the year end though transactions will be few. Increased demand as a result of an improving job market allowed us to maintain our aggressive stance with pricing, but also realize substantial occupancy gains during the peak leasing season, increasing from 95.7% in '13 to 96.1% this quarter. Year-to-date, occupancy stands at 95.7%, a 30-basis point improvement. And as we sit here today, occupancy is 96.2% versus 95.4% same week last year, with 120-basis point improvement in left to lease down to 5.9%. Looking out over the fourth quarter, we, of course, anticipate the typical seasonal slowdown. However, our net effective base rents remain elevated over same week last year, creating year-over-year net effective rent growth in excess of 5%, the highest year-to-date. Should this trend continue and we don't experience the full effects of the normal seasonal decline in both rents and occupancy, it is possible that we can slightly exceed our revised full year revenue growth of 4.1%. Now going around the horn with some brief market highlights, Seattle continues to outperform with 100 basis points better occupancy. Renewals achieved for September and October are above 9%, and net effective base rents are up 5.7% versus same week last year. Our delivery estimates for 2014 and '15 are 7,800 and 7,300 units, respectively. Growing relocations of various company and regional headquarters, Oracle as an example, offer encouraging signs of continued diversified demand in the urban core. Amazon alone has over 4,800 open positions in its downtown locations. San Francisco, the only question here is how high can it go. With few deliveries relative to demand, San Francisco's positioned yet again to lead the way. Renewals achieved for September and October were once again above 10%. Occupancy today is 97.1%, which is 130 basis points better than same time last year, and left to lease is 170 basis points better at 4.7%. Net effective base rents are 12.5% above same week last year, and there are no indications that this will slow down in the next couple of quarters. Now like the other West Coast markets, L.A., Orange County and San Diego are all experiencing 80 to 90 basis points improvement in occupancy and lower left to lease. All 3 are experiencing broad-based job growth and improving fundamentals. L.A. will see elevated deliveries in 2015 at 8,800 units. However, the downtown area is quickly establishing itself as the place to be, pressuring the West L.A., Santa Monica and Marina submarkets, which are also in a repositioned play as the Silicon Beach. Playing host to new tech startups and satellite location for the Googles of the world, providing more affordable living options relative to its Northern California headquarters. Orange County remained solid with 2,900 new deliveries slated for 2015. While job growth is broad-based, the majority of deliveries will be concentrated in Irvine, where job growth is 5x the growth of Orange County as a whole. Jumping East, going to Boston, it will continue to be pressured in the financial district in Cambridge, as new lease ups come online. Concessions in the 2- to 3-month range are commonplace, but the net effective costs of the 12-month lease remains higher than stabilized well established product. Occupancies remained healthy with 7,000 units absorbed year-to-date, with 5,100 deliveries slated for 2015. Seasonal demand is very pronounced in Boston, and we would expect moderation in occupancy and rental rate growth through Q1 of next year. Now in New York, we are continuing to deliver solid and steady growth in Manhattan. And for definitional purposes, Manhattan also includes Brooklyn and Williamsburg, and we delivered a 4.2% for the quarter. With elevated deliveries in both Brooklyn and the Jersey Waterfront, we would expect some moderation in Brooklyn, but significant pricing pressures in Jersey. With continued strong population growth, well diversified job creation in Silicon Valley, Manhattan should be a solid steady performer for years to come. Now it's no secret that South Florida is at it again with almost 11,000 deliveries for '14 and another 12,000 in 2015. With over 50% of the deliveries in the Miami Brickell submarket and the balance East of 95 from Fort Lauderdale North, the EQR portfolios should be well insulated both geographically and by price point. Saving the best for last, Washington, D.C., thus far, continues to hold up pretty well. Renewals achieved remained above 3% for the quarter and through September. Over 14,000 units have been absorbed year-to-date and our portfolio continues to perform slightly better than our original 2014 expectations. With another 12,600 units coming online in '15, we remain cautiously optimistic that next year's results will be similar to slightly worse than 2014. More than half of '15 deliveries are located outside the Beltway, concentrated in the I-270 corridor and South on U.S. 1 between Pentagon City and South Alexandria. The RBC corridor, Arlington and D.C. proper all have significantly fewer deliveries going forward and to date have been some of our better performing submarkets. Expenses for the quarter increased 60 basis points year-over-year and are up 1.7% year-to-date. Third quarter expenses were favorably impacted by the adjustment for full year real estate taxes as a result of 2 significant appeals that we won in Florida. We just didn't expect to resolve those appeals this year, but those came through late in the quarter. Continued reductions in property management costs as a result of efficiencies drive from the Archstone integration and restructuring as well as natural gas and electric costs continued to moderate with utilities declining 1.3%. For full year '14, we would expect expense growth to be 2.2%. With year-to-date expenses of 1.7%, Q4 expense is expected to grow 3.6% will be driven by slightly higher utility costs, real estate tax of 5.7% and higher payroll costs as a result of stabilized operations from the Archstone integration. Now as we think about 2015 and our preliminary guidance of 3.5% to 4.5% top line growth, we'll be making adjustments to our 3 buckets of market revenue growth. Washington, D.C. will continue in a bucket of its own with a revenue decline of approximately 1% again for 2015. While D.C. has absorbed more than 14,000 units thus far, we are still at the midpoint of delivering a combined 30,000 units for this year and next. Our middle bucket of 3% to 5% revenue growth will consist of Boston and New York. New York should produce full year results similar to 2014, while Boston will be closer to 3%. Our plus 5% revenue growth markets continue to be led by San Francisco, Denver and Seattle. Los Angeles should be a solid plus 5% performer with Orange County, San Diego and South Florida crossing the 5% threshold early in the year. For expenses, 2015 are built from the ground up. But as we think about them today, real estate taxes will have [indiscernible] handle and make up 34% of total expense. We should see moderate growth in payroll as a result of diminishing returns from the Archstone integration. However, utilities should produce meaningful year-over-year reductions in costs, as a result of lower natural gas and electricity costs. All combined, real estate taxes payroll and utilities make up almost 71% of total expense. With that in mind, we would expect 2015 expense to be modestly higher compared to 2014 with more color to come on our Q4 call. So we are mindful that many markets will continue to have elevated deliveries. We believe that improved job growth is upon us and delays in marriage are creating additional demand. People of all walks of life are seeking a lifestyle in the city and renting by choice. Owning a home is no longer a required variable in the calculus of achieving the American dream, and homeownership rates continue to decline. Certainly, this must be a formula for outsized demand for quality apartments that should produce above trend revenue growth for some time to come. David? David J. Neithercut: All right, thanks, Dave. Now clearly, we remain excited about the strength and fundamentals we continue to experience across our markets. As David noted, really driven by an improving economy, steadily improving job growth and recovering unemployment rate, we remain confident that due to a very favorable demographic picture and the noted changing lifestyles, plus millennials staying single longer and they really are embracing the flexibility provided by high-density rental housing within close proximity to their friends and their favorite activities. We've got a lot of run rate ahead of us for continued strong revenue and NOI growth, which will result in favorable growth in normalized FFO and our dividends payments as total shareholder return for years to come. With the heavy lifting of our portfolio transformation behind us, our transaction activity today is more fine tuning in nature as we complete a few remaining market exits and redeploy that capital in the longer-term core market investments. We sold 3 non-core assets in the third quarter, 2 25-year-old garden assets in Florida and a 44-year-old asset 100 miles west of Boston, Massachusetts. We realized an 11.8% unleveraged IRR inclusive of management cost on those deals. During the quarter, we bought one property, 308 units in North Hollywood, California that had been built in 2013. Our guidance for the year remains to buy $500 million of assets and sell $500 million at a spread of 100 basis points, and that spread being the difference between the yield we are selling, and that which are buying. This suggests that we have $125 million of acquisitions yet to do this year and $300 million more in dispositions, all of which must be done significantly tighter than the 140 basis point spread realized year-to-date. We're currently working on a couple of acquisitions that could get us to our $500 million target, we hope to close by year end at high-4 yields. And on disposition front, in addition to the nearly $200 million sold to the first 9 months of the year, thus far in the fourth quarter, we've sold a couple of yields in Orlando for $150 million at 6% yield. And we have a half a dozen other disposition candidates in various stages of the process. And several of these deals represent less desirable assets but in our core markets that will trade at yields in the low to middle 5s, which is significantly lower than those realized in our exit markets and will bring our weighted average disposition yield to somewhere near the high 5s by the end of the year. And lastly, I'll reiterate that the disposition yields we provide are the forward 12-month yields that we are selling. The true cap rate, however, really that being the yield that the buyer acquired is significantly lower than our disposition yield when adjustments are made for increases in real estate taxes and insurance. Now we're excited to commence construction in the third quarter on a 40-story tower in downtown Seattle on Pine Street, just 2 blocks from Pike Place market. This asset is expected to cost $200 million net of some additional air rights that we expect to sell at a later date. The tower will be delivered in 2017, and produce a yield on cost in the high 4s on today's market rents, and it's expected to stabilize in the upper 5s. This trend transaction brings 2014 starts to date to $829 million, which includes 2 high-rise towers, 1 in downtown San Francisco and that which we just started in Seattle. It's also possible that 2 additional projects could begin yet this year, totaling $300 million, which are also in San Francisco and Seattle. But if they don't get underway yet this year, they most certainly will early in 2015. We completed roughly $500 million of development projects this year, and we currently expect these new assets to deliver low- to mid-6% returns on current rents in markets where core product trades solidly in the 4s, such as downtown LA, Seattle and Pasadena. We also have another $830 million of projects underway that will be completed in 2015 and our current forecast are that next year's deliveries will yield in the low 6s. This includes 2 new towers in New York City and new product in San Francisco, San Jose and Seattle. During the third quarter, we acquired one land site for the 2016 start of a 33-story tower in the financial district of downtown L.A. containing 428 units, for a total development cost of $200 million, mid-5% yields at current rents, and we'd expect that yield to stabilize in the mid-6s. So before I open the call to questions, I'd like to give a little shout out to the entire team at equity for having recently been recognized by GRESB as the residential large cap sector leader in sustainability. Sustainability is an important initiative here, one that is not only the right thing to do, but one that is having a strong bottom line return for the company and we're very proud of the work that Lou Schotsky and many others around the country have been doing to produce such positive results and favorable recognition. So, Pam, we'll be happy to open the call to questions now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Nick Joseph from Citi. Nicholas Gregory Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : David, you talked about the strong multifamily fundamentals and clearly, we're seeing them in the results and the outlook. What's the largest risk to the strong multifamily outlook going forward? David J. Neithercut: Well, look, I think that the demographic picture is very strong. We're certainly seeing the job growth in the markets in which we operate. I tell you, the things that we think about as sort of risks to us are safety and security of our center cities. But I think that's not an immediate concern. But that's something that we've talked a lot about. I'll tell you that I think one of the limiting factors on the growth of these and the long-term power of these center cities is public education. I think that's something that will send a lot of people to the suburbs. But I think that the demand for housing in these cities there today, the jobs are being located there, the companies are relocating back to the city, we're seeing here in Chicago on a regular basis. And we're obviously very optimistic about the long-term upside of the sort of this reurbanization of the country today. Nicholas Gregory Joseph - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Then in terms of the balance sheet, you have $450 million on the line right now and $300 million of higher-coupon debt coming due in April. What are your thoughts on addressing those? And could we see opportunistic in the near-term given where rates are? Or is that more of a 2015? Mark J. Parrell: Hey, Nick, it's Mark Parrell. I think even more as a 2015 thing. We have done some hedging in anticipation of that maturity as well, as some secured debt maturities we have later in 2015. So right now, our expectation is that we would deal with that in 2015, given that we have the protection on the hedges. But we'll watch the market and if something really changes dramatically, I guess, we could do something, but right now, that's not our expectation. Operator : We'll go next to Dave Bragg from Green Street Advisors. David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : Last quarter, you suggested that there was a lot of product on the transaction market and seems to suggest that there was a possibility that you would exceed your acquisition guidance for the year. David, could you talk a little bit more about what you've seen over the last few months and the opportunities that may have not materialized? David J. Neithercut: Well, we've certainly seen more product this year. And there's certainly more activity, transaction activity this year than a year ago. I tell you, there has been lots of things that have traded that we've watched very closely and decided not to bid on or bid this sort of stay in the process, but knowing that we would not get just given how aggressive pricing can be for the kind of product that we'd be happy to own -- add to our portfolio. There have been deals that have been shocked in portfolios that have been withdrawn because seller's expectation of the portfolio did not met. And they'll now, perhaps be broken up and be sold individually. And we may or may not transact on some of those individually. And frankly, I tell you, there are some portfolios that have been buyers or sellers expectations were met and they've just kind of been pulled from the market. So there certainly has been an increase. We've bird-dog kind of all of it. But we now think that we felt has been particularly opportunistic as you note. There are things we bought that have been in lease up. We're pursuing a transaction today that is in -- still under construction. So there might be some opportunities for us to sort of play here and there. But, I guess I'll tell you, Dave, that there's nothing out there that we need to buy. There's nothing out there that's hugely strategically important for us. And if we can find the right trade opportunity, the right things to buy, at the time we believe we're getting good value on what we want to sell, we'll transact. But if we can find that's, we won't. David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And we noticed a pretty big increase in CapEx in the quarter on a year-to-date basis. You're up pretty meaningfully year-over-year. Can you talk about that and what the expectations are for 2015? Mark J. Parrell: Sure. It's Mark Parrell. I think for '14, we'll be pretty close to that $1,700 number. Dave, we increased our [indiscernible] spend guidance a little bit. We are doing rehab at a faster pace, and we have teams working really hard and doing some good work for us. And building improvements probably a little lower. But that's just timing, that's just projects moving between the years. I would think next year will be similar to $1,700 number, which again, we think about also as a percentage of rent. So this new portfolio has obviously, much higher rents, much higher per unit values. And so we think the CapEx spend really matches up with that pretty well. And in terms of the changes from last year, last year's numbers didn't include the Archstone spend to the same store set. So the numbers you are comparing are a bit apples and oranges. David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : Right. So you're spending significantly more on the Archstone assets, legacy assets? David J. Neithercut: Well, we're spending significantly more, I would say, on assets in general because we have these higher cost assets in higher cost markets. The Archstone projects or deals are getting a little more attention. But for example, rehabs were 2/3 EQR legacy properties and 1/3 Archstone legacy property. So that's about the right split between the portfolio NOI. David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : Okay, great. And the last question on that, what's the contribution that you've seen in 2014 to NOI growth from this activity? What do you expect in 2015? David J. Neithercut: So again, we do leave our rehabs in same store because as a percentage of the value of the assets are pretty small. We do know others take rehabs in and out. And that's just not something we do, we leave them in. But it's still pretty modest as you look at the whole portfolio. So something on the order this year of 15 basis points would be the contribution year-to-date. That would be our expectations going forward, 10 to 20 basis points, Dave. David J. Neithercut: Now I guess, the only other thing I'd add there is we're averaging 12 -- $10,000, $12,000 per unit spend and all those ideas of rehabs that can be $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 per unit. So it's a little different activity that we're conducting than what we understand in some of our peers might [indiscernible]. Mark J. Parrell: And just to finish that thought. I mean, the Breakwater, the Marina del Rey deal at Breakwater, which is looking on our development page, that was $100,000-plus unit rehab. It was an empty property we emptied out. That isn't the same store and never was. These other rehabs are often done when occupied. It means for us, it's appropriate to keep those sort of rehabs in same-store, and to take these big major rehabs out. Operator : Our next question comes from Jana Galan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : A question for David Santee, if you could please provide a update of rent as a percent of income and maybe highlight some of the markets like San Francisco that saw 12.5% year-over-year growth? David S. Santee: Well, I think, we've kind of discussed this before in that we measure income one time when folks move in. And because we use the same qualifiers, I mean that percent of income really never changes. So when we look at San Francisco today, the median rent percent of meeting income is 24%; Southern California, 23%; Seattle is only 19%. So the numbers really don't change as people with higher incomes continue to backfill the people that move out because they can't afford the rent. Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : And you mentioned move out for homeownership were down about 90 bps. Can you provide steps and other reasons to move out? David S. Santee: Yes, I mean, year in and year out, the #1 reason is really job change. Either people need to relocate or transferring, what have you, that always runs kind of in the 23% to 24% of move outs. Rent increases, too expensive, those have been really -- when you look back at the last 7 or 8 quarters, it's been 12% to 13%. Obviously, some markets are more dramatic than others. There for a while, San Francisco was 30%, 33% of move outs. And then bought home is typically the third. So as far as the overall makeup of move out. It's still pretty consistent with job change #1, increase to expenses #2 and then bought a home #3. Operator : We'll go next to Rich Anderson from Mizuho Securities. Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division : So when you were thinking about your outlook for same-store revenue, it's 50 basis points higher this year than it was last year. And I'm curious what kind of were you thinking then versus now? Is it a rehab impact as Mark described? Or is there something more optimistic that you feel about for 2015 versus starting point last year? David S. Santee: Well, I would first say that we kind of build this from the ground up. We start with embedded rent. So we start with the projected value of the rent roll in Q4. We look at turnover and know that in a lot of these markets we have below 50% turnovers. So you can pretty much count on the renewal increases to come through for you. And then it's just a matter of what you think rents are going to grow next year in the markets. I would say that we definitely have a higher degree of confidence in the Southern California markets to produce greater growth than we've seen in the past. I think we're probably a little more optimistic on D.C. than we were last year. That's not to say that DC is going to make some big turnaround. But certainly, it performed better than we thought. This year, we're just kind of taking the same assumption next year. When you put all that into the blender, that's how we get our range. Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division : Okay. You mentioned, David, that the new supply happening in Florida, Southern Florida. On the topic of fine-tuning from a transaction and kind of portfolio pruning perspective, will Florida now kind of register in the market where you start to get in front of what could be some supply pressure in the next couple of years? David J. Neithercut: Really, the focus will continue to be on the exit markets that we've been working on. And we've got, I think, desires to sell more kind of older noncore assets in some of our core markets. But no market is immune or off-limits from selling asset, we think we can trade those dollars into better performing other assets. But the focus will be on Inland Empire continuing in Orlando. Some far out in Western Massachusetts' assets, some maybe some suburban stuff in D.C., Inland Empire. I think the priorities will likely be there. Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then my last question, do you have a statistics on the percentage of your tenants that are married? David J. Neithercut: What we know is that nearly half of our units are occupied by single individuals. We know -- and units are occupied by 2 adults. We don't always know what marital status is. Operator : We'll go next to David Toti from Cantor Fitzgerald. David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : Just quickly, David, I want to go back to the emphasis on the urban renter and the urban product that the company has been focusing on for some time. We hear from some peers that actually they're concerned about urban locations given generally higher levels of supply delivery, and there seems to be a focus from some of your peers to be on more suburban assets. Could you maybe just comment on -- do you believe that's through that risk of supply is higher? And is there any way that you cut the portfolio performance relative to urban versus suburban if you looked at that on a go forward basis? David J. Neithercut: We're certainly aware of what elevated deliveries have been maybe in D.C. and in Boston up in these urban markets. That doesn't change our long-term view that these are the best long-term performers, and will provide us with a higher long-term total rate of return. This increased density bring more people, brings more activity, supports more restaurants, more bars. I mean, it is very much a lotus of the lifestyle that we believe that our demographic would prefer. I think that these young people want to be downtown, they don't want to be in the suburbs. And I'm not suggesting that you can't build and lease units in the suburbs. We just -- we think that the impact, the long-term impact will be greater being downtown, notwithstanding some, what we believe are short-term elevated levels of deliveries in some of these markets. We think that the peak is here or nearly 2015. It will come down from there. The absorption that we've seen, for instance, in D.C., I think continues to give us confidence that this is where people want to be, and it will pay off for us over the long term. David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : Does it suggest then that perhaps, the suburban renter, if you're going to really aggregate that individual is older, perhaps married? And maybe a little bit less elastic in terms of rent and price tolerance? David J. Neithercut: I guess, I think one can make assumptions like that. We've not done any real hard diligence on that. I guess my sense is, my personal sense is people that are renting in the suburbs want to be in the suburbs and likely be homeowners in the suburbs. And people that are renting downtown want to be downtown, and it will be long time before they're homeowners in the suburbs. David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : Okay. I'm just trying to explore that, that sort of theory a little bit. Just one last question on the development pipeline. For the recent projects, are you seeing -- are you basically underwriting significantly lower yield expectations on these assets? Or has the yield generally remained pretty steady and maybe some -- if you just can quantify that to some extent, that would be helpful. David J. Neithercut: I mean, as we -- as we're underwriting new deals? David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division : Yes. David J. Neithercut: Yes, well, certainly, yields have come down. So, I mean, the product that we built in 2010, 2011 that is now sort of stabilized, they're stabilizing in the high 7s and the 8s. That product and lease-up today, which would've been started a couple of years ago are probably in the mid-6s. Things that are being completed soon will kind of be high 5s, low 6s. So clearly as construction prices have increased and land prices have increased, yields have certainly come down. And as I say, the things we're starting today, we think are low 5s to 6. So you're certainly getting better returns on that, which you started coming out of the recession, if you have had land priced at what you could buy at the recession. If you were carrying legacy land, you wouldn't be able to realize those same returns. But certainly, you're getting lower returns today than you were putting projects in service 4 years ago. Operator : We'll take our next question from Nick Yulico from UBS. Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : A couple of questions. Going back to the preliminary talk about expenses next year. I think you said, Dave, modestly higher than 2014. I wasn't sure if that related to the modestly higher than the 2.2% growth level this year. David S. Santee: Yes. Modestly elevated compared to the 2.2%. Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. And then turning to New York City portfolio. Can you remind us, I think, some of your assets there have 421 abatements, which will eventually be rolling off at some point. If you remind us how many of those assets have those and when those abatements might roll off? And how are you thinking about that process in relation to maybe looking at those assets as being good candidates for condo conversion, sales not doing it yourself. David J. Neithercut: Well, I don't know off the top of my head how many are subject to 421A. But there are fair number of them. And they are all in many of them in the process of burning off, because they do burn off over an extended time period. And the impact on real estate taxes next year because of 421A burn off is what, David? David S. Santee: That's 160 basis points. David J. Neithercut: So significant percent share of our increase in real estate taxes next year is a result of the burn off of the 421A. And then your second question with respect to interest in kind of medium conversions of our properties, we're open-minded about selling things in New York city if people will pay us premiums for them. Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. But I mean, you're not at the point now where you've identified several of these assets that you're going to be facing higher real estate taxes and you're thinking about bringing those to market to sell. David J. Neithercut: There's no such activity underway at the present time. David S. Santee: We have quite a number of 421A assets. Just sitting here, looking at the percent of tax, it could be 30% to 40% of our assets in New York. But we have -- because there's step-ups every 5 years or what have you over 15 or 20 years, we're experiencing step-ups pretty much every year to varying degrees. Operator : We'll go next to Alex Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : Two questions. One, what is your take for why we're seeing apartment fundamentals accelerating? I mean, if you look at the economy, it generally seems to be following the same trend. It's not like the economy has suddenly shot off the roof and job growth is through the roof, et cetera. And this supply picture hasn't dramatically just dropped. So why do you think that we're getting a sort of acceleration of apartment fundamentals when one would think that you'd sort of get maturation of the cycle? David J. Neithercut: I think it just been a slow and steady improvement. I think that we've sort of seen this over the past 3, 4 years. It's just been slow and steady improvement. We're starting to create jobs and employment rate is coming down slowly, but surely. We'll get some economic activity happening. And the demographic picture is not impacted really, by what's happening in the economy. So there are still 4 million young people a year turning 21 years of age in this country. I mean, in formal households and we're seeing a lot of them move to the city. So I think it's just been a slow and steady process. And frankly, don't forget that we've under built housing in this country over the past half a dozen years. We certainly didn't deliver a lot of product in '09, in 2010. And so I think we're still behind, frankly, I think what a normal level of new supply might be. So I think those things all add up to just continued slow and steady fundamentals in the business that continued to look really good for us. Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : So last year where we sort of had a pause in the second half of the year, so you wouldn't -- would you attribute that more towards sort of renter adjustments to the new levels? And now that everyone has accepted the new rents, it's just moving on? Or should we -- are you think that maybe next year, we see some perspective some of the increases we've seen this year? David J. Neithercut: I guess I don't really have an opinion about that, Alex, I'm sorry. Again, David just mentioned we get through the highest occupancy, we ever had this time of the year. Our left to lease is low. So just basic fundamentals are good. I will tell you we get pushed back all the time from people about rental increases. Many of whom go out, shop the market, come back and accept the renewal offer. Others can't, as David noted the second biggest reason people move out is they can't afford it. But we've got people who will -- are happy to move back in, who move in with a higher income of the person that left. So again, I just think it's kind of a slow and steady event. I think that the interest in owning single-family homes is not there of our tenant profile. Again, nearly being half of our units occupied by single individuals. For those who might like to own a single-family home, down payments are stretched and getting financing is difficult. So I think all of those things add up to just continued slow and steady improvement in fundamentals and just a very positive outlook for us. Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : Okay. Second question is given how the tenures come down and the demand for especially CBD real estate just seems to continued increase. Are you guys seeing more demand from institutions to own infill CBD apartments? Or are the cap rates still top for pension funds to digest? David J. Neithercut: Well, I guess I'd say that cap rates relative to the 10-year treasury might be as positive and as wide as they've been in quite some time. We're still seeing interest in institutions owing these kind of assets. And a deal just traded in Seattle a half a block away from the deal that we're now building on Pine Street that traded like 3.5, and they're happy to have it. And they think they might acknowledge, there might be a 5% IRR up, but 10-year treasury level today, that's -- they think that's a very acceptable spread. I guess what I'd say is, there may be fewer of those institutions chasing those deals today. But there's still enough of them to get done at very, very strong pricing. David S. Santee: And, Alex, that you were right last week. There's a lot of discussion, pardon me about foreign buyers and their interest in multifamily in these markets that they find these sort of core markets highly desirable. They like the return, they like it as a safety play and that folks across the country are seeing some added interest from foreign buyers that really weren't that common as buyers of multifamily in the past. Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : And that is a shift. Operator : We'll take our next question from Vahid Khorsand from BWS Financial. Vahid Khorsand - BWS Financial Inc.: Quickly on the fundamentals, when the federal government came out last week and was talking about reducing the standards and making it easier for people to get home loans. How you see that impacting you going forward if that is instituted? David J. Neithercut: Well, I guess if I own a lot of property in the lands in Phoenix, Dallas, I might be concerned about that. But we just don't see that as a risk to us. We, again, as I've said several times, it's a very large share of our units occupied by single individuals, a very smaller share, less than 10% are occupied by 2 adults with children. And it's also, I want to just impress upon you, it's a lifestyle choice. That not simply an economic decision. I think our residents want to live in high-density environments with proximity to public transportation, et cetera, and all the things one enjoys. I guess I'd ask everybody on the phone how many young analysts are now coming in your office, saying they're moving to suburbs because they didn't get a 93% -- 97% single-family home loan. They're not because they want to live downtown, they want to buy -- live near their friends, they want to live near where all the activity is. And I also suggest few that they really do value this flexibility of being a rental housing. I mean, just today, this morning, I got an email from my nephew in Phoenix talking about he think he might be taking a new job here in Chicago. I mean, this is a mobile segment of the population that at least at this time in their lives are not interested in single-family homeownership. We are also in markets today, where the cost of that -- those single-family homes as a multiple of incomes is significantly higher than the national average. So I would think that single-family home REITs and those who operate in lower cost markets would be more at risk of what their residents might do as a result of been able to get very expensive 97% loan value single-family mortgages. Vahid Khorsand - BWS Financial Inc.: Okay. In the last quarter, you announced that you picked up in property in Glendale, and this quarter, you announced a property in North Hollywood and then a partial purchase in L.A. And I think it was 1 month or 2 months ago, you actually came out with a report that said they expect rents across Los Angeles to go up 8%. Do you see that actually happening? Is that too low an estimate for you? Can you give any thoughts on that? David J. Neithercut: So I guess we won't give you any specificity about Southern California except to say that in David's earlier remarks, he noted that it was a very strong performing market this year and expected it to be a strong [indiscernible] market for us next year. So long term, we like Southern California, and are delighted with what we own and with the recent investments that we've made there. Vahid Khorsand - BWS Financial Inc.: So if I could ask you then, do you have any impression from investors that there's a little bit of West Coast bias when it comes to your California properties because they have been surpassing growth expectation -- targets and no one seems to be taking that much notice of them? David J. Neithercut: I'm not sure I understand the question. Certainly, Seattle and San Francisco have been some of the top-performing markets and we think David suggested that L.A., Southern California in it's top bucket. Joining those in the top buckets, so certainly the West Coast is expected to have better top line growth next year than the East Coast. Vahid Khorsand - BWS Financial Inc.: Okay. And I guess and last question, for the property purchase, you said there was up 4.7% cap rate. Is that the stabilized cap rate? Or could you provide us with the stabilized cap rate? David J. Neithercut: Well, that is -- it would be a stabilized cap rate, so there's still a little bit of lease up going on in that transaction, that would be a stabilized cap rate. Operator : We'll take our next question from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. George Hoglund - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : This is George on for Tayo. Most of my questions have been answered. But one thing when you talked about the increased turnover, it's mainly -- or the increases within the portfolio people moving to larger, more expensive units. Do you have any color on sort of what's the driver of that? Are these people who are making more money who want a nicer apartment? Or are these people who may be coupling up and instead of moving out to home, they're just getting a bigger apartment? David J. Neithercut: We don't have that level of detail. I would suggest that it's probably all of the above. We know that if people get a promotion, they want to move up 10 floors and have a better view. And some people, who want to pair up with a roommate. There is no difference as bonuses don't come in as large that if somebody might have to downsize. But nevertheless, they still want to remain in the neighborhood, they want to be around the lifestyle that they have accustomed to. And I think they're willing to make whatever adjustments they need to accomplish that. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets. Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : David, if you mind just going back to the changes in the quarter. Obviously, you said a 6% renewal increase, was that -- that was -- what was the new lease on a lease-over-lease basis? And how is that blended actual change in the quarter? Just trying to compare that to the second quarter acceleration that you saw. Mark J. Parrell: Okay, the lease-over-lease was 2.3 lease. Renewal was 6 and blended 4. Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay, so the blended change lease-over-lease was 4 in the quarter. Okay, that's helpful. Then, David, second question, just going back to, I think David Bragg's question, you talked about the acquisition opportunities. Just given the challenging acquisition environment, I think you said the $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion between '14 and '15. Is there any thoughts to maybe push forward a little bit more development surge into '15? Or you still comfortable with that kind of a $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion range? David J. Neithercut: Well, I guess we're comfortable with what we talked about development being peaking this year and next year, and then kind of going back down. It's -- land sites are very expensive, construction costs are up. In places like New York City, San Francisco, you can't touch property given the strength, the strong bid from the condo builder. I guess, I mean, our instructions to our development team is we'll find a way to do whatever good development projects we can find. In New York city, for instance, that might be having to be done on ground leases as opposed to free simple. Or just finding other opportunities. And I guess I want to just emphasize sort of the word opportunities. I mean to us that means find things that we believe we can buy relatively cheap. And that's the challenge today, the guys who are working very hard bulk from the transaction group and the development group, they're trying find things that are really value creation opportunities. But it's a challenge given that the strong bid for land today, primarily from condo guys as well as the strong bid for stabilized streams of income that we're seeing from institutional buyers and the foreign buyers that Mark mentioned. Operator : We'll go next to Nick Joseph from Citi. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : It's actually Michael Bilerman. Just 2 quick questions. David Santee, do you know when you talk about the intra-asset movement, which is to press the turnover stats you showed. Do you have, I guess going back on an annual basis, how many of your residents moved either intra-asset and then intra-equity because in addition to some of the reasons you cite, I assume you as a landlord and how you treat your residence and what you're offering in your buildings and how the more urban nature of your portfolio likely means more shifts within the portfolio to an equity-owned building. And I said [indiscernible] numbers to support that thesis. David S. Santee: Yes, we measure that. We've been measuring it for the last 7 or 8 years. It's, on average, it's about 500 residents per quarter that moved, that stayed within the Equity family. Sometimes, that's just a result of how we structured the ledgers on a building, Trump is the best example where each building is a separate entity, so to speak. So therefore, it's not a transfer, it's a move out, move in. But for the most part, we track the number of people that move from what market to what market. And for the most part, it's loyal customers that want to stay within the Equity family because they've enjoyed their living experience thus far. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : And I guess with the increase in sort of mobility of the millennials, are you going after that more as people, if they do put up a notice of -- that they're vacating that, if they're moving to a different location, trying to get them to put Equity on the map. So if they're moving -- Neithercut talked about his nephew moving to Chicago, recognizing there's not a lot of downtown spike, but would you be able to work with that? David S. Santee: Yes, we actually have a 1 (800) number specifically designed for that, that we have people in our call center that are referred to as relocation specialists. We recently, well, kind of, call it, back in May, we revised our transfer guidelines cost and we just made it more desirable from both an economic and ease of transfer for residence. And I think one, that's why we seen elevated transfers over the last quarter. But also, we're seeing more and more people stay within the Equity family. So we constantly look for ways to improve that experience and retain residence for a longer period. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Great. And then just a question for Neithercut. On the day [indiscernible] rate comes out at 64.4%, which I think is the lowest since early '95. Sam's on record saying, you think this is going to 55%. Can you just provide some color if that's the mindset, why Sam would sell share 2 million shares of EQR in August, $130 million? David J. Neithercut: Well, it's not my place to explain what Sam has done, except to tell you that those in the first shares of Equity Residential stock Sam has sold in 23 years. And that they were done for some estate planning purposes. And we've been assured that, that's the end of it. So I think that this was last of call of homeownership, et cetera, and more just some personal financial things that needed to be taken care of. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Right. I guess as I think about EQR as an estate vehicle itself, if you believe that we are moving down to a 55% homeownership level, then we'll see continued growth in underlying cash flows, and hence, what will be dividend growth given the way you've tracked your dividend relative to free cash flow, it would just seem in congress to that sort of comment. So that's what I was trying to understand. David J. Neithercut: I think the residual ownership interest that Sam has in Equity Residential speaks volumes about his long-term feelings about the company. Operator : We'll go next to Buck Horne from Raymond James & Associates. Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : I just had a couple of questions. One, seems some time demographically talking about the millennial, but think about the other end of the spectrum right now, are you seeing any increases from baby boomers? And maybe the median age of your new renters, are you seeing any kind of empty nest renters looking for the downtown lifestyle right now? David S. Santee: Yes. When we look at our average age in Manhattan, the average age in Manhattan is 40 years old. So we see these numbers pickup little by little. We've done some studies where we look at where people have moved out of some of our suburban communities, where they've relocated to. And you kind of see some minor directional hints that people are moving into the city. And one of the reasons -- when you think about -- I think about our own folks in Washington, D.C. We had our office in the suburbs, out in Tyson's corner, we moved our office right downtown DC. If you live in the burbs, even though you have public transportation subway, it's just not fully built out yet, and it could take you 3 hours to get from, call it, Fairfax into the city. So I think that's a big consideration as well, as companies continue to move their offices into the city, people don't want to deal with the traffic, so they move into the city as well and you have this outsized demand for in-town property. Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : And moving to South Florida, I just want to go back to South Florida for a second. Do you have any station between the deliveries you are seeing coming next year between how many are for-sale condos versus pure rental apartments? And maybe what kind of cap rates are we seeing in South Florida right now, both for in place asset and development deals? David S. Santee: Well, the numbers that I quoted were for rent apartments. We build these from the ground up, a lot of people in the field validate and what have you certainly some of these could change. But David? David J. Neithercut: Yes, I think that the good quality product in South Florida will trade at 4.5% to 5.5% cap rates today. And as demonstrated by some of the product we've been selling, so the older garden product stuff is probably close to 6%. Operator : And at this time, we have no further questions in the phone queue. David J. Neithercut: All right. Thank you. I appreciative everybody's time today. We look forward to seeing many of you in Atlanta next week. Have a great day. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to today's speakers. Please go ahead. Marty McKenna : Thanks Noah. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's fourth quarter 2014 results and outlook for 2015. Our featured speakers today are, David Neithercut, our President and CEO; David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer and Mark Parrell, our Chief Financial Officer. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. And now I'll turn it over to David Neithercut. David Neithercut : Thanks Marty. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. As reported in last night's earning release, 2014 was another very good year for Equity Residential. Full year normalized FFO grew to $3.17 per share, an 11.2% increase over 2013 and amongst the highest year-over-year increases in our history. Clearly we continue to enjoy very strong public demand across our core markets. Much of this demand is generated from the creation of new households. Now like many we think that last week's report on fourth quarter household formations overstays what actually happened in the quarter. It was more likely an indication of the strong household growth that has been taking place through the entire year which has driven demand for good quality rental housing like that owned by EQR in our core markets across the country. We also benefit from the continued decline in single family home ownership rates across the country that was also reported last week. Now it remains to be seen if returned in a long term historical average of 64% becomes a bottom or not. But across our portfolio, we continue to see fewer residents leave us to buy a home either due to the lack of desire to actually own one or the financial inability to do so. All-in-all, multi-family fundamentals remain very strong and we continue to see no end in sight for above trend operating performance. Like last year when we saw same-store revenue growth 4.3% which exceeded not only our original expectations, but even our most recent ones due enlarge part to a very strong fourth quarter that delivered exceptional revenue growth of 4.9%. You may recall David Santee saying on our most recent call that if the sight we were seeing early in the fourth quarter continued, that we could beat our revenue estimates for the quarter and the results speak for themselves. And I want to acknowledge the great work of our team's across the country that delivered such terrific results last quarter and last year. And we're pleased to report the very strong performance these teams delivered in the fourth quarter of last year has carried over into the first quarter of 2015, which has given us confidence that the low end of the same-store revenue growth guidance range we gave you in late October is no longer in the cards. So with that said, I\u2019ll let David Santee give you a little bit more color on what we\u2019re seeing across the markets today. David Santee : Thank you David, and good morning everyone. Today I\u2019ll review our fourth quarter operating results, provide some additional color on our revised 2015 revenue guidance, detail out our 2015 expense outlook, and then end my remarks with brief updates across our core markets. On our Q3 call, I said that if elevated demand and subsequent occupancy continued through November and December, that we would exceed or we could exceed the 4.1% full year revenue growth target and that's exactly what happened. Occupancy increased quarter-over-quarter by 60 basis points. However, many of our higher average rent markets like LA, Seattle, New York, Orange County, San Diego, realized 80 basis points of increase, while San Francisco led the way delivering over 140 basis points of increased occupancy versus the same period last year. December, typically the lowest point of the year, was a solid 100 basis points higher than the previous year. Even Washington DC delivered 30 basis points of improved occupancy. Now while demand certainly picked up during mid-year as a result of improving job growth, many of our internal initiatives provided an even stronger foundation and position of strength in Q4. Typically, our softest quarter of the year, we reported turnover for the quarter increased by 1.6% or 194 units. However, the real story lies in resident retention netting out a 23% increase to same property transfers. During Q4, resident turnover decreased 50 basis points with more than 60% of these transfers electing for larger or more expensive units. For full year, resident turnover adjusted for same and inter property transfers declined 160 basis points from 48.9% to 47.3%. With the scale and variety of living options we offer across all of our core markets, it's clear that we are developing a strong following with our existing residents and delivering on our internal brand commitment. We also made tremendous progress in our day-to-day management of lease expirations . Our pricing teams worked diligently to integrate and better organize the Archstone portfolio explorations, while fine tuning legacy assets to account for close proximity of these competing assets. Today, the combined portfolios position for optimal seasonal performance, and we are seeing that play out in Q1 across all key drivers of revenue growth. Strong demand coupled with a successful execution of our internal initiatives created a Q4 environment that allowed us to perform just as strong in Q4 as we did in Q2 and Q3 with both new lease based rent and achieved renewal rent growth holding strong in the upper 5% range. More importantly, the strong drivers of revenue have carried through to Q1. Today, we continue to see occupancy that is 100 basis points higher than same week last year and exposure that is 100 basis points lower allowing for both renewal and new lease rates to accelerate versus a slow and steady climb from a much lower seasonal starting point. Renewals achieved in Q4 were 5.7%, although 20 basis points lower than Q3 based on normal seasonal expectations, it did average 25 basis points higher than Q1 and Q2 of 2014. January renewals bounced back to 5.9% achieved and February and March should easily exceed 6%. Given this trend, which is the material departure from our historical seasonal norms, we would expect Q1 revenue growth to almost near, if not exceed Q4, driven primarily by the 100 basis points of improved occupancy that we enjoy today and higher new lease rents. As we move closer to the peak leasing season, we would anticipate the favorable occupancy spreads to compress as we are mindful that 2015 deliveries remain elevated across many of our markets with occupancy always peaking during this period. For all the above reasons, we are comfortable with tightening our full year revenue guidance, increasing the bottom end of our previous range to 3.75%. Expenses for the quarter were extremely favorable at 2.2%, allowing us to achieve full year results that were 40 basis points below our stated expectation of 2.2% on the Q3 call. During our Q4 call last year, we said that we would mitigate the impact of real estate tax growth of 5.25% and a 7.5% expected utility expense growth by leveraging the integration of the Archstone portfolio through the reengineering of our leasing and advertising costs, onsite payroll, and a more efficient management company, and we did just that. For full year 2015, which accounts for 97,911 units, L&A costs declined 10.5%, onsite payroll was down 20 basis points, and property management costs declined by 5.2% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, we received a modest benefit from declining energy prices, as well as a year-end favorable accrual to employee overheads. For 2015, expense guidance is 2.5% to 3.5%. Real estate taxes, payroll, and utilities now account for almost 72% of total operating expense. With a complete reversal in energy, we would expect full year utility costs to be negative. That will help offset another five plus handle for real estate taxes which account for 36% of total expense. With an improving labor market and property staffing fully optimized, we anticipate total payroll costs to grow 2% to 3% for the full year, with all other line items in the 2.5% to 3.5% range. Now moving on to the markets. We'll start with Washington DC metro, which has seen record absorption in spite of anemic job growth during 2014. Despite another 13,000 units to be delivered this year and the tail end of 2014 deliveries in various stages of lease-up, the metro area remains very stable with solid occupancy and good pricing discipline. The district itself continues to see outsized population growth and 25% of our district move-ins were from folks moving closer in from Virginia and Maryland. With the budget deficit improving and many government retirees being replaced with younger workers with a higher propensity to rent, our positive year-over-year revenue growth that we see today and I'm not prepared to call a bottom, but it sure feels like we could be there. Assuming no change in direction, we're cautiously optimistic that DC could end the year flat to positive. Seattle will be measured by degrees of grade by submarket for 2015. The CBD Bellevue submarket will see a 30% decline in deliveries from 3200 to 2000. Capitol Hill and Redmond will experience similar levels of delivery although these deliveries are small in unit count and easier to digest. South Lake Union the geographical center of Seattle and home for Amazon, has been master planned to meet the transportation, recreation, and sustainable living needs for up to 50,000 jobs in this neighborhood area. And we expect this submarket to do extremely well next year and in future years. Bellevue on the other hand with the elevated deliveries with large unit counts that can weigh on performance for longer periods. With those operators in Snohomish, Everett and all other markets north, 2015 should yield above average results. With 2015 deliveries equal to 2014 and based on the location of those deliveries, we would expect Seattle to produce another year of outsized results. San Francisco continues with epic pace with significant acceleration in Q4. In one of the most under housed cities in the country, deliveries are miniscule and simply don\u2019t seem to be relevant. With January occupancy up 250 basis points versus 2014, at 97.2% today, and net effected base rent up 13% since in last January, it\u2019s easy to envision another year of 8% to 10% revenue growth for full year 2015. Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego continue to show signs and strength with Orange County expecting to produce the better revenue growth of the three, on fewer deliveries and quality job growth. Now Orange County can deliver a six plus percent revenue growth then I would expect LA and San Diego to trail by 50 basis points based on elevated deliveries alone. Broad based job growth across all markets and resolution of court of Los Angeles labor dispute are all positives in addition to the expanding Silicon Beach movement, and West LA down to Playa Del Rey. If there is a market that will benefit from lower gasoline costs, it will certainly be SoCal, and we would expect to see the spreads tightened between ask and achieved renewal rents over the course of the year. Jumping over to Boston, a glut of high end deliveries in the urban core and the financial district is beginning to weigh on this submarket and subsequently our portfolio. With a 35% increase in delivered units for 2015, net affected base rents remain flat, however occupancy is stable and demand remains solid. With such large concentrations of high end product within a very small radius we would expect pricing pressure throughout much of 2015. New York City specifically Manhattan remains stable with only slight concentrations of new deliveries on the upper west side. Jersey City and Brooklyn will both deliver large institutional type product, which will weigh on pricing power over the next year. However with population in the metro achieving the new high of 8.4 million people, a pick up in business and professional service jobs and the continued growth in jobs away from financial services, New York should produce four-handle revenue growth supported by an expected 155,000 new jobs in 2015. As we discussed last call, South Florida claims continue to grow like weeds with over 12,000 condos in various stages of development. Concentrations of the apartment deliveries were mainly in the Miami Brickell submarkets with most deliveries in Broward and Palm Beach being east of 95 that will demand a much higher price point versus the EQR portfolio.  With the Cuban thaw and growing South American business influence, we expect South Florida to have an exceptionally strong year. Revisiting our three buckets of revenue growth, we still see San Francisco, Seattle, Denver and Orange County in our plus 5% revenue growth bucket. New York, LA, San Diego and South Florida remain in the 3% to 5% revenue bucket. However Boston will do well to achieve 3%, but today looks more or like a high 2%. Washington DC at 18% of NOY remains in its own bucket and as I said earlier we are cautiously optimistic that we could potentially end the year in flat for positive territory. I too would like to thank everyone across EQR for delivering on our commitment to both our residents and shareholders and look forward to another fantastic year at EQR. David? David Neithercut : All right, thanks, David. On the transaction side as expected we did nearly 63% of our full year disposition activity in the fourth quarter for the sale of seven properties containing nearly 2200 units for $332 million. Five of these assets were in Orlando, which left us with only three properties at the end the year that should all be sold in the first half of 2015. We also disposed of a small property in southern California and recently completed and stabilized unconsolidated Arch stone asset in Phoenix owned in a joint venture with a local developer. We acquired two stabilized assets in the fourth quarter both in Seattle at a blended cap rate of 4.8% and our partner\u2019s 95% interest and is; soon to be completed project currently in lease up in Emeryville California at a stabilized yield for 4.8%. Now as noted in last nights release for the full year acquisitions totaled $557 million so that includes all the stabilized assets, properties of lease up and the one owned in a joint venture and dispositions total nearly $530 million, which includes the one held in a joint venture, and that was all done in a cap rate spread of about 113 basis points. Now as indicated on page 27 of the supplements and materials in last night\u2019s press release, our guidance for 2015 assumes a similar level of activity at 100 basis point spread. Now we continue to have assets that we would like to sell, but we are in no rush to do so. So, if we can source good acquisition opportunities relative to the assets we\u2019d like to sell, we\u2019ll go ahead and make that trade. Now at the present time there is product available for sale in our core markets that we would be pleased on, but the wall of capital anxious to acquire those assets remain significant, pushing cap rates down and pricing up the levels that will likely leave us on the sidelines. But, like last year I'm sure we will find some investment opportunities either sourced directly or with risks that we can uniquely underwrite and manage that will enable us to sell some assets and redeploy that capital into our core markets that will provide us better long term risk adjusted returns. On the development side we are excited to commence construction on two assets in the fourth quarter, one is in Seattle\u2019s Salt Lake Union submarket where we are building 483 units for $159 million at an expected yield at today\u2019s rents in the upper fives, and one fronting show place square in San Francisco\u2019s, Soma district where we are building 241 units for $164 million, at an expected yield of today's rents in the mid fives. Fourth quarter starts about the full year to $1.15 billion the highest level of starts in our history that will soon deliver as great product in Southern California, San Francisco and Seattle at weighted average initial yields at current rents for the mid fours to nearly 6%. We also completed $491 million of development projects in 2014 and we currently expect these new assets that deliver low 6% returns on current rents in markets where core product today trades in the fours such as downtown LA, Seattle and Pasadena. In 2015 we expect to complete $846 million of properties currently under development and 1.2 billion in 2016 and our current forecast are that these deliveries will generate initial yields of the mid fives to mid sixes at current rents, which includes new product in Southern California, San Francisco, San Jose and Seattle and two terrific new developments in New York City, which we will be very proud to show many of you during the June NAREIT meetings. We are not acquiring land for new development today at the rate we are commencing construction on existing sites held in inventory by definition then future starts should decrease from the record level we saw last year. So over the next two years we currently expect to start approximately $1 billion of new construction projects all on land currently held in inventory and at the present time expect to start $400 million of those projects this year and the balance in 2016 all of, which is self funded requiring no incremental equity capital to complete. So now, we will turn the call over to Mark Parrell who will take you through some important financial messages. Mark Parrell : Thank you, David. Good morning. I want to take a few minutes this morning to talk about our guidance for 2015 as well as our new commercial paper program and our 2015 sources and uses. For the year we have provided normalized FFO guidance range of $3.35 to $3.45 per share, at the mid point this equates to 7.25% growth in normalized FFO in 2015, and this is on top of the 11.2% growth we experienced in 2014, and that creates a compound average growth rate of normalized FFO of 9.25% per year. We also expect to grow our dividend substantially in 2015, raising it from its current level of $2 per share, up to $2.21 per share, which is a healthy 10.5% increase. So, I\u2019ll go through some quick highlights on our 2015, guidance, as David Santee, said, we expect continued growth in same store operations and that should add $0.21 per share or $81 million to our bottom-line. We see a $19 million or $0.5 per share contribution from our non-same store assets and that does include our leased up. And in addition, we\u2019ve seen $11 million or $0.3 penny per share, expected improvement from lower interest expense and that number is net of capitalized interest. The interest expense improvement comes from lower expected rates and higher expected capitalized interest, and that\u2019s offset a bit by slightly higher weighted average debt balance for the year. All those good benefits are offset by about $0.04 per share reduction in normalized FFO, and that\u2019s due to transaction activity timing, and to be clear, this is due to the timing of both 2014, and 2015, transactions. 2014, was benefited by the fact that acquisitions occurred mostly in the beginning of the year while as David Neithercut, noted, dispositions were mostly backend loaded. In contrast, 2015, is burdened by our expectation that we will complete the majority of our dispositions in the first half of the year, while acquisitions will be evenly spaced throughout 2015. I am now going to move on to G&A, we have bifurcated our treatment of this line item, our 2015, normalized FFO guidance anticipates our recurring G&A to be $51 million to $53 million, and that\u2019s slightly higher at the mid point than the $51 million in G&A that we reported in 2014. In addition, our GAAP G&A will include approximately $9.7 million in charges. We are incurring in 2015, in connection with the adoption of our new executive compensation program. We will also incur a GAAP charge of $1.3 million that will run through our property management line in connection with this program. This new performance based plan and it\u2019s pretty similar to those and many other REITs, covers the period 2015 to 2017. The old plan which used the time based vesting methodology terminated for executives at the end of 2014. The accounting rules require that both the time based grant for service in 2014, and the performance based grant for service from 2015 to 2017, both be expensed in 2015. This overlapping and duplicative GAAP charge of $11 million is not included in our normalized FFO guidance for G&A or property management, and one timing note on G&A, we again have many G&A costs that are frontend loaded, and we therefore expect that 60% of our G&A expend to happen during the first six months of the year. Now I want to take a moment to talk a bit about our new commercial paper program. This week we entered into $500 million commercial paper program, which will allow us to borrow daily, weekly, or monthly at extremely low floating rates of interest. This will allow us to continue to reduce our already very low cost of capital. I want to take a moment though to put the CP program into the context of our larger balance sheet management strategy, as we have discussed before, the company generally expects floating rate debt to constitute 15% to 20% of total debt. Our portion of this floating rate exposure comes from borrowings under our unsecured revolving line of credit. We expect to use the new CP program to replace a portion of the amount that we would otherwise have outstanding under our revolving line of credit. When fully implemented, we expect the CEP program to save us approximately 0.5% or 50 basis points as compared to our line pricing. We have amended our line of credit to ensure that it will be available in the event the commercial paper market is disrupted and we need to repay our CP borrowings on short notice. We are very pleased to be one of the few real estate companies, who through good balance sheet management have earned market and rating agencies support to do a CP program. Now I want to end with a little color on the sources and uses for 2015. We are very well positioned heading into the year. We expect to repay approximately $600 million of debt in 2015, which consist of $400 million that\u2019s listed on our maturity schedule as coming due in 2015 as well as about $200 million of high cost mortgage debt that\u2019s due in 2016 that we will be repaying in 2015. There are no pre-payment penalties associated with that. We will also spend about $700 million this year on development activities. So, on the aggregate we see about $1.3 billion of cash usage in 2015. Our guidance assumes we fund these uses with $950 million of debt consisting of a $500 million debt due in the first half of 2015 and a $450 million debt due in the second half of the year.  The remaining $350 million will mostly come from operating cash flow, and just the few other debt related guidance assumptions for you. We have about $450 million in hedges. They are locking an implied ten year treasury rate of approximately 2.5%. The issuance expected in the first half of the year. We expect to have about $59 million in capitalized interests in 2015. We expect to maintain an average balance on our revolving line of credit or under our new commercial paper program of about $400 million this year, and we anticipate ending the year with outstanding revolver borrowings and or commercial paper out standings of about $400 million and that is modestly higher where we began 2015. That will still leave us with $2 billion of capacity on our revolver that does not mature until 2018. And now I will turn the call back over to David Neithercut. David Neithercut : Thanks Mark. So before we open the call to questions, I just want to mention how pleased we all are here at Equity that Steve Sterrett was appointed to our Board last week  You all know what a smart experienced capable pro Steve is. We also know that just as importantly he\u2019s really a good guy. He\u2019s going to be a terrific add to what is already a very experienced and thoughtful group of people. The entire Board and the entire management team really look forward to working with Steve in the years ahead. So with that Noah, I will be happy to open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Nick Yulico with UBS. Nick Yulico : Hi, everyone. As I look at your same-store guidance, the high end of 2015 same-store NOI guidance is for growth of 5.5%, and that would roughly equal 2014. Can you talk a little bit about some of the biggest factors that get you there? Seems like demand trends are picking up, yet maybe occupancy comps are get tougher you cited through the year, and you still have some worries about supply in relation to that? David Santee : Well, I think it\u2019s just the - this is David Santee. I think you just have to kind of put all that in a blender and evaluate your risks on a market-by-market basis. Certainly, as I said in the prepared remarks, DC delivered quite a number of units last year. Many of those properties are still in the low teens or - well below 50% leased up, and you have another big crunch coming this year. So, I kind of talked about this last year that all roads lead to DC for us. Looking at it another way, if you pull DC out of our numbers, you would have seen a 120 basis point improvement on both Q4 revenue and full year revenue. So, I think we are very confident about our expectations across all the other markets, but DC being 20% or almost 20% of our NOI can materially move the meter either way. Nick Yulico : Okay. And then just as what we were hearing that in New York City, you may have been quietly testing sale of an asset to test the condo conversion market. Can you talk a little bit about whether you have been doing that and kind of your latest thoughts on your Manhattan portfolio in relation to possibly selling some assets at very low cap rates based on the strength in the market? David Santee : Well, I guess all I can say there Nick is that in the guidance we've given you $500 million of dispositions that does not include any sales of any assets in Manhattan. Nick Yulico : Okay. Anything as to whether you can confirm whether you were actually testing the market quietly to see how - ? David Santee : I'd tell you that we believe everything we own is for sale all the time. Nick Yulico : Okay. Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Nicholas Joseph : Thanks. David you mentioned the wall of capital chasing deals today, do you expect any impact from a stronger US dollar on foreign demand for U.S. multi-family assets and could that have any impact on cap rates going forward? David Neithercut : Well, I think that there certainly is demand from foreign capital, but there\u2019s also a lot of demand from domestic capital, but I think we\u2019ll continue to look at good quality, multi-family assets as a good investment opportunity. And there are frankly so few assets available for sale, I\u2019m not sure that that would negatively impact valuation. So, that\u2019s certainly an interesting thought, but I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s one that would negatively impact the demand for asset here. Nicholas Joseph : Thanks. And then in terms of development, you talked about not backfilling the pipeline as fast as the expected starts, but given the strong multi-family fundamentals and their runway for future growth, how does development fit into EQR's long-term strategy? David Neithercut : Well, it plays an important part in our long term strategy, but it\u2019s not the only part of our strategy. We continue to be very active and try and look for development opportunities and we\u2019ll continue to do so. But it\u2019s just - prices have gotten very expensive, construction costs are up, and we\u2019re just not seeing the opportunities to reload that inventory for same rate that we\u2019re putting it into service. And we\u2019ve got, could be opportunities to buy assets in markets, could be opportunities to buy land in markets, and we\u2019ll continue to pursue both and execute what we think are the best risk adjustment returns. Nicholas Joseph : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : And we'll take our next from Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors. Dave Bragg : Thank you. Good morning. David, can you elaborate on the competitive acquisition market that might leave you on the sidelines. Question is as acquisitions have gotten more competitive, to what extent has your cost of capital, namely disposition pricing not kept up the pace? David Neithercut : Well, I guess you\u2019ve not seen us print any of the big acquisitions that kind of have taken place across the country. Again it's limited, but there certainly have been some. And we\u2019ve tended to find little opportunities here and there that might be property that are in lease up or properties maybe even under development or just ones that have got different unique risks that we might be able to manage. In addition, we are having this opportunity to buy out our joint venture partner on the field in Emeryville. And as I said earlier, we don\u2019t have product that we need to sell. So we\u2019re not anxiously looking for almost anything in order to get out of stuff that we don\u2019t want to own. So we\u2019re just trying to be opportunistic and make trades that make sense. The sheer volume of transaction activity that you\u2019ve seen us experience even away from the Archstone transaction over the past half a dozen of years has come down considerably as we\u2019ve sort of achieved our objective of transforming the portfolio, and we\u2019re just now going to take a little bit more opportunistic approach to the investment side. Dave Bragg : Okay. And so you target a 100 basis point cap rate spread between acquisitions and dispositions, love to hear your thoughts on what that\u2019s the right spread and is it currently a bit wider than that today when you look across the board at the stuff you could sell and the opportunities that you are underwriting on acquisition front? David Neithercut : Well, that\u2019s obviously based on what we know, we\u2019d sell if we could find the right opportunities and what we think, we\u2019ll have to pay for those opportunities if we would have acquired some of the stuff that we looked at and underwrote,, but we didn\u2019t buy that spread probably would have been wider because a lot of stuff have traded in the threes. We believe we can manage that business as today at a 100 or so basis point, but we did that in last year with a 113 basis point. So the guidance is just we think we could do 500 and we think we\u2019ll do 500 on the [indiscernible] and on the sales who knows how it will actually end up, but that\u2019s just the assumptions are made and the guidance that Mark gave. Dave Bragg : Okay. And the last question is that the investment activity lately specially on the development front has been largely focused on the West coast and can you talk about in general terms as to the changes that you\u2019ve seen in terms of your underwriting of long term growth rates on the west coast versus east coast or total returns potential that seems to be steering you incrementally towards the west coast over the last couple of years away from the east coast. David Neithercut : Well I mean I guess it\u2019s, we found more land opportunities. Well one thing is that we acquired a bunch of assets in the Archstone spread so that was one reason why you see more on the west coast and additionally we found a great piece of property of 405 in LA. We continue to find some opportunities in Seattle and believe me the guys on the east coast have been working awfully hard to try and find opportunities there. Very challenging in New York, it\u2019s not impossible. We got a couple of land sites in Washington that we\u2019ll consider to start building on. We\u2019ve got a couple of sites in Boston that we may build on soon. It\u2019s probably taking a longer time in Boston for instance to really get the things that we\u2019ve got our eyes on actually to point where we can start construction, but I think most of the reason why we\u2019ve been more west coast focused is the fact that we\u2019ve got four land sites in San Francisco with Archstone. Dave Bragg : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jana Galan : Thank you. Good morning. Question for David Santee, I was wondering if you could touch on affordability in your markets, if you could share either the move-outs due to the rent increase in the fourth quarter or where your residents are as a percent with rent as percent of the income by market. David Santee : Well I think we've discussed this before this that currently we really only measure residents income at time of application so just by that nature they\u2019re going to be able to afford the rent and therefore as we\u2019ve seen in the over the years really, the rent as a percent of income really doesn\u2019t change. You just people making more money are replacing people that can\u2019t afford it. I will tell you we see a, in the area of move outs due to rent being too expensive that has fallen off significantly. I want to say probably 600 basis points for the year, but a lot of that was really centered in San Francisco that was the key drive, but even San Francisco has stabilized a lot more. David Neithercut : So historically, we\u2019ve seen rent as a percent of income to be about 20% so that's the way it\u2019s been not only in the existing portfolio, but in the portfolio that we owned in the 90\u2019s it\u2019s a fairly consistent percentage on an average. Jana Galan : Thank you and then I\u2019m just curious you have had very impressive high occupancy rates. I\u2019m curious if you think this is the results of kind of under supply of housing coming out of the recession or improvement from revenue management? David Santee : Well I guess I would say, that we\u2019ve never been once to buy occupancy and I think if you look back over the years relative to some of our competitors that we tend to probably run a little lower occupancy in Q4 because we try to optimizing that balance between rate and occupancy. This year we didn\u2019t pull any levels any differently than we have in previous years so this improved occupancy was really just a true function of increased demand and one could argue that in some of these markets. Look we said, over the past couple of years if you start sprinkling in more jobs that went from $150,000 a month, although we have to \u2013 you know, the high 2s that we could see upsized growth, and we\u2019ve discussion recently that you know, look, if things continue the way they are then 97% could be the new 95% occupied in a quality institutional type communities. Mark Parrell : So it\u2019s really a combination of lots of things, Jana. It\u2019s under supply of new product. It\u2019s people staying single longer. It\u2019s people interested in living in the high density urban environment. I mean, there\u2019s all sorts of things that come to play. And we\u2019ve been talking about for the past four or five years that are really now all coming. getting to a point, Jana, it have given us great occupancy, great revenue growth and a good outlook going forward. Jana Galan : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Ian Weissman with Credit Suisse. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys. This is Chris for Ian. I\u2019m just getting back to acquisitions and dispositions and the spreads there. I mean, I get that 100 basis points which you have forecasted for this year, but do we expect that number to come down in the future as the quality of assets that you\u2019re selling, improves, I guess, that\u2019s one. And then two, do you have an estimate in the terms of the spread on AFFO yield basis, because I imagine those are quite a bit tighter as the older assets are more CapEx intensive? David Neithercut : I think that that very possible, and also that the CapEx with the percentage revenue will be higher in the disposition at risk and the asset that we\u2019re selling. But that\u2019s a very good point and with respect to that cap rate spread and something that we are noticing. Having now essentially existed all of the more commodity like markets, much of what will be selling going forward are assets in our core markets that don\u2019t fit our need going forward. We got assets in suburban Seattle for instance. We\u2019ve got assets to some in New England. Some assets in California that we will be able to sell a cap rates that will be much tighter to those which we will be buying, but that\u2019s a very good point you raise. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Great. And then I guess I just wanted to revisit the 4Q beat. I guess you talked about the reason for it on the resident side and then just getting back to the expense side, I mean, you talk about the initiatives you put in place, I guess what surprised you after the 3Q call that led to you beating it by 40 basis points? Mark Parrell : Yes. It\u2019s Mark Parrell. I mean part of that certainly was some adjustments to reserves that we always do at the end of the year, and two of them in particular going in one direction and that was an adjustment or a medical reserve. So all year we spend Chris trying to estimate what our medical expenses will be for our employee benefit plans. And at the end of the year we drew that up and there was a couple of million dollar benefit from that that we were not anticipating. So that would have come through earlier in the year if we have approximated it correctly, because it is a savings, but we had over estimated the expense run rate for the year for our medical expense number. And then we had fewer casualties than we bought through the year and that also pushed some money through the system, that doesn\u2019t affect same store, that does affect FFO. But the medical reserve does affect same store and FFO. Unidentified Analyst : Got you. Thank you very much, guys. David Neithercut : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning. First question is, David, going back to the initial comments on the rent gap. In the first half you guys said its wide and that\u2019s why you expect the first half especially first quarter to be better than historic, but in the back half you spoke about it compressing and also the impacted supply up. If the first half continues is there upside to the back half or the back half assumes sort of the same strong growth that you\u2019ve seen in the first half or so far year to-date and therefore there is really not upside of the continues of the current trajectory? David Neithercut : Okay. So we\u2019ll certainly \u2013 today we\u2019re running 100 basis points in occupancy above same time last year. When you get into end of February that\u2019s going to compressed down to 80, when you get down to March that\u2019s going to go down to 60 or 40, which kind of goes back to the question is 97, the new 95? If that\u2019s the case, so -- and depending upon what happens with the new deliveries, you could see some gaping in the peak recently period. I mean, I think we\u2019re running 96 and change last summer. So, to get a big pickup from 96.5 is a little more difficult than getting that big pickup from 95. So then we had \u2013 I think we should be able to achieve in Q4 of 2015 pretty much the same occupancy that we achieved in 2014. So lot of the pickup is going to be in the first half of this year solely due to improved occupancy. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then on the development, I thought you mentioned that there is one patch that\u2019s delivering in the mid 4 to 6 and then 6 plus on the existing pipeline, just want to clarify that? David Neithercut : Well, we got to deal in San Francisco that we think we\u2019ll be about \u2013 we\u2019ll be a mid 4 delivery at current rents, so that was range from assets there, Alex. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just finally for Mark Parrell, a two-partner, one is on the CP program is the cost advantage just because the participants in that are subject to less regulatory issues that maybe line of credit lenders on as aggressive, and the next part is as you look at your \u2013 where you always about 2015, but as you look at your 2016, 2017 maturities that are above market, some of your other large brethren have spoken about possibly addressing those in advance, so just curious your take? Mark Parrell : Well, on the CP program, a lot of those buyers are various money funds, also corporates and just that market is very efficient market and it is a lower cost market than the bank market. I\u2019m sure the regulatory charges play into it. But I also just think that because REITs were not CP participants until very recently, there just wasn\u2019t a lot of air play between and banks frankly got the price of the credit maybe a little wider especially high quality guys like us than they probably should have been to. And I think the CP program we\u2019re going to kind of close that gap. In terms of 2016, 2017 we have fair amount maturing. We\u2019ll be really thoughtful about and we are already going to pull forward $200 million that are part pre-payable. We can do that either by pre-funding or we can do that by hedging. And I think with the input of our board we\u2019ll think we\u2019ve heard about that because as you on occasion we have kind of pre-funded these maturities and locked in these lower rates and right now being able to a 30-year potentially inside of 4% is very interesting, I have to say. So we\u2019ll be very thoughtful about that. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Andrew Rosivach with Goldman Sachs. Andrew Rosivach : Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking my call. I\u2019m trying to get just to a couple of AFFO numbers and it\u2019s got a couple of pieces. The first is that you guys give better disclosure than anybody on CapEx and you\u2019ve got your CapEx for same-store in 2014, one of the 1800 versus 1200 the prior and that increment just called $16 million is about 4% of our same-store NOI, I was wondering is there a redevelopment component to that? Mark Parrell : Sure. It\u2019s Mark Parrell, so what I direct you to is there\u2019s a little bit of guidance we\u2019ve given on page 23 and we talk about rehabs is was we call them. So these are not the $40,000 or $100,000 units tear it down to the studs type of things. These are kitchen and bath reworks that we do, but they do have often a revenue enhancing component and/or at least in part they\u2019re optional, some are asset preservation, but some are optional. So we do give you some separate guidance on that. So for example for this year there is three real pieces. The routine piece or replacements $350 a unit and I\u2019ve been about that number for a long time. And that\u2019s carpets and appliance replacements. Then we got these rehabs I\u2019ve just spoken. And a few years ago that was $250 to $300 a unit and we expect in 2015 that will be $600 a unit. And we\u2019ve signaled on prior calls that we\u2019re going to do a lot more rehab. We have a lot of opportunity. Andrew McCulloch : We have yeah. Mark Parrell : Yeah. So that\u2019s part of that increase the couple of hundred bucks and then we do have a third component, we call it building improvements and that\u2019s all the external stuff, air conditioners on top of high-rises complex to start work all of that. And what happened really there is the last couple of years had been a bit of a ketchup. So 2014 and we think 2015 if you look at 2013 that number was pretty low much lower than usual. And that was really us being maybe just a little bit busy integrating Archstone and not doing maybe all the capital projects we had originally budgeted. But I do think we now own more expensive assets and so I would think this 1800 plus we\u2019ll moderate a bit in out years. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s ever going to get back to 1400 when we owned our units, which is what it was when we owned again a much cheaper portfolio one of these commodity markets. Andrew McCulloch : So, that\u2019s the way I guess the way to translate this is you got that 869 for 2014 I can see on the footnotes you gave a sense of where it\u2019s going to be for 2015. So 350 would be kind of a recurring number and the above and beyond would be considered a rehab? Mark Parrell : Yeah not all in fairness the $600 per unit for rehab some of that we have to do. Some of those are asset preservation, but I would say clear majority of those or things we\u2019re doing with an IRR in mind or return in mind. And for us we I know that had a mid-teens return and we generally gotten that. So the 350 routine absolutely have to do of that 600 per unit that could easily go down 200 bucks a unit or more if we wanted it to. But we think right now it is a good use to shareholder capital. Andrew McCulloch : Do you have the sense just to get apples-to-apples for the couple of your peers, because everybody is kind of all over on this what the burnout has been on your same-store related to that activity? Mark Parrell : Well it varies we said before in general it will increase revenue by between 10 and 20 basis points. Now we have $2.6 of same-store or pull the revenue. So it is the big number Andrew this year for example in 2014 on that 4.3% reported number that had no impact and the reason for that is lot of these rehabs were done in Washington DC. And a lot of these rehabs are in their early stages where they\u2019re creating vacancy and not creating income and, because of that you just have no impact on the year. And but it just will vary year-over-year and some years it will be 20 basis points and some years zero. And we got to reiterate we\u2019re doing this as an asset preservation matter and we\u2019re doing, because an investment matter. We\u2019re not really trying to change in fact we aren\u2019t really changing our same-store numbers. Andrew McCulloch : Okay and obviously the increases -- but also under the other pieces that you guys have been touching on is the you\u2019ve been paying off the old Archstone debt and that\u2019s the result that that kind of non-cash benefit is getting smaller. And it maybe you could just remind me a kind of how much it was helping earnings in 2013 versus 2014 versus 2015? Mark Parrell : Yeah my chief accounting officer is smiling at me, because we spend a lot of time talking about this just in a last day or so. So I\u2019d refer you to page 15, and this is going to be a little technical, but I\u2019ll be very brief and we need to talk more about it we can. There\u2019s various premiums and discounts that are discussed at the bottom of that page the very bottom of 15. But the net result of all of this is that put aside cap interest for a moment -- but our reported interest expense for the year is within $2 million of what actual cash number is. All of these premiums discounts plus all the amortization of financing cost and very little net impact on what we report, because some goes one way and some goes the other. So the answer on Archstone and the rest of it is the Archstone debt is certainly disappearing we only have one real large pool in 2017 left. But in it\u2019s net impact on the company it\u2019s almost effectively is nothing. The interest expense into normalized FFO or regular FFO to that matter. Andrew McCulloch : And wouldn\u2019t happen to know what that 2 million was in 2014 to 2013, because s I recall it shrunk on much larger number? Mark Parrell : It was and I don\u2019t have that point of reference with me, but it was a much larger number particularly in 2013. We did from very large pay off in 2013. And that number came down very quickly so I mean there was certain benefit in 2013 but a lot it didn\u2019t last long I\u2019ll say that much. Andrew McCulloch : Great. Thanks for the time guys. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Dan Oppenheim, with Zelman & Associates. Dan Oppenheim : Thanks very much. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit more in terms of the thoughts on renewal rates in that you\u2019ve done a great job lifting occupancy and I\u2019m talking about 97% is being the new 95 sounds there a bit more focus on pushing rates here give the comments about February and March renewal increases. Are you basically and possibly accepting that through the move outs could go up move outs due to rental increases could go up slightly more as we get to the spring and summer or is that not a worry at all given sort of the thought that at the time of move in that the affordability is strong enough that they can handle it here? David Neithercut : Well I mean when you look at the reason to move out being too expensive. And in the whole portfolio is about 10%. Additionally we have also as part of our some of our internal initiatives and kind of rearranging the lease expiration schedule on the Archstone portfolio. We have moved more leases into the peak months than we previously have. But we don\u2019t see any slowdown in demand and I mean December just as a data point we saw our leaves increase in December by 14%. So for the quarter it was up 9%, so we continue to see demand there\u2019s been some articles recently the kids are starting to move out of the basement. I think all of that continues along with even retirees wanting to relocate back into the city there\u2019s just this huge magnet in the or urban core that is drawing everyone there that I think will serve us well and allow us to continue to ask for higher rents. Dan Oppenheim : Great. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Rich Anderson : Thanks how much of the 4% revenue growth expected for 2015 is in the bag and how much would you say still quote-on-quote speculative? In the bag from that? David Neithercut : The embedded it\u2019s 2 in change it\u2019s kind of all we\u2019ve been that way last three or four, five years. I mean that\u2019s just taking the rent roll and annualizing it as of January. But so even we get about probably 40% to 50% of that growth turns into revenue growth only because most of your expirations renewals occur maybe year. So if you\u2019re getting 8%, 6%, 7% renewal increases you\u2019re going to pickup 40% of that on average. Rich Anderson : Got you. Okay. And technical question for Mark Parrell, it could what is the benefit may read FFO from the first quarter from pursuit costs? Mark Parrell : Well refrain to that numbers on page 28. Rich Anderson : Yes I\u2019m. Mark Parrell : Yeah so the benefit there actually on the net so just because married FFO defined will be higher we believe than our normalized FFO and will be higher, because we anticipate that are not certain of having a litigation recovery a payment true-ups in settlement of losses. Somewhere in the $10 million $20 million, we put that in the guidance that goes in that same line so you are seeing it there as a big positive so something on the order of $0.04, $0.05 to the positive. And then we\u2019ll have half the penny to a penny of these proceed cost that we always got back to the married FFO number so that\u2019s what\u2019s going on there. That number will throughout the year decline and more of this pursuit cost will erode that litigation settlement and that\u2019s why the guidance for the whole year for married FFO and our normalized FFO is almost the same number just the penny differing at the mixed plate for a time being. Rich Anderson : Okay understood. Thanks. And then last question for me, you\u2019 re not calling bottom yet in DC you may soon but on the counter to that, I guess my question is what\u2019s your view on technology within industry, I mean did you see the strength right now, but to the extent that you\u2019re declining a bottom in DC are may some day is it possible will be soon declining a top or for telling it market Seattle, San Francisco, even Boston and Denver because the technology industry is starting to just look over, over done at this point. Just comment if what you\u2019re looking at and what you\u2019re looking for in those markets from a technology perspective. David Neithercut : Well, I guess I would say we spend a lot of time here just R&D and researching future opportunities, for technology so I think for the most part were in the beginning stage, just in the beginning stages of technology and the opportunities that will exist going forward.  Certainly, places like San Francisco, geographically limited but I don\u2019t see any reason to think that Seattle will slowdown, I mean when you look comparative rent levels to other major cities has plenty of rooms run.  And there is still this, again the magnet, many companies in Seattle that have headquarters or regional headquarters in the suburbs or relocating to the city become batch where the, the younger employees demand to work, so I\u2019m not sure this technology I think it\u2019s a broad-based urban revival. Rich Anderson : I guess, $40 million evaluation, some DC focuses are starting to call, what\u2019s happen in technology and worried about getting over done, you are not but you\u2019re -- just not seeing any of that not worried about it at all at this point is that a fair statement? David Neithercut : Well, we will be the first, we met at San Francisco\u2019s ahead bus I\u2019m not just, you\u2019re not suggesting for that and want again but we will also say every time that bus which is come back stronger than had previously, so you look the demographic picture, you just look at the David noted this, the reorganization is happening and you look at as millennial generation where they want to live, work and play. We continue to be very optimistic about want from opportunities in this poor urban centers and that doesn\u2019t mean that they want stumble or bus from time-to-time but we just think over the long term.  We are in a right assets and right markets. Rich Anderson : Got it, thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities. Tom Lesnick : Thank you. Actually my questions have been answered. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Vincent Chao : Yeah. Hi everyone. Just a past if I miss this but just in terms of the same store performance for the quarter being ahead of expectations and I talked about the positive early trends that you saw that you discussed in the third quarter continue in nature of the upside. But by the market I was just wondering if there is any particular market, they also do well but any one market really stand out as much better than you had expected as of the third quarter? David Neithercut : Well, I think when you look at the contribution to the overall growth, they were certainly San Francisco with what did I say 140 basis points improvement and occupancy so that was, typically we\u2019ve seen, we\u2019d this discussion over the past couple of years in that were at San Francisco so under house, why do we have seasonal impact. I think we just done a better job of managing explorations. In addition to outsize demand in few force, I guess I would say San Francisco definitely surprised relative to their contribution to the occupancy and we would expect them to continue to surprise this. Vincent Chao : Okay, so not sure that\u2019s the surprise but I guess just couple of mile in questions just to clean up here, it doesn\u2019t sound like equities part of the plan here this year but just curious you ended with 377 million shares, I think it\u2019s going to 380 for the guidance and is that just sort of the equity awards or is there something else going on there. David Neithercut : Right that just it\u2019s per hour just the effective employee, stock option exercises that we\u2019re predicting throughout the year. Vincent Chao : Okay, great. And then I think I heard 60% of the G&A spend is supposed to be in the first half of \u201915 was that GAAP G&A does that include the-- David Neithercut : Either way you got it. It will be in the first two quarters of year it will be 50% so whether you take our $52 million number or the GAAP 63 it will be the same kind of deferred. Vincent Chao : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from George Hoglund with Jefferies. George Hoglund : Yeah, sorry if I miss this but this $0.05 per share of lower NOI from higher OpEx in One Q15 and can you sort of elaborate what\u2019s driving that, I assume part of it\u2019s the, the metal expense true up from 4Q that goes away. Mark Parrell : Yes, we got a few things, we got $5 million increase in utilities and we\u2019ve certainly noticed here in Chicago it's gotten a lot colder since the December. We\u2019ve got a $4 million increase in payroll and that again these are all very common for us. And that payroll increase you got raises coming through the system, you\u2019re resetting all your accruals and about a $4, $5 million increase in real estate taxes because we\u2019re again resetting our accrual levels for 2015 as they relate to 2014, so all of that all together is the source of that negative 5. George Hoglund : And the reasons snow storm in north east will led impact any OpEx in 1Q. David Santee : On a same store basis probably not, I mean the impact in New York and DC was obviously very minimal. We typically just kind of take a three year average in our budgeted numbers so Boston was the only really had a major impact but I don\u2019t think there will be any material impact on Q1 numbers. George Hoglund : Okay. And then just last one, looking at acquisitions for the year based on what you guys are seen in the markets, what\u2019s becoming available any sense in terms of geography where there might be more acquisitions done and then also do you anticipate these being just stabilized assets or might there will be some recently developed assets was some lease up? David Santee : Well, again we just speculating but I would think all of the above, we all working on a deal recently completed deal in Boston and that could get done in the first quarter but other than that, it just, we will be looking at everything, it cause every market and making sure that we again -- we do by make sense related to the this position proceeds. And I would not be surprised we\u2019ve been seen just like we did in 2014 opportunities to buy something\u2019s have gotten a lease up risks, there is some development risk to every time from a completion stand point. Allows us to they have a competitive advantage David Neithercut : And if I can add its -- just another thing that\u2019s important when you do your modeling is timing, so our guidance assumes acquisitions occur effectively ratably throughout the year for about 25% of that 500 each quarter. Our dispositions as we instead in our remarks is front end loaded, you think about $300 million that should occur in the first quarter and the last will be spread evenly. All this can change but that\u2019s what our guidance is premised on and that\u2019s why you see a little bit more dilution as I said in my remarks running through the system. George Hoglund : Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley. Haendel St. Juste: Hi, thanks for taking my question guys. So, David a slight twist to an earlier question, you guys mentioned not ready call the bottom in DC in terms of operations. Curious how you're thinking DC from an investment perspective at this point? Is DC on your current potential investment, are you underwriting any opportunity there, curious if you are, how you would be thinking about near term NOI or IOR's for potential investment. David Neithercut : We\u2019re not currently underwriting anything to buy in that marketplace. We have looked at things, we do have a couple of land sites that have been inventory for a while that we may consider moving forward with afterwards we have maybe a 17 delivery might be good timing. But we\u2019re not underwriting anything and I\u2019ll tell you that we've not seen any real dimension in value at all of assets in that marketplace. We think values have held up very well. And so I\u2019m not sure that anyone will see any quote unquote opportunity in that marketplace. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. Appreciate that. And then following up from earlier comment about your trouble back building the development pipeline and translate with your - the improving outlet for LA market. Curious on your decision to sell the LA partial that you sold during the quarter. Can you give us some sort of colors of insight of the thought process there? David Neithercut : Sure. That was part of a four parcel acquisitions that we made in Howard Hughes complex on the 405 in -- where there were four parcels we\u2019re building on two of them. 500 plus units and we didn\u2019t wish to add more to our inventory in that location. And found the builder that paid us a very nice price to buy what we consider to be partial free. And at some point in time we\u2019ll sell partial four, which is a much smaller parcel and that disposition we did have a nice gain on a disposition relative to the value that we had attributed to that purchase. Haendel St. Juste: Appreciate that. And then lastly you mentioned the declining home ownership rate as a tailwind there that you and your peers have benefited from the last couple of years. Curious on the look ahead and specifically how you're thinking about the prospects for a single family recovery today as potentially a risk or a headwind for you. We\u2019ve seen housing estimates out there calling for 20% plus year-over-year starts growth, builders are offering a bit more incentives and we\u2019re starting to see slow improvement on a mortgage availability, which again collectively think slightly more competitive for sale dynamic. Curious on your thoughts there and then also do you want to broaden that out to include anything else on your sort of risk list as you think about this year even to next year? David Neithercut : We look at the single family housing national statistics as sort of an interest, and we do as I know we have seen fewer people move out of our apartments in 2014 to buy single family home. We are concentrated today in very expensive single family home market, I mean that was the part of the plan. And it\u2019s very expensive mortgages are hard to come by. Down payments are significant, and we\u2019re buying many of our residents 40 some odd percent of our units are occupied by a single individual and we don\u2019t sort of see that segment as particularly planned home buyer anyway. A lot of our residents I mean the 30 year old range we think value of flexibility and optionality is provided by rental housing. So it\u2019s a off a lot of things in our markets that differentiate us a little bit than what you might see in markets where the cost of single family housing is much lower not only in absolute dollars but as a multiple of income. So I think there are other companies in single family home rentals that I think are much more risk to what you maybe seeing about more focus and ease your mortgage availability etcetera with respect to single family housing set. Haendel St. Juste: Appreciate that. Just as a quick follow-up, do you guys have perhaps a recent stat on average tenant income or past rent as a percent of income? David Neithercut : We covered that previously and as David Santee, said we collect that data only at the point of application and point of moving. So we know that the most recent new occupants that number is been in the 20% range. Rent to income and that's been very consistent across our history almost regardless of the portfolio we\u2019re running in the markets which we\u2019re operating in. Haendel St. Juste: Thank you for that. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Salinsky : Given the comments on DC about possibly bottoming in 2015, not willing to call a quarter yet, can you talk about what that - what you need to see in that market to give you confidence that market's bottomed whether it's job growth or supply, and then also obviously different mix submarkets there. Where do you expect the pockets of real weakness to be in DC in 2015 relative to something we could see some strength in? David Santee : This is David Santee. I think first and foremost we have to see jobs, we have to see a greater degree of certainty and confidence from a lot of the government contractors. That's where it all starts. As far as the supply I mean for the most part, we have a excellent handle on what's coming online this year and we track as soon as someone starts moving there, so we know what's going to probably surplus in 2016. So, in 2015 your pockets of deliveries had shifted somewhat. So when you look up the makeup of our revenue growth, for 2014 the district for us was positive revenue growth. For 2014 the I-270 corridor was positive revenue growth for us. This year the deliveries are going to be in South Alexandria. It is going to have outsize deliveries I-270 corridor weather, Rockville, Bethesda, but at the same time, the RBC corridor is tailing off, so you could start seeing positive rent growth there. So, its just a matter of how strong the good pockets are and how weak the other supplied markets are and to what point in time during the year relative to improving economy and job growth. Mike Salinsky : Okay. Then just as my follow-up. Just given the comments about the tough acquisition environment, tough development environment as well and just the positive comments in redevelopment and we think about acquisitions in 2015. Does that make you more lean towards, maybe towards fees with a value added component or do you still see A's as offering the best up side in this point of the cycle. David Santee : I guess we\u2019re diagnostic, Michael. We bought properties across the quality spectrum and we\u2019ll acquire where we think we can find the best risk adjusted return. We bought A\u2019s, we bought B\u2019s, we bought C\u2019s and turned into B\u2019s I mean we\u2019re really quite agnostic about that. Mike Salinsky : Okay. Thank you much. Operator : And with no further questions, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to today\u2019s speakers for any additional or closing remarks. David Neithercut : Thank you all for joining us. We look forward to seeing many of you around the circuit in the coming months. Have a great day. Operator : And this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead, sir. Marty McKenna : Thank you, Ann. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's first quarter results.

Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

David Neithercut : Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. As reported in last night's earning release, our teams across the country did just a great job during the first quarter. Achieving 5% growth in same store revenue which was driven primarily by continuation of the strong occupancy that we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. We also did a terrific job on controlling expenses and delivered first quarter NOI growth of 7% and normalized FFO growth for the quarter of 11.3%.  There is absolutely no doubt that we continue to enjoy very strong apartment demand across our core markets. And David Santee will go into much detail in just a moment. But the strength is been experienced in nearly every market in which we operate. Driven by all that which we\u2019ve talked about over the last several years, including modestly improving economy that help produced a million new jobs in the last four months, 3.3 million in the last year. The creation of new households by the millennial generation which is generating significant demand for rental housing which is not being met by new supply today and the desire of so many to live in 24x7 cities across the country that have very high cost for the single family home ownership.  So, all in all multifamily fundamentals remain very favorable. The first quarter of 2015 produced very strong operating performance and we\u2019re pleased there are results here to-date and how we are positioned going into the primary leasing season have enabled us to raise our same store revenue guidance for the year to 4.3% to 4.7%.  With that said, I\u2019d let David Santee discuss in more detail what we\u2019re seeing across the country today. David Santee : Okay. Thank you, David and good morning everyone. Today, I\u2019ll be reviewing our results for the quarter, discuss our current position with respect to base rent and renewal increases and then update you on our markets and our three buckets of revenue growth.  All of these give us the confidence today to tighten and raise our full year 2015 revenue guidance. And while our expectations for Q1 performance were high, actual results were even slightly better. However, we remained full in the peak leasing season and peak deliveries across all of our markets are still ahead of us.  Q1 performance was a result of the continuation of the strong operating metrics that we delivered in Q4 with the key driver of being elevated occupancies compared to Q1 of 2014. On the same store portfolio realized in 80 basis point pickup and occupancy however more notably our core markets delivered a 100 basis point pick up ranging from a low 50 basis points in Boston to a 180 basis point in San Francisco. We continue to believe that these improved results are driven by strong demand from an improving economy, a shift in generational lifestyle preferences as more and more methods are chasing the urban lifestyle and continued declines in home ownership. As a result of the strength that we saw in Q4 and the expectation that the trend would continue, we have the confidence to extend renewal offers that achieve 6.3% growth for the quarter, higher since Q1 of 2012. Additionally, the percentage of residents that chose to renew with us this quarter was the highest since Q1 of 2008, a 56.1%.  Turnover continues to decline quarter-over-quarter falling from 11.3% to 11.2% with the percentage to move out to buy home dipping to 11.9%. The lowest percentage we\u2019ve seen since of 2012. In terms of real numbers move out to buy homes from 1,330 to 1,296 quarter-over-quarter representing about 1.3% of our total same store unit count.  Net resident turnover which factors out same community transfers fell 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter from 10% to 9.7%. As residents desire to remain in their building and neighborhood calls to them to move either up or down in rent with 60% choosing to move up.  Net affected new lease rents, the foundation for determining renewal increases average 5.1% year-over-year for the quarter versus 3.1% in Q1 of 2014. And it continues to remain at these levels till today. As we introduced second quarter the significant occupancy gains that we enjoyed in Q4 and Q1 have began to moderate as expected. Although, today we still enjoy an exposure rate that is 10 basis points slower than same week last year, an occupancy at 96.4% which is 50 basis points higher than same week last year. Renewal increase is achieved for April and May today are 7.2% and 7% respectively and based on our results thus far for June and July offers, we expect to achieve similar results for these months.  While Q1 for these outstanding revenue growth, those results were slightly better than our expectations that drive full year guidance, the peak licensees in just ramping up and reminding ourselves again that 2015 will see peak delivers. We\u2019re extremely pleased with our quarter to-date results and expected outcome till May and June.  Expenses for the quarter were generally in line however the route we took was quite different than our original road map. The North East storms resulted in significant snow removal cost and also impacted our ability to perform many services in house as our staff dealt with the inferiorly affects of the storm we were simply not able to make it to work. In the plus column all of these unexpected events were more than offset by the short declines in energy cost.  Real estate taxes representing over 36% of total expense are being revived downward from 5.35% for 5.1% for the full year. As a result of lower than projected values in Virginia and lower overall taxes in Denver and King County in Wash you\u2019re going to stay.  In the minus column, to save even real estate taxes will be not by higher payroll cost which is 22.5% of total expense as a result of the over time north east storms and fewer vacant positions across our portfolio. With energy cost remain sharply lower and a slight reduction in property insurance cost, we remain confident that we\u2019re track to hit the midpoint of our expense guidance range of 2.5% to 3.5%. Moving on to the market to lead up with Washington DC metro area, despite anemic job growth in record delivers during 2014, the DC metro area was able to absorb more than 14,000 units. As many as the government retirees live in homes in Suburbs, they\u2019re younger replacements chasing to live in the city with the amenities and transportation they need right outside their front door. New lease lands remains under pressure and on average are flat across the portfolio. However renewal rates achieved have increased from the low 3\u2019s during 2014 to the low 4\u2019s in Q1. Renewable on the books for April and May indicate this trend will continue throughout the year. Improvements in job growth are beginning to materialize and the previous multi year declines in the professional service sectors have bottomed and are expected to be positive going forward. At 17% of total NOI, any improvement in Washington Metro will certainly have a favorable impact on our full year results. With 13,000 units being delivered in 2015 and by our count another 9,700 in 2016, the metro area continues to be fairly stable. With occupancy up a 100 basis points today but with same week last, DC performance thus far is dead on our projected revenue growth assumptions. Seattle continues to meet expectations with concentrated deliveries in the East and North. Amazon\u2019s recent financial results board well and their 4,000 plus open positions in Down Town which paying an average $90,000 per year increased by 200 jobs versus same time last year. Expedia recently announced there would be relocating its headquarters from sub urge to the city with a high quality talent chooses to live work and play. Corporate relocations from the verge to the urban core are playing out in every major city across the U.S. and we would expect this trend to continue. San Francisco was the winning beneficiary of the improved occupancy that we saw in Q4 and Q1 with a 180 basis points increased over Q1 of \u201914. With minimal deliveries relative to outsize demand, we see no reason why San Francisco should not lead the way again in 2015 and we look forward to scale our results as we begin lease up on our new product and Emeryville and Downtown. Denver thus far continues to maintain its ranking as the second best market across our portfolio with peak deliveries of over 9,000 units this year. We would expect softness in the urban 4 to continue with softness being defined as only 5.5% revenue growth. With the majority of our portfolio located in the suburbs we wouldn\u2019t expect to see any material deterioration revenue growth for the full year. Additionally reports of actual or projected job losses as a result of the energy crash are few and far between. Los Angeles performance has shown tremendous strength in recent leagues. With net effective new lease rent growth approaching 7% today and renewal rents achieved averaging 7.5% thus far for Q2 versus 6.5% in Q1 will be moving Los Angeles to our plus 5% revenue growth bucket for full year 2015. With most of the port drama behind us and very strong demand in the valley and far North. Our broad base economy recovery has clearly materializing. With only 8,500 new deliveries expected in 2015 or should be minimal impact for this improved trajectory. Today representing almost 11% of our NOI, LA is delivering outcomes of 96.6% which is 100 basis points higher the same week last year and exposure that is 100 basis points lower than last year. It appears that LA is now on track for an extended month that will provide outsize growth for an extended period to the EQR portfolio. Orange County, San Diego and Emeryville Empire are all performing as expected. Since softness in Downtown, San Diego for new deliveries will constraint new lease rents. However renewal increase was achieved across the three markets range from the mid 6\u2019s to the mid 7\u2019s. Jumping over to Boston, new lease growth is going to continue to be under pressure as 70% of the 5000 new deliveries are concentrated in the urban core and Cambridge. With late 2004 deliveries spilling over into 2015. However despite the proceed impact from the winter storms, Boston absorbed over 4,600 units in the first quarter as demand and rental activity saw mill impact. As newly delivered office and lab space come online, we would expect to see increased demand in the urban core as the financial services and biotech industries continue their expansion. Our Boston portfolio is slightly better positioned than same week last year with lower exposure and 30 basis points better occupancy. With new lease pricing under pressure on the concentrated deliveries, the key driver of revenue growth for 2015 will be in the form of renewals where we achieved plus 5% through June. New York is steady as she goes. For Q1 the Jersey waterfront beat out Manhattan but only as a result of the poor results they experienced in Q1 of 2014. Going forward, we would expect Manhattan to continue to lead the metro area in revenue growth with modest weakness on the upper west side due to new and large unit count deliveries. Improved job growth in the higher paying sectors of business and professional services will certainly bolster demand for all the high-end product that has been recently delivered. In addition, it will help now to drop losses and the financial sectors appear to found the bottom. With the outsized deliveries in Brooklyn and Jersey City coming online, we are already seeing new lease price pressure and would expect that to play out in the next 12 months to 18 months. Last but not least, South Florida with over 12,000 units being delivered this year across the three county metro area, we expect the most severe pricing pressure in the downtown Miami submarket, where 50% of these new apartments will be located. The balance of new deliveries are mostly east of I-95 from Lauderdale all the way to West Palm Beach which insulates the bulk of our portfolio from direct competition. With only two EQR assets near downtown Miami and the balance of the portfolio further west of I-95, we should be well positioned to deliver another year of plus 5% of revenue growth. Job growth remained strong and diverse across the entire region with the potential implications of Cuba\u2019s new open for business policy providing more questions than answers. So summarizing our buckets of revenue growth, we now see the DC bucket is half full versus half empty and have challenged our team to meet or receive 1% revenue growth for the full year. And 13,000 new units still to come and meaningful job growth in the early stages, Washington DC will be a slow and steady climb from the bottom. Our 3% to 5% revenue buckets now contain San Diego, New York and the cautiously optimistic Boston which will be challenged to achieve a 3 or better. Our plus 5% bucket has the usual suspects with San Francisco and Denver leading the way yet again. LA now breaking out with 6 plus revenue growth followed by Seattle with a solid low 6 and then South Florida and Orange County in the low 5s. As we\u2019ve demonstrated it\u2019s still a great time to be in the apartment business and improve the economy and the generational shift in lifestyle choices will continue to produce outsized demand in the urban core. A decline in deliveries in 2016 across most of our core markets will most certainly extend the runway we have to grow revenue and produce results that are above historical trend for the foreseeable future. David? David Neithercut : Great, thank you David. As evidenced by the recent activity in our sector that remains a very strong bid for multifamily assets for many different segments in the investment community. As a result, the first quarter saw no acquisition activity in our part as pricing remains aggressive. We did sell three assets in the first quarter, two in Redmond, Washington and one in Agoura Hills, California for a total of $145.4 million at a 5.27% cap rate that we sold with the expectation that the buyer acquired about a 5% yield on those deals. These assets were each multiple building, gardens now assets average in 31 years of age and represented opportunities for us to sell into a strong investor demand of value-add product. Thus far the second quarter we have had some transaction activity occur that we think an interesting example of the market trading that you\u2019ll see as try and undertake going forward. Two weeks ago, we required a recently completed 202 unit property in Boston or a $131 million and a low four cap rate. Around that same time, we also sold a 41 year old 193,000 square foot medical office building in Boston or a 123.5 million or $639 per square foot at a mid four cap rate. This property is located next to Mass General and was required as part of our charges with investment 16 years ago with the current demand or healthcare assets, we saw great opportunity dispose of this billing and trade into a multi-family asset with far more upside in both earnings and NAV growth going forward. On the development side, we commenced construction on one new project in the first quarter representing the last of the four downtown San Francisco sites that we acquired as part of the Archstone transaction. We\u2019re building 449 units at a cost of $290 million and expected yield on cost at today\u2019s rents in the mid fives. We continue to assume that we\u2019ll start about $450 million of new development this year and we have a couple of smaller deals that we\u2019ll have to get underway yet this year to reach that goal. But more importantly similar to the acquisition market there is a lot of capital chasing development opportunities and land pricing has increased significantly. As a result and noted on our last call, we\u2019re not acquiring land to new development of the same rate as we\u2019re commencing construction and existing side in inventory. So in addition to reductions and start this year, we would also expect starts in Q3 is to be down from the level same over the last several years. And with that Ann, we\u2019ll be happy to open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Nicholas Joseph with Citi. Nicholas Joseph : Thanks so much, on the Boston acquisition, I wonder if you can talk a little more about that. What was attraction about that deal and if you\u2019re underwriting criteria have changed at all? David Santee : Well, I\u2019m not sure changed at all, we think that deal today Nick is probably our best located assets in the city. And we underwrote that deal that a high 7% IRR than I think that our expectation over the last several years then high 7, low 8 and we think that this will deliver within that range. Nicholas Joseph : And I guess just more broadly on the transaction environment today. You mentioned the strong bid and aggressive pricing. Is this an opportunity to actually trade out some of your non-core markets, if you can sign core deals to redeploy the capital? David Santee : Well, essentially all have been doing over the last half of dozen years. So yes, the challenge there is not finding interest in those assets we like to sell as evidence by $4.5 billion of assets we sold to help of the Archstone acquisition. But it\u2019s finding the uptake to redeploy those assets that capital. And I can tell you that of what we own today that we like to sale were no hurry to sell any of it, we\u2019ll happy to continue to own it, we will exit Orlando in the next month or so. But other than that what we have on our listed itself we\u2019ll in the meantime and when we find right opportunities to reallocate the capital we will, but we\u2019re in no rush to do so. Nicholas Joseph : Thanks. And then just finally on those dispositions, will they be from non-core markets or will they be non-core assets in your core markets? David Santee : I would say would be all of the above. We\u2019re getting low point today where, we can sale last non-core assets in our core markets, while we continue to sell out of non-core. So you\u2019ll see us do both. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Derek Bower with Evercore ISI. Derek Bower : Great, thanks. I just had a question on the guidance and the outlook. Are you certainly appreciate the guidance rate for the full year, but still imply deceleration to the back half of the year especially at the top-end. So can you just elaborate a little bit more on maybe the risk factors that get you to the midpoint even the top-end of guidance still has deceleration you had turnover I think is down lower since 2008 renewals or high 2012. So can you just collaborate a little bit more or may be what brings the deceleration throughout the remainder of the year, just given how strong the household formation numbers have been? Mark Parrell : Hi Jack, it's Mark Parrell, and I think David think you'll probably supplement this a little but we are mentioned before we really got a substantial occupancy and as such in the fourth quarter and again repeated that in the first quarter. And occupancy as David think, he just mentioned, remains very high. And so we do have positives in all regards on the operations side. But as you compare our occupancy in the second quarter; that we expect in 2015, the occupancy that we had in 2014, and you keep doing that throughout the year, they get closer those two numbers and there's just less occupancy benefit. So I don't think it's really as much anything about slowing down or decelerating our household formations being worse or anything like that. It's just the mechanics of the numbers when you have this occupancy improvement, that was so substantial, and that was in the slower part of our year in the end of the fourth quarter and be at the beginning of the first. David Neithercut : And the only thing I would add is, the fourth quarter and the first quarter, the numbers are great. Both on new lease rents, both on renewals, but your transactions on those quarters are so few. So that's why I remind everyone that we do have peak deliveries. We're just now entering the peak leasing season where more than 50% of our lease will turn and that's where we will make most of the money. So we don't see any really deceleration, like Mark said, it's just the mechanics of the numbers. Derek Bower : Okay, got it. And then just touching on margins, there was a bit of a deceleration sequentially from the fourth quarter. I know that's typical from the seasonality basis, but you get 100 basis point margin improvement last year in 2014 over 2013. What do you think is the projected run rate for \u201915 again? David Neithercut : As a margin? Yes, we put out 66%., 67%, I think those are good numbers. Like I want to point out our margin is fully [indiscernible]. So our property management cost, and everything that it takes to run that operation, IT, all property related legal, I mean all property related accounting -- so just when you're comparing apples-to-apples, you have the right comparative. Operator : We will go next to Nich Yulico from UBS. Nicholas Yulico : David, you mentioned the transaction market being -- what words you used exactly, but I think it was implying that pricing is pretty good and the selling apartment we you can't take out a cap rate that was probably about 100 basis points higher then, you guys had a much different portfolio. How do you think about, recognizing you guys don't need the capital, but how do you weigh may be doing a JV of punching your best lowest cap rate asset, just to kind of demonstrate to the market that this is where market pricing is and, this is where our stock is? David Neithercut : Well, I guess we consider such an event if we did have a use of the capital, and I guess I would suggest you that every day away from us there are trades being printed that demonstrating value of these assets. So I don't think we need to do something to make that clear to marketplace. That's happening every single day all around us. So again if something we consider, if we had a use of the capital, we don't at the present time. Development is fully funded. But it's not something that we would not consider. We will certainly be open-minded, if it makes sense. Nicholas Yulico : Okay, and then going back to this occupancy issue, you talked about. It looks like the comps get a little tougher throughout the year. You also said that, I think, in the second quarter so far you are over 96% occupied, and you're showing a good year-over-year growth and occupancy. So how do we think about this idea of recognizing that? The whole industry is kind of peaking occupancy and people are worried about year-over-year occupancy growth and yet, maybe we would get a push through that as an industry just because the main trend is so strong. What was considered as peak occupancy won't be peak occupancy. David Neithercut : Well, I think you are referring to kind of 97 is the new 95, and I mean I think we are optimistic that could play out. We didn't do anything differently relative to pricing philosophies or processes in Q4 and Q1, but yet demand really is the key driver and if you take the position that some of these core markets are really under house going back 10 years and we have an improving economy, I completely agree that there is no reason why 97 could [audio gap] be kind of the new standard for the years to come in some of these core markets. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to John Kim with BMO Capital markets. John Kim : Thank you. I really had just one data point with some seasonality. But how concerned are you of the weak GDP number that came out this morning? And particular if GDP moderates, let\u2019s say 2% growth this year, how much will that impact your ability to raise rents at two times that rate? David Santee : We haven\u2019t that time of course to analyze the GDP number that just came out a couple hours ago. But some of that relatively low number was based on lower exports and U.S. dollar strength and things that just really don\u2019t have a direct impact and I\u2019m not suggesting none of our residents or employee being export oriented industries. But it\u2019s just I think one number for one quarter and it\u2019s been a pretty uneven recovery. So I guess we don\u2019t, we feel like supplying demands [we can sell] at this point in our business. John Kim : Okay and on the asset sales during the period, was it an important distinction that they were sold in the sub-urban markets? Are you continuing to focus your portfolio in the core studies? David Santee : I guess they are representatives of the assets that we\u2019ve been selling over the past half of those years being older, garden surface park kind of properties and in response to one of your earlier questions that you\u2019ll being to see more of that in our core markets going forward. So the older garden type product in our core markets, you\u2019ll see is trade out going forward providing we can find the reinvestment opportunity. John Kim : Got it and then also on your development pipeline the stabilize deal you disclosed this period on complete and stabilized development with 5.9% which I think was one of the highest number if you produce in last few quarter. But I was wondering if you could disclose the yield of the developments that we are stabilize this quarter of a completed in prior quarters? David Santee : Stabilize this quarter, I mean approaching 6% I guess the deal is that we completed in 2014 which I assume will then be those would stabilize this year. We think we\u2019ll stabilize in the upper five close to 6%. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning, just a few questions here and I\u2019m going to guess that they are both for Mark will take them, the first is the Fannie and Freddie issue with their production caps. If the FHA doesn\u2019t increase those caps, are you concerned about an impact as far as in the most multi-family market or is it something the private lenders already stepping up and even if both Fannie and Freddie have accounted for 60 billion in total. It\u2019s not going to impacted in that private lenders will step in there but it won\u2019t disrupt pricing or transactions in multifamily? Mark Parrell : I mean we\u2019ve been monitoring that situation for a while and just so everyone has the fact straight Fannie and Freddie were given by the regulator a $30 billion per year production limit and they are getting relatively close to those limits. Currently the regulator is considering this matter and may have some sort of decision in the near term. What I\u2019ll say about EQR\u2019s capital needs and you were asking more about this positions which I\u2019ll get through in a minute but I mean we\u2019re lucky and it\u2019s enviable position of having access in the secured market and preferred market and the like company market will trade now is very competitive and very strong and all those markets now except the preferred market are cheaper than Fannie and Freddie for us. On the disposition side we have not seen any impact and in fact just sold an asset few days ago in Orlando and though there has been a lot of discussion about this matter in investment sales community. There wasn\u2019t any impact on our pricing we weren\u2019t re-traded on it, so we\u2019ll have to see what the regulator decides i.e., more of the opinion that the market can adjust to some of this if given time, but we\u2019ll just have to wait and see. David Santee : Let me add just one thing here out if I may, I\u2019d be far more concerned about this if we still own the $5 billion of product that we had sold over the last couple of years and what we own today. As I\u2019ve noted in one of my responses to one of the previous question, we\u2019re fine knowing that what we have today and I think that to that source of debt capital is far more important to what we have already sold and what we would sell going forward. Alexander Goldfarb : And then the second question is on your CP program. The recent articles in the newspaper about moving some of the money markets to flooding any of these rather than fixed, does that affect the buyers of your CP paper? Would those buyers now buy short-term governments or the buyers of your CP paper are not the same as the people who have the prime funds et cetera? David Santee : Yes I think the later. We\u2019re A2/P2 rated, so corporate own us maybe a life insurance company or two owners love put money aside waiting for long term bond issuances to come out in the market generally. It is at the high quality. They\u2019re not really allowed to own A2/P2 paper, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to make a great deal of difference to us. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors. Dave Bragg : On the topic of elevated occupancy, we seem to be attributing not a lot to strong demand, but can you talk about what you\u2019ve done to reduce frictional vacancy if that could get everyone a lot more comfortable with this idea of sustainable higher occupancy levels? David Santee : Well I mean that your biggest cost in vacancy is on turnover is vacancy I mean turn costs are relatively minimal. Actually just in the last let\u2019s just say three weeks, we have sales meetings across all of our markets twice a year and I attended four of them in the past two weeks. And really the easiest way to reduce frictional vacancy is through retention and I think a lot of people in San Francisco understand what\u2019s going on. Residence and under -- in San Francisco expect large increases. We see we get numerous emails from residence regarding renewal increases and what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve really made an effort to give our people the tools to better negotiate and not necessarily negotiate but to educate our residents. So our renewal discussions with residents are more about showing them what our competitors are charging bringing up rents on online and so that they can see that this isn\u2019t something that just EQR\u2019s doing, this is a macro event that is impacting pretty much everyone. And I think we have very good success with that and that\u2019s why I think you see even though renewals continue to accelerate, turnover continues to decline. And then certainly just well-located buildings with access to amenities let outside the door and great service by our onsite staff altogether produce great retention. Dave Bragg : Also, can you point to a change in the number of days that an apartment is down between when a renter departs and the new renter comes in? Have you been able to achieve any efficiencies on that front in the last call it five years or eight years? David Santee : Well so, so that\u2019s \u2013 there was a seasonal impact to that, so kind of average days vacant call it November through January or probably in the high 20s as you start getting into high traffic season, it comes down to the low 20s, it\u2019s not 20 on average, but there is a lot of noise in those numbers. What we do is we really hold, we measure the -- whole time. So everyday we\u2019re measuring how many days our staff are holding apartments for people that are moving in the vacant unit. Someone wants to run a vacant unit, they have to kind of take occupancy financial response within five to seven days. And we try to do that on our notice to vacant unit as well and some of that those vacancy days are influence to some degree by the level of rehabs that we\u2019re doing, because it just, it kind of extend out those days by two to three weeks. Mark Parrell : Yes, I just want to reinforce that distinction between the time of economic responsibility and the time of occupancy. Right, some of the comments any department 60 days is decline to choose or paying for today. And that\u2019s one let me take off a lot of people out there, I think on the top operations that will not require as strict about when we have to take on the financial obligations relatively one actually take, compared to one actually take occupancy. David Santee : And David just at a final note. David Santee mentioned on the last call are we moved a lot of our lease expertise around. So that we had four of them in the periods of time where as David Santee said we have the longer whole period. So we have move to significant amount of our lease explorations out of that slower period of demand. So that should give you higher occupancy overtime as well. David Bragg : Okay, thank you for all of that. Next question relates to the Boston acquisition. Can you just walk us through what looks to be a mid four cap purchase to a high 7 IRR? Mark Parrell : Well, it\u2019s call rental growth. All being in a great asset, in a great location that May as David Santee is discussing today be one that is maybe challenge because of new deliveries, but we think over an extended time period we\u2019ll do very well for us. David Bragg : Okay. Just rental growth no cap rate compression. Mark Parrell : No, no. In fact not cap rate compression on the exited all. David Bragg : Okay. Last question just goes back to this broad currently very robust appetite for multi-family assets. Given the interest some interest in other assets aggregators. This is always a tough thing to quantify. But David you observe any degree of portfolio premium today? David Neithercut : I guess, its portfolio premium or platform value. I don\u2019t know, I think look at quite obvious that the private equity firms have raise off a lot of capital. Many of them under waited, under invested in multi-family. Multi-family is an extremely leverageable asset and I think that\u2019s may people very interest in the space and be willing to be very aggressive in pricing. Whether or not that creating portfolio premium, I can\u2019t tell you what platform value, I\u2019m not sure. But there is no question that is an off a lot of large capital sources out there that have been looking at this space. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Ian Weissman with Credit Suisse. Ian Weissman : Good morning. Most of my questions have been asked in answer. But just if you could flush out a little bit your color on DC. -- are mentioned yesterday that the recovery in DC is really happening more in the urban core. I was hoping you can maybe address some of that comment and maybe decide for between CBD and suburban markets? David Neithercut : Yes, let me, it\u2019s can\u2019t jumping around for few one, the numbers can play out, you see the strongest growth and the I270 code or suburban Northern Virginia and then South Arlington. However, this year you are going to see most of the deliveries in the I-270 Corridor more possessed. So Q1 the only market that was really negative for us was Alexandria and again South Alexandria, Alexandria is where a lot of the deliveries in 2015 will occur. So what was good this past year will probably be under pressure this year. If that helps. David Neithercut : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And just one final housekeeping issue, it looks like there was 6.9 million or so an income from the law suit settlement that JV in 1Q that should be backed out to keep the normalize FFO. It looks like you are backing out $0.02 more in 2Q, is that also from a law suit settlement or is there something else going on? Mark Parrell : Correct. That\u2019s another expected $10 or $11 million we\u2019ll see timing could shift and ops can shift. Ian Weissman : Related to another issue or [indiscernible] Operator : You\u2019ll go next to Richard Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Richard Anderson : I guess when I just do a quick look at my NAV and I put a foreign on quarter type cap rate I mean I get to something close to 90 bucks for you. I mean is EQR too big to sell? Mark Parrell : I wouldn\u2019t think so. I think Sam has demonstrated the sale of EOP that we wouldn\u2019t be too big to sell. Richard Anderson : Okay. I mean we talk about portfolio premium all the rest maybe just occurred to me maybe we should be talking full anyway. The other question is much more term of a small level on the Boston acquisition would you made that deal in the absence of the MOB sale or is it all about the trade? Mark Parrell : I guess, I\u2019m not sure, I can answer question Rich because we didn\u2019t think about it in that manner. We like this asset, we\u2019ve look this asset for a while, that have been first part of like portfolio sale and there is one that we had identified. But we\u2019d like to own if we could break it out of the portfolio. When it became available, we moved on it and my guess is we probably would have bought it. We think positively long-term about this location about the quality of this asset, about what\u2019s happening Boston and my guess is that we probably would have bought it without the sale of the office [building/billing]. But being able to trade with the office building I think probably just help. But I think it is something that we would have strongly considered even if we didn\u2019t have the office building of the source of capital. Richard Anderson : Okay and then last question quick on for Mark. I know this duplicity charge declined this quarter versus last, is there a some sort of accounting adjustment there? David Neithercut : Yes, just the change in estimate. This is charge we thought pretty exact comp program would be 11 million and now in the 9 million and just we as we got full information we just refine the estimate. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Rob Stevenson with Janney. Rob Stevenson : Good morning guys. How active these days are you guys on the redevelopment front? Are you taking on wholesale redevelopment or you basically just selling those assets and redeploying capital? Mark Parrell : We are doing and we give you a fair amount of disclosure and then on page 21, our kitchen and bath renovation process which we call rehab and we spend about 50 million doing that, some of that is asset preservation and some of that certainly optional and accretive. We are doing a couple of large redevelopments one specifically out in Los Angeles. We took that asset at a same store. So I think as you see that we own more and more of these that are very hard to replace. I think you\u2019ll see spend money on these larger scale renovations and we move those from same store like other folks do and now these kitchen and bath refreshes I think those will stay in same store and be something we spend $30 to $60 million on the year end. Just help us to stay current in the market. David Santee : Yes, I would say in general Bob assets that we considered to be medium long-term holds will continue to do these rehabs as Mark suggested. On assets that we think would be short on term holds that might benefit from such a capital expenditure. We might often sell that asset not unlike the three that we sold in the first quarter for a value add player. We think that we would might realize more value selling that upside to a third-party rather than trying to do it ourselves and then sell it after the fact. Rob Stevenson : In terms of the 144 million of land for development on the Page 19, how many projects does that include and how many of those are shovel ready today? David Santee : I can\u2019t say definitely how many that includes and any that would be shovel ready today may very well be starting. We do have a couple of sites in DC that have kind of been ready for a while that we kind of put on ice, but anything outside of that, they\u2019re not shovel ready yet and when they are ready, we\u2019ll start construction on them. Rob Stevenson : And then lastly, given the commentary around the reduction in real-estate tax expectations for this year, do you guys think that you\u2019re finally over the hub in terms of the really big increases or is this just a specific instance where you got a good benefit out of a couple of markets? David Santee : Well I think if you go back and listen to some of our previous discussions, the 421 A abatement or burn off in New York City will add a 160 basis points to maybe a 180 basis points to our real-estate tax number for the next four years to five years. So I think this year, we\u2019ve kind of couple of breaks. There\u2019s still some bright spots that could materialize throughout the year, but I think high 4s low 5s are probably in the cards for the next several years. Rob Stevenson : Okay. David Santee : Just as a result of New York. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Dan Oppenheim with Zelman & Associates. Dan Oppenheim : I was wondering if you can just talk a little bit about DC I think with that comments of in terms of having a site that\u2019s ready you\u2019ve been waiting on. It seems that there are many others as well in that position. You have any concern that when you do see some sort of recovery in the market that there\u2019s enough supply that comes that ends up being a very immediate recovery there? Mark Parrell : I guess that\u2019s how the process that will analyze Dan when we believe that it might make sense. I\u2019m not sure that if there are [indiscernible] a lot of other sites they\u2019re ready to go, I\u2019m not sure the owners of those sites will have the capital and the financing given that marketplace to go forward and there may be an opportunity for the more highly better capitalized companies to actually sort of get ahead of that, but it\u2019s certainly something that we\u2019ll consider when we decide to go forward on that. Dan Oppenheim : And then in terms of 315 on A in terms of the acquisition there buying a one year old assets there [indiscernible] for value add projects, do you think it\u2019s a better market in terms of the acquisitions for those who where you can buy something that\u2019s recent development but without the lease up risk to it that way? David Neithercut : I\u2019m not sure I can say anything for certain. Last year a fairly significant share of what we did acquire, we bought either in some stages of lease up and even considered buying something that was under development and my expectation we\u2019ll continue to consider those kinds of opportunities because I think that can help us get a enhanced yield, but I guess it\u2019s very difficult to say if there\u2019s anything going on out there of any sort of opportunity other than there\u2019s just not a lot of supply and a lot of capital chasing it. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to George Hoglund with Jefferies. George Hoglund : Yes I just wanted to see on San Francisco and Northern California in general if the strong job growth continues, how long do you think we can see these sort of high single-digit low double-digit rental increases? Mark Parrell : Well we\u2019ve been asking that question for four years now. who\u2019s to say, I mean the deliveries are primarily in downtown San Francisco. So you\u2019re not delivering much of anything in the peninsula, a lot of your growth is being, you\u2019re seeing double-digit growth far out in Dublin and now Auckland which was not desirable place to be. So I think what was a Facebook added double the number of positions or increase 50%. As long as that continues, I don\u2019t see any into these increases. David Santee : And let me just maybe answer that question in a different way. And say that our average rent in San Francisco still well below New York City and Boston. Right, so putting a size the rate of average, the absolute rents are still not at the highest in our portfolio. Mark Parrell : I think, I just suggesting that would see at they would continue to be headroom there. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks for that color. And then also on DC just given the recent trends. When do you think, we could really see material improving DC, I mean giving all the delivery still coming online? Mark Parrell : I mean we\u2019re still at that flat to down. So I think it\u2019s just going to be the velocity of job growth perhaps change in administration and reallocating more dollars back to defense spending. I think it\u2019s going to take something from the government to really jump start the economy. But like I said, I think it will be a slow call back until there is some meaningful catalysts which most likely would be the federal government. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Jana Galan from Bank of America. Jana Galan : Thank you. Just a quick question on the development pipeline looks like 170 Amsterdam push that one quarter was that just weather related? Mark Parrell : Yes, I guess, I just got no that you can push property back one month and have that be one quarter was really nothing to be. There is no story there Jana. Jana Galan : Okay, thanks. And then just on the energy cost savings, is that change outlook for the rest of the year or maybe we could see some benefit as the year --? David Neithercut : Well, I guess, I would say that we\u2019re from a natural gas perspective, we\u2019re writing the market. We did take average of some great for the winter strip beginning December and that continues into March of 2016. So we\u2019ve locking some material savings there. But I think we\u2019ll continue to see days in both electric, electric actually is the bigger driver and as more -- plan in the Northeast convert to natural gas, I think we\u2019ll continue to see benefit from that on both natural gas and electric. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets. Michael Salinsky : Dave, I think characterize the market I saying a lot of demand just seeing a little of supply on the market today. Is that supply today, I mean is that quality supply sitting in -- house or is it mostly value-add. And then just as for several years into the cycle right now, while the early supply that was build --. Do you seeing more and more that kind of come to market there is kind of restocking the pipeline? David Neithercut : Well, we keep expecting too. I will tell you every year Alan, George and his guys comeback had may senior into January saying that the brokers have telling them that they\u2019re getting being also to request for opinions and value et cetera and we continue expect to see new supply. But I guess maybe with financing rates available to refinance these assets and just the scarcity of them it\u2019s possible people that are not willing to sell at this period of time. Clearly, we\u2019re probably a little bit more selective and what we\u2019re willing to buy today which may have served narrow the scope of what we\u2019d be willing to consider but there is just not much out there, we do underwrite a lot, we bid on what knowing that we\u2019re not likely win, so we stay in touch of the market. But I think that never seen our acquisition list as be as it is today. Michael Salinsky : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. We\u2019ve see a lot of actual grounded up to that kind of development in New York city right now. Have you seen any pick up in terms of conversion activity be at New York or any other market right now. Mark Parrell : I think what would -- the conversion I think is been more talked than action. There is certainly been some limited but they\u2019re very risky proposition takes an of lot of capital and takes an extremely long time to actually execute and people have talked a lot about potential for conversion but we have seen less than we would expect given the share that we\u2019ve heard about it. Operator : At this time there are no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back over to David. David Neithercut : Thank you very much. So, before you hang up I want to thank everybody for your time and your interest in Equity Residential today. And to let you know that on Monday afternoon of the meetings in New York City in June we\u2019re got to be hosting some tours of our new developments our Park Avenue South and Amsterdam at 68, street. And you all will be receiving a notice and invitations of that. So, stay tuned for more details. So, thank you very much, look forward to see you all in meeting June. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Please go ahead. Marty McKenna : Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's second quarter 2015 results. Our featured speakers today are David Neithercut, our President and CEO, David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer, and Mark Parrell, our CFO. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. And now I'll turn the call over to David Neithercut. David Neithercut : Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us for our call today. As reported in last night's earnings release, our teams across the country continue to do a really great job, achieving 4.9% growth in same-store revenue in the second quarter, and 5% same-store revenue growth for the first half of the year. This strong performance was driven primarily by increases in rental rate, and the continuation of increased occupancy levels first experienced toward the end of last year. There's no doubt that we continue to enjoy very strong apartment demand across our core markets, despite elevated levels of new supply. This demand's being driven by the powerful combination of favorable demographics, an improving economy and good job growth, which create new households and millennials to have a high propensity to rent housing, and wish to do so in 24/7 cities across the country that have very high costs of single family home ownership. So in a nutshell, business remains very, very good. We're pleased with how our primary leasing season unfolded. We're pleased with our results year-to-date, and our outlook for the year. We're pleased with what we're seeing in the markets in which we operate, and with the assets we own in those markets. And we're extremely confident that fundamentals will continue to deliver above trend performance for many years to come. So to discuss a bit more about our markets, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, David Santee. David Santee : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. As we discussed during our Q1 call in April, the jobs-driven surge in apartment demand that materialized last summer continues to fuel superior operating results, in spite of elevated deliveries across most of our markets. As expected, the 100 basis points of occupancy gain we enjoyed in Q1 across our core portfolio continued throughout Q2, setting the stage for results that were better than expected, and providing an operational springboard as we moved into peak leasing season. On our most recent call, we said that the strength that we saw in Q4 gave us the confidence to extend renewal increase offers for Q1 that resulted in renewal growth rates not seen since Q1 of 2012. Today, we are pleased to say that this trend continues throughout Q2, and we achieved a portfolio renewal growth rate of 7.2%, the highest growth rate since implementing our new platform in early 2008. I am pleased to say that this trend continues, with July on the books at 7.1% and August already at a 7%, which will continue to grow throughout the month. Additionally, the percentage of residents who chose to renew with us was virtually unchanged from the previous two years at 53%, which also contributed to our combined Q2 renewal and new lease rate growth of 5.8%. New lease space rents continue to average 5% year-over-year for the quarter, and improved to 5.5% for much of July. Turnover increased to 14.5% from 14.1% quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by affordability. However, factoring in residents transferring to another apartment within the same community, year-to-date annualized turnover is down 30 basis points from 2014. Home buying at 12.5% of move-outs remains in check across many of our markets, increasing from 776 units in Q2 a year ago to 1,914 this quarter, with the incremental increase being driven by Denver and Seattle. As high velocity rent growth continues to drive many of the West Coast markets, we experienced 180 basis point increase in percentage of move-outs due to rent being too expensive. However, the line at the door remains long, as demand measured by our online e-leads increased 17% in Q2, versus Q2 of 2014. The resulting applicants that chose to rent from this pool of inquiries also had the highest percentage of 720-plus FICO scores out of the last eight quarters, with 90% of all applicants being auto-approved. Now, touching briefly on the health of our markets and our three buckets of revenue growth, San Francisco, Denver, Seattle, Los Angeles, Orange County and South Florida all make up the plus 5% revenue growth bucket listed in order of year-to-date revenue growth. San Diego, New York and Boston remain in a 3% to 5%, with Boston teetering, and DC in a bucket by itself, at a positive 40 to 80 basis points. The color remains the same, and the picture is bright across all of our markets. We're halfway through a year of elevated deliveries across most of our markets. People of all ages and companies of all types continue to move to the city, as the generational shift in lifestyle preferences continues to take root. Not just in our core markets, but in cities all across the nation. Broad-based job growth is driving increased absorption and record lease-ups, and for all these reasons we are confident in delivering on our increased revenue guidance. Now [blowing right on the horn], Seattle continues to absorb units at a rapid pace, with 25 new jobs being created in the central business district every day. As expected, the northern suburbs followed by Bellevue are delivering the strongest revenue growth. However, many central business districts and Belham [ph] Capital Hill communities are beginning to show signs of acceleration as delivery of new units are absorbed. Strong earnings performance announced by Amazon last week will certainly continue to drive positive momentum in the downtown markets San Francisco continues to suffer from a housing shortage, as evidenced by year-over-year new lease rents which are up 13% versus same week last year. San Francisco continues to be a key driver in our revised revenue guidance. Southern Cal continues to be solid, with LA County leading the way in this broad-based economic recovery, with only small pockets of disruption due to new lease-ups. Concentrations of new deliveries in the Irvine area, and lower than expected job growth caused Orange County to take a back seat to the growing excitement and investment into the revitalization efforts in downtown LA, and a multi-year development of Silicon Beach. Boston continues to perform as expected, with virtually no pricing power in the downtown financial district. Outer sub markets continue to perform at or above trend, as new development is virtually nonexistent. New York Metro continues to add a steady pace of new jobs, and Manhattan assets show strong demand and rent growth. However, Brooklyn is feeling the effects of concentrated deliveries, and we would expect the same to occur later in the year on the Jersey waterfront. DC continues to bump along the bottom, but with encouraging job growth numbers that are above the national average. As pockets of new deliveries come online in the South Alexandria and Rockville areas resident growth has deteriorated, while submarkets that have completed deliveries are on the mend. Our RBC corridor submarket remains the most challenged, with year-to-date revenue growth of minus 1.2%. While we are only halfway through our 13,000-plus deliveries expected this year, we still expect our DC Metro portfolio to deliver slightly positive revenue growth for the full year. Expenses for the quarter were in line with expectations. Real estate taxes, which account for 36% of total expense, remain unchanged at 5.07%. Maintenance and building expenses remain elevated, as a result of the storms in Q1, which are offset by significant savings in energy costs year-to-date. As a result, full year expense growth will be in the range of the midpoint of our revised guidance. Demand for apartments in great locations is exceeding even our best case scenarios. With a strong jobs outlook and a generational shift in home ownership, apartment fundamentals are better than any other time in our history. With deliveries across almost all of our core markets declining in 2016, and the belief that urban lifestyle preferences will continue its trend, some believe that many cities across the country are significantly underhoused to meet the growing demands of all age cohorts, creating a road map for continued above trend growth for the foreseeable future. David? David Neithercut : Thanks, David. On the transaction side, we were able to acquire one asset in the second quarter, which remains the only asset acquired in the first half of the year, and remains so year-to-date. We briefly mentioned this acquisition in the first quarter call, which was a 202-unit apartment property in Boston that we acquired for $131 million at a low 4 cap rate.  I've mentioned on several of our recent calls just how difficult it is for us to acquire assets today, given the very strong bid for multifamily assets from many different segments of the investment community. As a result, we've reduced our expectations for acquisitions this year to $350 million. Obviously, with only $131 million of acquisitions in the first half of the year, this means we will have to find another $220 million of deals before the year is up, and I'll have to admit that they're not on our radar at the present time. So we've got our work cut out for us for the balance of the year to achieve that goal. On the disposition side, we did sell three residential assets in the second quarter, along with the medical office building in Boston.  The three multi-family assets were all in Orlando, and represented our last remaining assets there, so we have now totally exited that marketplace. These assets averaged 14 years of age, and were sold at a weighted average cap rate of 6%, and unleveraged weighted average IRR of 8.7% inclusive of indirect management costs. We calculate the weighted average buyer cap rate at about 5.4% on those purchases.  As discussed also on our most recent call, in the second quarter we sold a 41-year-old, 193,000 square foot medical office building in Boston for $123.5 million or $639 per square foot and a mid-4% cap rate. Located next to Mass General, this asset was acquired as part of our Charles River Park investment 16 years ago. And with the current demand for healthcare assets, we saw great opportunity to dispose of it, and trade into the recently completed multifamily property in Boston, with far more upside in both earnings and NAV growth going forward. Disposition guidance for the year has been reduced modestly to $450 million, and so there's no misunderstanding, the medical office building sale is included in this number. This means that we expect to sell less than $100 million over the remainder of the year. We're currently under contract to hit this number, and our disposition guidance will likely change only if we can find more opportunity to reinvest disposition proceeds, which as I noted previously will be a tough task given the competition for assets today. In the quarter, we commenced construction on one small development project in Washington, DC, where we're building 174 units for $73.2 million at an expected yield on cost at today's rents in the mid 5%s. This deal is in the Mt. Vernon triangle market directly across the street from our 425 Mass Avenue property, and will be delivered in the second half of 2017, which we think will be a very good time to bring new product to the marketplace. This start brings year-to-date starts to $377 million, with the potential to start as much as [$460 million] of new developments for the full year. Similar to the acquisition market, there's a lot of capital chasing development opportunities, and land pricing has increased significantly. As a result, and as noted in our last call, we're not acquiring land for new development at the same rate we're commencing construction on existing sites held in inventory. So in addition to a reduction in starts this year, we would also expect starts in future years to be down to levels seen over the last several years. We're also very pleased to have completed our new development on Manhattan's upper west side at Amsterdam and 68th Street in the second quarter. Hopefully, many of you saw this asset in June when we hosted tours during the NAREIT meetings. And we [indiscernible] showed -- showed on our cover of last night's earnings release. Like most assets priced several years ago and coming online in the current marketplace, we're seeing strong absorption, at rent levels at or above our original expectations, and we currently expect this asset to stabilize in the low 7%s. So I'll now turn the call over to Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Thank you, David. I want to take a few minutes this morning to talk about the revisions we made to our guidance for the full year, as well as discuss our recent debt offerings. In yesterday's release, we revised our guidance for our same-store metrics, as well as for our normalized FFO per share for the year. I want to take a minute now to give you some color. As David Santee discussed, we continue to enjoy very strong demand for our properties. As a result, we have raised our expectations for our same-store revenues to 4.75% to 5%. Our new midpoint of 4.9% is a 40 basis point improvement from the midpoint we guided you to in our first quarter release, and an 80 basis point improvement from the guidance midpoint we gave you to start the year back in February. We have also raised our expectation for occupancy for the full year to 96%, which is up slightly from the guidance we gave you last quarter. As we have discussed before, we are getting a benefit from both rental rates, and running our portfolio at a higher occupancy level than we have traditionally. On the expense side, we have narrowed our range to 3% to 3.25%. David Santee talked about the drivers of that activity. Expense growth will be higher in the second half of the year than the first half of the year, due to the more challenging comparable periods. I'd ask you to remember that we posted quarterly expense growth of 0.6% in the third quarter and 2.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014. So overall, we anticipate annual expense growth for 2015 to be about where we expected at the beginning of the year. We are proud of our strong expense control record, and have posted a five-year compound average growth rate for annual expenses of only plus 1.7%. We now expect NOI for the full year to be between 5.5% and 6%, and we have reset our range for normalized FFO per share for the year to $3.39 to $3.45 per share. At a new midpoint of $3.42 per share, this is a $0.01 per share improvement from our April 2015 guidance. So I want to break out these details a little bit further for you. Our improved expectation of same-store operating performance should lead to about a $0.02 per share increase in normalized FFO. We also now estimate that interest expense will be about $4 million or $0.01 per share lower than we've previously expected. And this is due to the smaller amount of debt we will now issue in 2015, and we're just going to issue the $750 million that we already have -- we already put out in May, versus the $950 million we had in our previous guidance. With dispositions now anticipated to exceed acquisitions by $100 million, the excess cash will be applied for now to reduce debt, and will eliminate the need to source additional debt in 2015. Also, we expect to have higher capitalized interest than our prior guidance, due to a slightly faster pace of development spending than we previously expected. We are also getting a benefit from lower floating rates on our successful new commercial paper program. On a negative side, we'll see about $0.02 per share more transaction dilution than we expected. And that's primarily as a result of our lower expectations for acquisitions. As we stated in our release, and as David Neithercut just described, we have lowered our expectations for acquisitions to $350 million for the year, and that's down from $500 million, and we have now assumed that any of these acquisitions that we do occur very late in the year. To sum it up, the improvement of approximately $0.02 per share from our better than previously expected NOI, and a pickup of about $0.01 per share from lower total interest expense, will be offset by about $0.02 per share in increased dilution from slower and less acquisition activity.  And that will leave us at the end of the day, with a $0.01 net improvement to our annual normalized FFO guidance at the midpoint.  So now onto the balance sheet for a moment. In May, we were pleased to successfully execute on two simultaneous debt offerings. We issued $300 million of 30 year unsecured bonds at an all-in effective rate of about 4.55%, and this was our second 30-year debt issuance in the last year.  We also issued $450 million of 10-year paper, and that was at an all-in effective rate of 3.81%. Both these issuances were very well-received in the market. We saw tremendous demand, especially from large money market funds, desiring to invest in bonds from a high quality borrower like Equity Residential that issues larger and more liquid tranches.  Over the last two years, we have aggressively taken advantage of historically low long-term debt rates, and now have about 10% of our debt maturing in about 30 years. The weighted average maturity of our debt at about 8.3 years is among the longest in the sector, and matches up well with the long hold periods we expect for our new better quality assets. Our credit metrics are strong, and the balance sheet is in excellent shape. At the end of 2015, we expect to have about $460 million of outstanding commercial paper or revolver borrowings, and have availability under our revolver of slightly less than $2 billion. So Keith, we're now ready for the question and answer period. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we can take our first question from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Nick Joseph : Thanks. You highlighted the strong operating fundamentals and we've seen the strong growth. But recently, we've seen suburban sub markets outperform urban. So I'm wondering if you think that trend will continue, and what we need to see before urban starts to outperform suburban again? David Neithercut : I'm fascinated at this interest of the investment community, Nick, in what happened over the last 90 days. We remain quite convinced that -- and I think history has demonstrated quite clearly, that over extended time periods, the higher density urban markets have outperformed the suburbs. And when we think about performance, we mean about overall total return.  So from time to time, will different assets or different sub markets quote, unquote, outperform just in terms of rental growth? I suppose. But I think, over an extended time period, I think the total return on the higher density assets will do better. I think history has quite clearly demonstrated that. Nick Joseph : Thanks. Then just in terms of the development pipeline, it looks like you decided to add air conditioning to three of the developments which increased the total cost by about 6% in aggregate. Can you talk about that decision, and then what the impact is on the projected yields for those projects? David Neithercut : When those deals were conceived in San Francisco and Seattle, air conditioning was not really considered to be necessary for that type of product. But as more product has been brought to market there, and the expectations of luxury product have changed modestly, we came to the decision that we should add air conditioning. And was better to do so now under construction, than wait until these assets were completed. We think we'll get enhanced rents for having done so, but at the end of the day we think that they will modestly decrease the sort of stabilized returns, but believe over the long term hold, and over an extended total return on these investments that we'll at least break-even on that incremental investment or do better on it.  Because we think it's the right thing to do in those marketplaces today, that those residents of those markets have an expectation of that air conditioning, and that was something for us to do. So we believe we'll get an increased rent. It'll be modestly, just a few basis points dilutive on a stabilized basis, but we think it will be long-term accretive for the asset. Nick Joseph : Thanks. And just to remind me, what is the stabilized -- what is the targeted stabilized yield for those assets? David Neithercut : Well, generally those deals are in the 5s and 6s. So it would just be a few basis points off of those levels. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jeff Spector : Good morning. David, obviously some very positive trends and comments about the foreseeable future, and I know, of course, you're not providing 2016 guidance. But anything we can read into on your thoughts for 2016 on rent growth at this point? David Neithercut : Well, I guess, you can read into them what you care to read into them. I think in my quote, in the press release, my comments today, David's comments, we all feel very bullish, continue to be very bullish on the overall demand for housing, particularly in the high density 24/7 urban markets in which we've been focused. The demographic picture is very powerful. The job picture very good. We expect supply to be down in 2016, over 2015. So you can read into that, and we think 2016 which should be a very good year. Jeff Spector : Okay. And then on the acquisition front, the Boston unit acquisition. At a low 4% cap rate, you've discussed how the environment is tough to do deals. How -- can you just talk to us a little bit more about that particular deal at a low 4% cap rate, versus I guess, other things you're seeing that you're not as comfortable with to execute on? David Neithercut : Yes, we think that that was -- probably become probably our best asset in Boston. We believe that the lease-up by the seller had not been done ideally. We had the opportunity to maybe fix that a little bit. But we also looked at it as a trade if you will, with the sale of the medical office building also in Boston. And by trading the one for a mid-4%, and buying the other at a low 4%, it was a good trade and a good capital allocation decision. Assets today are trading in low 4%s, and 3%s in many instances in some markets. And we're just not -- we are finding other people being far more aggressive in acquiring those assets, and frankly, we just think every single day away from us, people are demonstrating the value of our portfolio, and demonstrating the true NAV of our Company. And that's okay. Jeff Spector : Okay. Thanks. And then last, on the development yields, you described DC, I guess mid-5%s, the rest mid-5%s, mid-6%s. Obviously, you're comfortable with those yields, with facing potentially higher rates over the next year or two. Is it that you're just -- you're not comfortable below that? I mean, are you still comfortable with the 5%s? I mean, at this point, of course, you have to execute. How are you thinking about those yields? David Neithercut : Well, we think that -- we're building at 5%s and 6%s in markets, that trades in the 3%s and 4%s. So we're fine with that. I think what you're seeing our actions today, is unwillingness to continue to buy new land sites at prices today, in which we believe development yields are in the 4%s. So we're comfortable in the 5%s and 6%s, again for the high density sort of urban locations that we've been focused on. So you'll see us continue to work through our existing land inventory, but you will see us, not likely adding a lot of new land at this pricing. Operator : Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS. Please go ahead. Nick Yulico : Thanks. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the supply picture. I think you said 2016, you see deliveries easing up a bit in your markets. Yet the June starts number for multi-family from the Census Bureau was higher than recently. So could you just talk about the supply picture as you see it today? David Neithercut : Sure. I mean, starts in 2015 are not going to result in deliveries in 2016. So as we look at 2016, we see -- and again, let me just sort of be clear. We're focusing on our markets only, and we track projects of 100 units or more, or even smaller within close proximity to our existing assets across our markets. Many of you have toured each of our properties over the years, and have met the professional teams we've got across these markets that are tracking this for us. We're currently tracking more than 1,700 units across all these markets. So as we track what will be delivered in 2016 in the markets that we're focused on, we believe could be competitive to our own product, we're seeing a significant reduction in new deliveries. And as we look at what is either under construction for 2017 delivery, and what we think could yet be started that could be delivered in 2017, we see levels around 2016 or a modest increase to that. So again, still well below the 2015s. Now, beyond that, who knows? We certainly are cognizant of some of those statistics that have been reported about permits, and we question how many of those will turn into starts. We note in Brooklyn, for instance, there was an elevated level of permits. But it was on so many projects, that the average unit per property was about 50 units, and disbursed over the entire borough of Brooklyn. We're not quite sure how impactful that will be on some of our properties. So we're watching the stuff. And we'll be cautious about 2017 and 2018, but as we look at 2016 we see, again a meaningful reduction across our markets. And again, as we mentioned, continued very strong demand. Nick Yulico : That's helpful. Thanks, David. One other question, you talked about acquisitions becoming more difficult, or as difficult I guess, as they've been. It sounds like you're also going to maybe start -- some less in the development next year. Does this point to a situation then, where the Board starts thinking about, if you don't have as many capital needs to have even higher dividend growth, and even more of your earnings being paid out for dividends? David Neithercut : I think the Board thinks about all these things. I think we've been very good stewards of capital, and very good capital allocators, and we'll be discussing all those things. And again, a reduction in acquisition activity by us, or a reduction in land take-downs and development is not an indication in any way of our belief that fundamentals aren't going to remain very strong for years to come. It's just pricing has got very expensive, and yields very low. We're happy with what we own, and don't believe we need to buy assets at these prices. And to your point, we'll consider lots of different options for capital allocation, given those dynamics. Operator : Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Good morning. David Santee mentioned in his prepared remarks, the generational shift you're seeing in urban demand, and not just in your markets, but across the nation. Are any of these cities becoming more interesting for you to enter at this point? David Neithercut : Any cities that we're not currently in? John Kim : Yes. David Neithercut : I would tell you no. As we -- and we've done a lot of work in looking at what's going on in -- across other markets that we don't currently operate in. And we just find that they don't stream well on all the important sort of things that we want to consider. Probably one of them, which is the most damming if you will is, the cost of single family homes as a multiple of income. There are markets in the country, Chicago, Minneapolis, others in which there's some very solid 24/7 cities, very exciting things happening in these cities, with millennial growth downtown, et cetera, et cetera. But as you look at single family home price as a multiple of income, they become very challenging to think of those being good long-term, and I want to stress long-term investment markets. I'm not suggesting you can't make money in those markets but I think one must do so with more of a trading mentality, and less of a long-term market. So we're focused on where we're at, and have no intention at the present time of deviating from that. John Kim : Okay. And then a question on development yields. AvalonBay mentioned on their call yesterday that they're seeing higher achieved yields than originally projected. I am wondering if you're seeing a similar dynamic in your projects, excluding the ones you reconfigured? David Neithercut : Absolutely. Anything that was priced a few years ago, land priced a few years ago, construction costs locked in a few years ago, are outperforming one's original expectation. I think that sort of almost goes without saying, but it just becomes more and more difficult, as pricing gets more costly. So certainly, anything being delivered today is at least achieving your expectations. Certainly, it's exceeding your expectations on market rents, at the time in which you underwrote it, and commenced construction. So we're very pleased with what we've got in the pipeline. I think we made a lot of money on that pipeline. The question is for us, is at what price or what cost you continue to probably reload that pipeline, and we've decided to take our foot off the gas. John Kim : So you're not replenishing the land as much as you had in the past on developments? Are you also seeing higher construction costs as well that are outpacing the rental increase? David Neithercut : Well, you're just -- well, I mean, by definition, yields are coming down. So you're having costs go up more quickly than rental rates. The product that we delivered, or started coming out of the recession is delivering 8%, 9%. And then several years after that we're sort of delivering 7s and 6s, and then 5s and 6s. And I said I think the product that we'd look at starting today, at pricing that we see coming to the market would be in the 4s. And so, we've made a lot of money on the product that we have already started, and have delivered or will deliver soon. But we've just elected not to start construction on projects today that we think would have yields of today's rents in the 4s. John Kim : Okay. And then a final question on downtown LA. It's been a very strong market for you, but there's a lot of new supply coming to the market. Is this one of the markets where you may look to replenish the pipeline, and maybe protect your market share? David Neithercut : We're not about protecting market share. We'll leave that to the automobile business. We do have a land site in LA, a terrific land site in LA, that we could start sometime in 2016. But we do like downtown. It's really one of the best-performing sort of markets. There is new supply there, but that new supply brings more density, and brings more restaurants and more things to do. I mean, it's kind of a self-fulfilling sort of cycle. We like downtown and we look forward to working on the project that -- the land site we already own in downtown LA that could start construction soon. Operator : We'll go next to Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Alex Goldfarb : Hey, good morning out there. David, just a question for you. You guys were vocal at NAREIT, you're vocal on the call, about the challenges of acquiring, both existing as well as land sites. And yet this apartment cycle seems to be going on longer than most people thought. As well as this year, it's got a second wind. So how do you balance the two between the cycle being longer, so therefore there's more opportunity to get a return on whatever you invest today, versus the fact that yields continue to come down, and are, as you point out, in the 4s even for development. How do you marry those two, and does that mean we should see EQR remain on the sidelines as long as yields are down where they are? Or do you think that something will break in the investment part that will make pricing come back to be attractive during -- yet while the cycle still continues to grow? David Neithercut : Well, I guess, you marry it, Alex, by just being happy that you're long, right? This pricing is -- it may be difficult for us to rationalize new investments, but it just validates everything we've been doing over the last 10 years. So when you're already long, this is a high class problem, right? Is it possible that with these elevated new deliveries, there will be opportunities to buy assets at prices that make sense relative to taking construction risk? Perhaps. We don't have to buy. We don't have to develop in order to kind of create value. I think the single biggest value creating tool we've got is David Santee, and his teams across the country. They have delivered unbelievable bottom line results for us, and have created enormous value out of the existing portfolio. So we admit that we continue to have assets that we rather sell, we'd like to sell if we could. But it's only if we can find the reinvestment opportunity for those assets. Absent those opportunities, we're happy to sort of sit tight, and operate what we have. We acknowledge that doing so is modestly more dilutive this year, than what we had originally forecasted. But we're quite content to allocate capital in the best way we sort of see fit, the opportunities present themselves. And with George and his team, I tell you they turn over every bush and rock, and beating every bush looking for a product, and remain optimistic that we will find stuff we can buy this year, at a little better yield, by maybe taking on some risk that we can uniquely manage, and we'll be comfortable managing. We'll see. Not the first time in our history. It's probably the sixth time or so in our 20 some odd year history, in which we've had relatively little transaction activity. And I guess, I'll tell you, that at the end of those lulls, we've always come back strong, and have created a lot of value in doing so. So we don't worry about marrying these things. It is what it is, and we're quite comfortable with our plan, and think that there will be opportunities down the road, and we'll patiently wait for them. Alex Goldfarb : Okay. And then, earlier in the call during the MD&A, you guys mentioned move-outs. But I wasn't clear, was that specific to one market? Or was that portfolio-wide the increase in move-outs? And if it was portfolio-wide, which markets were you seeing that mostly in? David Santee : This is David. Basically move-outs, the increase amounted to 600 for the quarter, and it's really broken down by three categories, half of the 600 were due to affordability, 150 were home buying, and the other 150 were transfers. So that's across the entire portfolio. Alex Goldfarb : Okay. And just finally for Mark Parrell. Anything else from Archstone out there? Any other either positives or negatives in the -- or are you guys totally done with anything Archstone related? Mark Parrell : Alex, it's Mark. Yes, there isn't a lot left. We've really wound down all the Archstone related joint venture activities. There's a little bit left, and we give you some disclosure of that towards the end of the preferred issuance. But it's really quite minimal. There could be minimal lawsuit costs, and master lease costs and stuff that run through for a little while. But I don't see anything significant on the horizon. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Oppenheim with Zelman & Associates. Dan Oppenheim : Thanks very much. I was wondering in terms of the move-outs and the affordability driven ones -- [indiscernible] up in the third quarter just based on more expirations coming through during the quarter, plus the way you're pushing rents here. Is there anything in terms of the -- what you're doing with the rent? Do you think it's sticker shock in terms of the affordability, or it is some negotiation where you might be able to manage the turnover a bit, and how are you looking at that overall? David Neithercut : I guess, we don't -- first of all, we don't manage to occupancy. We manage to an acceptable level of inventory to coming at it. We have, as we discussed before, we did a lot of work on moving a lot of the Archstone expirations that were kind of out of whack. So on average, we moved probably 32% of our leases from January through May, into June, July, August, so where the rents are higher. I mean, at 300 affordability move-outs across 400 properties across three months, I don't see any major concern there. A lot of that remains in San Francisco, where rents are still -- renewals are still double-digit. But as I said, there's just a long line waiting at the door to backfill those. As long as that's the case, we're not concerned. Dan Oppenheim : Okay. I guess, just relating to that in terms of the long lines or the duration of the cycle, in terms of the hesitancy in terms of pursuing acquisitions here, if you think that the long line persists for a while, would you be content to sort of try to find something here? So if we look back over time, we've had people make large acquisitions and talk about having a proud history of dilutive acquisitions, and then those turn out well, because the cycle continues. How do you think about that now in terms of managing it? David Neithercut : Well, I guess, the acquisitions are funded by dispositions. And so these are trades for us, and we're just unwilling to make the trade. And again, it just validates, I think that the value in our portfolio, and validates everything we've done to reposition this portfolio over the last 10 or so years. So if pricing is very aggressive in the urban core assets we'd like to own, we're already long in those markets and that's a good thing. We're just not willing to make the trade of the assets we want to sell for the relative value pricing of the assets that people are buying today. We think that that could become more attractive as -- based upon the elevated -- the new supply that we talked about a little bit. There may be more attractive trading opportunities for us a little bit down the road. But again, the fact that there are people out there willing to pay 3 cap rates for some of this product, I think says a great -- attributes a lot of value to our portfolio, and all that we've done. And we don't feel we need to continue to chase that pricing. Once you're already long, you're in good shape. Operator : Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Tayo Okusanya : Yes, good morning. Just along the lines of acquisitions, could you just talk a little bit about which markets you're seeing the most competition for assets for? And then specifically, who seems to be bidding assets up, so much to the point where some deals are just not attractive to you anymore? David Neithercut : There's a lot of institutional players out there that are buying assets. Big pension fund advisors, we're seeing life insurance companies, we're seeing some foreign capital. It's happening across all markets. I don't think that there's limited to just any one. You're seeing some people on land for condos, for instance, makes it difficult to rationalize multi-family rental on land. But in terms of existing sort of stabilized deals, big institutional players, domestically and foreign. See very little REIT activity. I think we're not the only ones who are suggesting that that transaction activity may be reduced kind of going forward, but very much domestic and foreign institutional investors. Tayo Okusanya : Got it. And then, with the slowdown in acquisitions and development, how do you kind of -- how do you offset that from an internal perspective, just to drive your historical earnings growth levels? David Neithercut : Well, again, let's understand about just kind of cash flow. Acquisition is really funded by dispositions, and our development kind of funded from free cash flow, and we've got development to fund over the next several years. And a lot of the growth, I mean, the lion's share of the growth, and I think more growth from us than from others is really being delivered, as I said from the property portfolio, the kind work that David Santee and his team have done. Drilling down submarket by submarket, asset by asset, we believe that we're outperforming many others. And in terms of bottom line performance and putting whatever multiple you want on that creates that incremental value, is significant, and we think is a much better risk-adjusted return, than aggressively chasing development at these prices or new acquisitions. So as I said earlier, this is not the first time/ I think there's been a pause for us in this activity, and every single time coming out of these pauses, we've been loaded for bear, and able to take advantage of a great deal of opportunity. So we're content to sit and wait and see what happens. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vincent Chao : Hey. I know we've had a lot of questions on acquisitions here. Clearly, it's a tough time to be buying. You've said you don't really have anything in the queue right now, and anything that's in the guidance is going to be back end weighted. Just curious why even leave the 220 in there. I know it's reduced, but given the conditions, why not just take that out of there as part of the guidance? But two, if for whatever reason you can't find deals that make sense, I guess what would be the sort of most natural use of the 220 that would have gone towards acquisitions? Would that be sort of debt repayment? I know you've got some stuff due in the early part of '16. David Neithercut : Yes, so I'll answer the first part of the question, and Mark can answer the second. I guess, what we've told you is that we reduced the acquisition guidance and have told you that it will be backend loaded and challenging. So I think that's sort of giving you the pieces of the puzzle the same way. We could take it down and tell you there's a chance we'll buy more or we'll tell you it's up and it will be tough to buy. So we figured you can get there on your own with the information we've given you. And as relates to use of proceeds, Mark? Mark Parrell : Yes. So just to be absolutely clear, we put it in so late in the year, that if the [$220 million] came through it would only be worth about $900,000 of FFO to us. So if it doesn't occur, we'll use it to pay down debt. We'll have, as I said a $460 million line balance, so we'll pay the line or the CP program down. That is not a particularly accretive use of funds. But again, as David Neithercut mentioned a minute ago, it just loads us up and prepares us for when opportunity does arrive. So the use of proceeds will be to pay down the line or the CP program in the short-term and in the long term to fund our investment activity, as we have done at other points in the cycle. Vincent Chao : Okay. And just one other question on the sort of the demand you're seeing. So move-outs are up, but you've got a lot of folks waiting to get in. Just curious if you have any stats on how the household income has grown on your move-ins say, this year versus last? Mark Parrell : Well, so we use the same qualifier that we used for 20 years. So when you measure the income of those folks coming in, they have to meet that qualifier. So really when you look back over the 12 months which is, we measure the previous 12 months move-ins, the numbers never change. And then, we have no means to measure incomes of people that have lived with us for three, four or five years. However, I think the important thing is that we have seen a tremendous improvement in the overall credit quality of the people coming in the door with 720-plus FICO scores. In summary, the rent to income will never change, as long as we continue to use the same qualifier. Vincent Chao : Right, right. I was more just thinking about the income side. Sounds like whatever rental rate growth you're seeing, you're seeing an equivalent increase in the incomes of the people coming in? Mark Parrell : Correct. Operator : We'll go next to Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors. David Bragg : Just to follow up on a key topic on this call. David, you seem to be providing a view on values in absolute terms, but don't you think about it on a relative basis? Are you saying that the spread has widened between coastal, urban assets, where you want to invest in your sources of capital, whether it's Denver or Inland Empire asset sales or equity? David Neithercut : Yes, I guess, what I'm saying is that the trade between the sale and the buy has probably widened. And because of that, we're less inclined to make those trades, particularly at the price -- I guess, what I'd say is -- at the stabilized assets in these -- the coastal markets yields, as I said in many instances are in the 3%s. We're confident that we can manage that spread, or have been confident, and hope we still can yet this year, by trying to find some things to acquire that aren't stabilized assets. But rather assets that have got maybe some lease-up risk, some completion of construction or some other things that might detour an aggressive bid from some of those institutions that will buy stabilized stuff, and provide us with an opportunity to buy something with a little better yield, which would narrow that spread and make a trade make sense for us. Operator : We'll go next to Derek Bower with Evercore ISI. Derek Bower : Great, thanks. Just wanted to circle back on operations. Can you talk about where new and renewals are in July, relative to where they were in 2014, just the spread that you're seeing? David Neithercut : So renewals, renewals as far as achieved were 7.2% for the quarter. For quarter two in 2014, we achieved a 5.5%. Derek Bower : And then, just how you do those numbers compare to 2014's level? David Neithercut : Well, Q2 of 2014 was a 5.5% achieved renewals. Derek Bower : Okay. Thanks. And then just knowing you have a tougher comp going into the fourth quarter, but assuming you hit the midpoint of guidance this year, how should we think about the potential earn-in going into next year, relative to the one you had coming into 2015? David Neithercut : Well, so Q4 of last year I think we averaged 95.8[%], 95.9[%]. We're probably not going to run the portfolio up to 97[%]. I think if you start leaving rate on the table, once you get up to that point, unless we see continued acceleration in the job growth. So if we see continued job growth above [250,000] and the formula for apartment demand has changed dramatically relative to home ownership. Then again, I'll just say 97 will be the new 95. I mean, we're not managing to 97. But if we continue to do the same things that we've done year after year, as far as rate optimization and managing inventory, if we achieve 97, then so be it. Derek Bower : And then, Mark, just lastly, any updated thoughts on timing of the refinancing, the 2016 and 2017 maturities? Mark Parrell : Sure. We've got a fair amount of debt maturing in those years. We don't now have any guidance, any thought of prefunding that. We will think about that. We will think about hedges as well, which we've done in the past. So right now, I you would tell you that we're sort of waiting to see the rate climate, and feeling our way through it. But I think we've been pretty proactive in dealing with those maturities. It's about I think a 5.3% rate next year that we get to re-fi to, so I think it will be a pretty accretive refinancing opportunity, and so we will be all over that. But right now, the guidance has no prefunding activities in it at all. Operator : Our next question comes from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird. Drew Babin : Going forward, as it appears dispositions will probably be -- or EQR is likely to become a net disposer over time, given where cap rates are on the acquisition market. And you mentioned that there's foreign demand for assets. Do you think the cap rates on your sales of apartment buildings may actually drift down as we go into '16 and '17, as you start to see maybe once in a lifetime type bids on some of your better assets? David Neithercut : I'm sorry, I missed -- not sure I got the whole question. Assets -- valuations of the properties that we want to sell? Drew Babin : Might we see kind of -- as you have already pruned a lot of your non-core assets, might we see some of your future assets, be sort of higher on the quality spectrum at even lower cap rates, versus what you've disposed of to date? David Neithercut : Yes, but I think what you have a chance of seeing is, we'll begin to sell lesser quality product in more of our core markets, and the possibility and the expectation that that will attract a bid of a better cap rate than that which we've realized in exit markets. So yes, as we work through exit markets, and we'll also sell -- I guess, as we did like the office building in Boston -- we'll sell lesser quality, non-core assets in our core markets. And that's another way in which we're trying to manage the spread between the disposition cap rate and the acquisition cap rate. Drew Babin : Okay. That's helpful. And back to operations, New York City, Boston and Seattle stand out as markets where, some minor deceleration versus last quarter on the revenue growth front, but also kind of versus your six quarter trailing average. Is there anything going on in those markets? Is it just kind of the supply being a disproportionately weighted towards where you're located? Is it rent fatigue? What are you seeing that might be behind that? David Neithercut : Well, so let's just take Boston as an example. A lot of the deliveries are probably within a one-mile radius of the financial district. We have six properties in that one-mile radius that delivers 40% of our revenue for the entire portfolio. So that's just an example as we've talked about, when we're going to see some head to head pressure and pricing pressure. And I think you just have such a concentration of properties in such a small area that you just lose pricing power. So in the case of Seattle, probably the same thing, a lot of deliveries in Belltown, downtown, CBD. When you look at the portfolio up in Bellevue -- I'm sorry, north up towards Bothel, Snohomish, those properties are far outperforming the CBDs just because of the magnitude of the deliveries. But still, the portfolio in Seattle is producing very good results. So I think it's just a matter of time to flush out these elevated deliveries that are very concentrated in some of these markets. No different than DC, where we have 20% of our revenue coming out of the RBC corridor, which is probably -- which is the most negative submarket that we have. So I think over the next year to 18 months as job growth improves, as new deliveries kind of start to dissipate and move kind of back out to the suburbs, I think you'll see the relative strength of these markets return. Drew Babin : And New York would be a similar story? David Neithercut : Well, New York is -- Manhattan is fine. I think you just look at our portfolio, and you look at Brooklyn, which is really dragging the portfolio down. We still have assets in the far outer burbs, down near Philadelphia, Fairfield, those are far underperforming. So I think when you break down a portfolio like New York, when you look at core Manhattan assets, those are performing better than expected and above historical trend. Operator : We'll go next to Neil Malkin with RBC Capital Markets. Neil Malkin : Hey, guys. First question. Given that we have been seeing pretty strong job growth for the last several quarters, and just recently we've seen an uptick in household formation, what are your thoughts on as we move forward into 2016, given less supply this year? And given, that we probably had a breakdown from that 5 to 1 jobs to apartment ratio has probably decreased, that we actually continue to see accelerated or higher levels of rent growth than we have this quarter, which kind of probably took a lot of people by surprise? David Neithercut : Well, I guess, we won't give you any sort of numbers. But we've been quite vocal for quite some time that even -- that the levels, elevated levels of new supply that we've experienced over the last several years would not destabilize these markets. That we were confident that the demand was there to adequately absorb this new supply, and not destabilize these markets. And I mean, to your point, we expect less supply in 2016, and continued good job growth, and the inevitable of income growth that kind of comes with that. This segment of the population is very interested in living in these high density urban markets. They either value the optionality and flexibility that provides rental housing, or can't afford single family housing in these markets, because it's significantly -- the multiple of those prices in those homes as a multiple of their incomes are significant. And that's why we continue to suggest, and believe that we're going to have above trend fundamentals for many years to come. So we see it the way that you've just described it, and continue to remain very optimistic about the multifamily business for the foreseeable future. Neil Malkin : If I could just add onto that. Given that lag between strong job growth and household formation, if we -- this decoupling continues to happen, do you think there's a good chance second quarter of 2016 would have better rent growth than this quarter? David Neithercut : We're not going to give any over-unders on growth that far out. But just suffice it to say, we feel very positive about fundamentals for quite some time. Neil Malkin : Okay. Last one from me is, given your comments on development being expensive, sorry, would you look to do things more internally, maybe ramp up redevelopment? Maybe do deeper turns or deeper type of redevelopment, or are there other kind of efficiencies that you could work on to improve organic growth, I guess for David Santee? David Neithercut : Well, yes, it's David Neithercut. I want to make sure I just define what we mean by our rehabs, which is really not redevelopment. There are others in our space who talk about redevelopment, as spending $40,000, $60,000, $80,000 a door. What we have done, and what we have accelerated is our rehab business, which I'll have Mark Parrell explain. Mark Parrell : Right. We give you a little disclosure on that on page 22. We spend right now about $9,000 per unit. These are usually kitchen and bath freshenings. We generally get a yield in the mid-teens on that, and those have proven to be for us excellent investments. I do think you'll see that ramp up. We didn't increase our guidance there, because we're still sort of in the formative stages of that. But I would expect we might spend closer to $65 million there, and do a few more of those rehabs. The cost is trending up for us. Not because cost items are increasing, but the scope of these rehabs are going up. And the places we're doing them, these high-rise units that we now own, just demand a higher level of finish. So you might see us have that number go up a little from $9,000 per unit to $10,000 or $11,000. And I think you'll see more volume there and more spend, because it's a great investment in these very well-located assets that we intend to hold long-term. We are doing one very significant rehab of an asset in LA. I guess, I will call that a redevelopment. We did take that out of same-store. We mentioned it in prior calls. We may do another. These are assets that are right on the beach. They're just terrific, we can't replicate them due to zoning requirements. But they do require more in the $40,000 to $50,000 a unit rehab cost, and that includes interiors and exteriors. So I could see us doing more of this sort of stuff, because our assets are so well located now. Operator : And it appears we have no further questions at this time, so I'll turn the program back over to our presenters for any closing remarks. David Neithercut : Well, thank you all for your time and interest today. I hope you all enjoy summer, and look forward to seeing many of you in the fall. Have a great day. Operator : And this does conclude today's program.",

Baird Aaron Hecht - JMP Securities Operator : Good day and welcome to the Equity Residential Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to today's speakers. Please go ahead. Marty McKenna : Thanks, Joe. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's third quarter 2015 results and our asset sale to Starwood. David Neithercut, our President and CEO will be our featured speaker this morning. David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer, and Mark Parrell, our CFO, are here for the Q&A. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. And now I'll turn the call over to David Neithercut. David Neithercut : Thank you, Marty and good morning everyone. And thank you all for joining us on such short notice. Because of the additional news we released this morning, we're going to break from our normal earnings call routine where we would go through prepared remarks on our markets, quarterly acquisitions, disposition and development activity. As a lot of comments on any capital market, balance sheet and liquidity topics. Instead I'm just going to make a few brief comments about first about the earnings release and then about the portfolio sale with Starwood and as Marty mentioned after that, we'll open it up for questions where Mark Parrell, David Santee will also be able to jump in with their insights. So, first as to our third quarter earnings release, in the last 20 years we've had only four years in which same-store revenue growth was 5% or better. And three of these have been in the last five years including 2015. And we've had only five instances in the last 20 years when annual same-store NOI growth was 6% or better and three of these have occurred in the last five years again including this year. And our current outlook for 2016 in which we've given an initial range of same-store revenue growth with a mid-point of nearly 4.9%. So, just the 2016 is expected to be yet another of extremely strong growth. And you\u2019ve heard us say numerous times since the recovery that we felt and were looking at an extended runway of above the trend performance and that continues to be the case. It\u2019s no secret the fundamentals remain very good, the demographic picture is incredibly favourable, the economy continues to improve, perhaps not at the rate many would like but improve nonetheless which is generating job growth again less than some might hope for, but the employment rate has continued to drop, which creates new households and millennials and have a high propensity to rent housing, many of which, which do so in 24/7 cities across the country that have very high cost of single-family home ownership. And this time we'll continue because even with the improvement in jobs and the growth in new households there still remain an elevated level of these young adults continuing to live at home with their parents. And I know, because I've got one of them myself and we're quite confident and in my case quite hopeful that they will some time, some day leave home and even create even more new households and those few households will be renters. If we see here today, occupancy has withheld strong and we're at 96.3%. Achieved renewal rates averaged 7% in the third quarter with October, November and December at 6.7, 6.1and 6.3 respectively. We're very excited about delivering 5.2% same-store revenue growth this year and same-store NOI growth of 6.2%. In addition, we currently expect normalized FFO to grow nearly 9% this year over last year. So, like every call we had with you over the last several years, we're pleased to tell you it remains really very good time to be in the multifamily business and we think we are extraordinarily well positioned to benefit from the continued strength and demand for high quality rental housing in a high-density urban coastal markets. And that leads me to the other release we put out this morning, regarding the sale of 23,000 units to Starwood for $5.365 billion. The decision to sell these assets was the result of a process we began late last spring as we were looking at a stock price that was trading at a meaningful discount to NAV. And we were assessing the best course of action. We thought about selling core assets, we thought about bringing some JV partners into some core assets. We kept coming back and kept asking ourselves about what to do with assets in those markets that we did not consider long-term core markets, and assets in core markets that might not fit our longer term strategic vision for the company. These assets would generally be described as older, mostly suburban in nature with limited access to public transportation services. The majority of which are surface parked, two to four storey walk-up garden properties not the high-density urban assets, but high walk scores that we've been focused in the past 10 years or so. And while we have historically considered all of these assets as warehouses of capital that could at some time or another be sold and reinvested into core assets. Overtime we became more and more concerned that recycling $6 billion of capital is going to be a real challenge going forward. Because of the strong institutional demand for core assets in gateway coastal cities and the competitive pricing that is a result of that demand causing very dilutive trade between what we wanted to sell and that which we'd like to buy. Yet we thought that absolute valuations of the assets we knew were not long-term pulls were quite good and if those valuations might be at risk by any upward movement in interest rates, as well as of any future changes in liquidity provided the multifamily space by Fannie and Freddie. So, we began to think that may be the best thing to do would be to monetize the value we have in these assets today and do a special dividend. And the more we thought about that the more we became convinced that it was the best capital allocation decision that we could make for our shareholders which kind of ironically is also very similar to what we\u2019ve seen take place in our space several times recently, associated states, home properties and campus communities kind of a partial go private for cash deal. So we talked to a handful of folks to be able to acquire a portfolio of this size and work with Starwood over the last few weeks to put a deal together that accomplishes several things for us. First, we realized a very good pricing on assets in markets not considered poor for us and on assets in our core markets that do not fit our long-term strategic vision. And the second thing we accomplished is that we can now focus solely on our strategy of owning, building and operating assets in higher density urban locations with close proximity to public transportation, job centers and other amenity subsidies have to offer. In the investor presentation circulated last night, you can see that our urban concentration increases 13% to a total of 78% as a result of these transactions, that our NOI for mid and high-rise properties increased 21% to a total of 69% and that our total walk score increased 9% to a score of 75%. And each of these another metrics, we clearly lead the multifamily space and our belief is that long-term risk adjusted returns in the urban core will exceed those in other markets. So in summary, fundamentals continue to be very strong and should remain strong for quite some time. We feel very good about how we are positioned going into 2016 and beyond. We are also very pleased to be able to monetize our interest in a large portfolio of assets that don\u2019t fit our longer term strategic vision of the Company in a single transaction and believe that returning this capital to our shareholders and delivering unleveraged internal rate of return of 11.1% is a good capital allocation decision, and by doing so in a leveraged neutral way, we retain a lot of balance sheet flexibility going forward. So with all that said, Joe we will be happy to open the call to questions. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors. Dave Bragg : The first question relates to the 5.5 cap rate, can you just confirm is that a forward nominal cap rate or something else? David Neithercut : That\u2019s our sort of forward 12 with about $300 replacement reserve Dave. Dave Bragg : And can you share a little bit more about the process itself including how big was the bidding tent for portfolio of this size? David Neithercut : Well again as I noted Dave we just talked to a handful of players that we thought demonstrate the ability to do a deal of this magnitude as well as the ability to move quickly on a deal of this magnitude and after a short period of time we decided to move forward with Starwood. Dave Bragg : And a question for Mark, can you just address the 2016 debt maturities? Mark Parrell : Sure, hi Dave. So the thought process is that let\u2019s say which is our name for this process will generate give or take $2 billion of cash that we will use to repay debt. So we may end up repaying the vast majority and probably will of our 2016 maturities. But we are going to undertake a liability management discussion and process and it may end up that we also do some later maturities as well and retire some of that debt. Operator : And our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Michael Bilerman : Yes, good morning. It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Nick. David I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about use of proceeds in the decision on the special. I think back to last summer when Taubman did their big fail, actually to Starwood as well and they sort of left the door open a little bit to potential acquisitions which they said were going to be very unlikely as given the marketplace but also the share buybacks and then ultimately to a special dividend which is what they ended up doing. We have seen a lot of volatility just this year in revaluations and I am just curious are you completely vetted to doing the whole $9 to $11 special or would you consider potentially one if an acquisition came up, doing an acquisition, or two, buying back stock? Mark Parrell : Hi Michael it is Mark Parrell I will start and I am sure we will get some supplement from David Neithercut as well. So as you know we bought back material amounts of stock before and we would do so again but this particular transaction had a huge amount of embedded gain in it and in order to keep the balance sheet by there any tax embedded gain and to do just a leverage neutral transaction really requires us for every dollar of sales to put about $0.35 towards our debt maturities. Our gain percentage here approaches 75%. So as you can see there really wasn\u2019t any room to capably or easily do a stock buyback with the excess proceeds. That said there is flexibility on the margin we certainly could do 10.31 transactions and tax free exchanges if we wanted to and if the opportunity presented itself. Michael Bilerman : And just out of curiosity did you look at stay count at all the number sort of shape up pretty well from a $5.3 billion perspective? Mark Parrell : We did not, no, not this time nor the last time, the first time I guess I should say. Nick Joseph : Thanks. And then this is Nick here. For the 2016 same-store revenue growth guidance that you gave does that exclude the assets in the markets that you are selling? David Santee : I think -- this is David Santee yes it's, the guidance should based upon [indiscernible] 240 units for next year which really isn\u2019t that just similar than what we're doing this year. Nick Joseph : Okay, so if so if you stripped out the assets that you are planning on selling what would same-store revenue guidance for 2015 be? David Santee : It would be about 10 basis points less. Nick Joseph : Okay, so it\u2019s like deceleration from call it 51249 roughly as what's assumed? David Santee : Roughly yes. Nick Joseph : And then just in terms of the market commentary are you able to go into expectations but do you see North California kind of the six core markets for 2016? David Santee : Sure. I can go around the whole in pretty quick let\u2019s start with Boston I think if you look at our Boston results I was a little bit bearish on our ability to achieve the three but I think if Boston had a great lease up I think a lot of the head-to-head competition has been leased up and so I'm a little more bullish definitely more bullish on this year and going into next year. New York I think is just New York, Manhattan specifically is going to be stable again this year it's our lead submarket I think 4.8 for the quarter then you jump over to Jersey City it's a 3.8 and then everything else is a 2.8 so Manhattan continues to be a strong steady market for us and we wouldn\u2019t expect anything different next year. Washington DC is still I would say bouncing along the bottom we are going to produce positive revenue growth we have in our guidance we factored in some modest improvement call it 100 to 150 basis points for next year. But really it's just about were the new product is how and what proximity is to current assets but DC we see deliveries are going to be 10 or less next year and with a lot of the chatter in the government sector yes it seems like DC has turned the corner and the largest sector of job growth best sector of job growth is professional services which bodes well for our portfolio. Seattle. Seattle we are expecting another strong year still a lot of companies regional headquarters moving to Downtown with Amazon continuing to produce profitability that bodes well for the urban core, Boeing is doing great, backlogs so we don\u2019t really see any change for Seattle next year and kind of expect very similar growth to what we have seen this year. San Francisco we are always -- we keep moderating with it's probably going to be less next year but we've been around the last four year so we are backing off a little bit in San Francisco, but certainly deliveries are not going to be an issue a lot of these deliveries are downtown so we kind of expect more the same out of San Francisco and then all of the total really is just been is going to be a plus five if not better market all three of those submarkets continue to just deliver solid steady growth there might be a little pressure in Downtown with the new deliveries, but that will be more than made up by the coastal communities like Marina Del Rey so to summarize it Washington DC would be in its own bucket next year, Seattle all the west coast markets will be in the plus five bucket and then New York and Boston will be in that 3% to 5% bucket. Operator : And we will move forward to our next question. This one comes from Nick Yulico with UBS. Ross Nussbaum : Hi. This is Ross Nussbaum here with Nick. David when you answer the process specially the assets. Did you also entertain selling the whole company or were you exclusively focused just on this portfolio? David Neithercut : This process was focused strictly on this portfolio Ross. Ross Nussbaum : Did any of the people you are talking to you try to make an offer or you just didn\u2019t go to tell them? David Neithercut : Conversation never came up. Ross Nussbaum : Okay. As I'm sure you might imagine some folks this morning are drawing some parallels to when Sam accepted the god father offer back in \u201907 for equity office. It seems pretty clear what you are doing here to focus on your urban CBD high rise assets. Is there a message that you want to deliver on Sam's behalf that you know should people be reading in somehow that is Sam going to call the market top the market twice in a row? David Neithercut : Well I don\u2019t speak for Sam but I think that in my opening remarks I think pretty much described what the process does and in my conversations for Sam on the matter. It was -- we achieved a couple of things we thought were very important here I think suggesting that this is Sam calling any kind of market call is sort of friendly because we are really not selling the company, we are selling a portfolio of assets and we remain you know firmly committed to what we are doing in the identity urban core market, so I think that\u2019s a little of a stretch. And I think this was just kind of a smart portfolio move and a smart capital allocation -- execution. Ross Nussbaum : Okay I think Nick\u2019s got a question as well. Nick Yulico : Just a question in terms of next year are you using a sort of tax playing strategy, pulling forward income from future year to -- that\u2019s going to affect your special dividend payment in relation fee sales? Mark Parrell : Hi Nick, it's Mark Parrell, we are going to pull forward somewhere between call it $300 million to $500 million of 2017 dividend into 2016 is what our base case model implies right now, as we get closer and get in the next year we will give you more details on that. But if you recall my prior comment in this call when I said $0.35 plus $0.75 well that gets you more that a $1 of sales proceeds and by pulling those dividends from \u201917 to \u201916, we balance the transaction out slightly lower the dividend and give ourselves enough cash to keep our debt metrics even. Nick Yulico : Okay and so the extent that you sale more, your net sale are more on top of what you have announced today, it would likely require more special dividends next year? Mark Parrell : I should be careful there. The thought process, the $3.8 billion projected dividend and the $2 billion projected debt pay down encompass all of the sales. The sale to Starwood today for a 5.365 billion as well as the additional 700 million and the reconciling item is wholesome costs which are actually relatively low sale cost and also $200 million to $300 million of 10.31 exchanges that we must do in 2016 due to obligations we have the various OP unitholders. Operator : And we will move forward to our next question from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : A lot of my questions have been answered but I guess two to David just in terms of kind of shrieking the footprint, this does do anything to kind of G&A should we be thinking about any kind of cost savings? And then secondly just where is your that process on development today, as we get later in the cycle and how do you think about maybe purchasing land today? David Neithercut : As to your first question Steve, yes we lose a little bit of efficiency both in property management and G&A as a result of this. We are able to scale up very easily very efficiently and sort of work sequentially when you go backwards but we think it's an outcome that is satisfactory just given the execution that we think we are getting. And then we talk a lot about development over the last few earnings calls and we sort of have begun to back away from really chasing land at current pricing, we did announce the acquisition of a couple of sites that will be assembled with the third cycle we had acquired previously this year, so we have done a little bit the land acquisition in San Francisco but generally we have talked about we have been adding land to our inventory at a much slower rate than what we have been putting into under construction and what we are completing. So after elevated levels of new development starts last year, in this year you could begin to see that reduce going forward. Operator : And we will move forward to our next question from [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Some of them have been answered already. I have got one or two here in addition. I\u2019d like to start on I guess the question on the portfolio of assets that you are selling and maybe some potential readers. As you mentioned in your comments, you have been conspiring to sell these assets for over a year going back to last spring, so I am trying to figure out if you are trying to tell us anything on what the market on either secondary market or suburban asset value set by selling these assets today, do you think that suburban or secondary asset values have peaked or at least the cap rates have stopped compressing? And then maybe some color on the differential between the IR for what you are selling versus the retained core portfolio? David Neithercut : Well I guess last spring was not a year ago, we are talking about more of a six month process, as opposed to a 12 month process. Unidentified Analyst : I think that\u2019s spring... David Neithercut : But I guess I know this is just a reaction to a recognition as I said in my remarks that we owned assets that we didn\u2019t think were long-term core assets, we were looking at a challenging market in which to redeploy that capital going forward as well as what we thought was a pretty descent bid, to own those assets today and so rather than treat these assets like we have in the past, where they were reservoirs of capital that we used to sell assets and redeploy that in our core markets we just didn\u2019t feel that might be a successful going forward and in fact the matter is that we are now very much firmly in each of our core markets and have got good portfolios and have got that good allocations in those markets and didn't have the need to take that capital and put in a market so as to achieve some kind of total. So whether or not we are $40 billion company with capital deployed across these sort of six coastal markets or a $35 billion of capital deployed across some six markets we didn't really map and so as we were seeing what we thought would be the private equity bid for these sort of assets, we thought that they tend to go ahead and see what we could achieve from that segment and if it meant a special dividend we thought that was okay. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, I appreciate that and then a follow up on the process itself, you mentioned that there is descent interest, you focused on a proven better to you felt with more certain to close and quickly close, curious if there was any negotiation back and forth on the price given perhaps some more limited group of buyers you're discussing and the size of the deal itself? David Neithercut : I mean, it was sufficient negotiation for us to get a price those acceptable to us at terms that were satisfactory to us and again it came together very quickly. Unidentified Analyst : Okay but to be clear, was there you need to have discounts given here to what you were expecting or the pricing came in spot on to what you were underwriting? David Neithercut : Again we're very pleased with the pricing that we achieved in the transaction and in the entire process. Operator : And we'll move forward to our next question coming from Ian Weissman from Credit Suisse. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys. This is Chris for Ian. I was just wondering if you could walk through each of the disposition markets and can you talk a little bit about the pricing and potentially cap rates on how they rolled up to the 5.5% overall cap rate? David Neithercut : Well I guess that the level of detail that I'm not quite sure that we're prepared to go into we've really looked to this as a portfolio. I am not sure this is a wide range of cap rate spread between the individual markets but we've really looked at this not as a collective individual assets at one large portfolio. Unidentified Analyst : When we look at the overall portfolio Orange County and San Diego kind of stick out as the submarket assets but are less than other suburban in Sydney asset plus and the company, did you have any thoughts of selling or downsizing those markets and I guess secondly, was there any other assets that you're trying to -- when you're negotiating on the sale that you would like to have included in the disposition? David Neithercut : Southern California is sort of buyers nature mostly suburban I mean, all of California of our assets, are really we have got some Downtown San Francisco, we have got some Downtown LA but generally if you look at the difference between what I've said, with our urban concentration and what was that, it is not high rise or mid rise that's really a lot of California. So no, we did not consider selling anything more in any of those markets. And we sold everything in this portfolio that we wanted to, the only things we did not included in this portfolio, those assets that we've indicated in the release this morning that we intend to sale during the balance of 2016 which we thought weren\u2019t necessarily additive to this portfolio but would be a better execution in a one-off small portfolio like execution throughout 2016. Operator : And we'll move forward to our next question from Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jana Galan : David, maybe following up on those comments, I'm curious whether you would think the private market is giving portfolios at premiums or discount and maybe why you chose to earmark those assets for a portfolio and versus the 26 assets were you looking to do individual or small portfolio sales? David Neithercut : Well I guess, I want to tell you, that we are obviously satisfied with the execution of this pricing and we had an expectation that we get good pricing just because of the activity we've seen in the marketplace and we did want to go through a lengthy process of trying to sell these on a one-off sort of basis. I mean, this makes sense in a one big portfolio that we can than think about a onetime special dividend and just have the whole thing sort of makes sense, this would have been a very difficult process to achieve any other manner and we do not believe, we had to get anything on pricing in order to get it done in one fell swoop and we're getting a -- very satisfied with the overall pricing. Unidentified Analyst : And David, this is Jeff, just one quick question. A key focus for us has been the rise of secondary cities and I'm just curious, if EQR is messaging here making a statement that EQR does not really believe in the longevity of the rise of the secondary cities, let's called them the coming 24/7 although realistically, there is not that many 24/7 cities in the world but I understand your strategy and it's consistent what you've said, just on these other markets is it just not something you believe in long-term? David Neithercut : What I think all these markets are really good apartment markets Jeff. We really do, we think Denver is a good apartment market and we think Sao Paolo is a good apartment market. What we've been unable to sort of see our way into owning these sort of higher density kind of assets in those markets and believe that the suburban garden likes product that we're selling to Starwood are better owned by people that have a different capital structure than we do and then our focus has been toward owning what we consider to be more forever like assets in the high density urban core are better assets in our capital structure. So, I think that these are terrific markets. They've been doing very well. I think they are a little more susceptible to supply over the longer term and we think that within our capital structure the launch from this adjusted returns will be better in the urban core than in a suburban product. Operator : And we'll move forward to our next question from Tony Paolone with JPMorgan. Tony Paolone : Can you talk a little bit about what you think the longer-term delta is between the NOI growth in your six key markets versus say these assets that you're shedding here? Just seems like in the short run it's not that appreciably different, wondering longer term what you think? A - David Neithercut : Yes and look as David indicated I have been selling these assets would actually be dilutive to 2015 same-store revenue growth but if we think about total return over an extended time period and if you think about what are real cash and cash return of these assets would be as opposed to just kind of a cap rate, it's less than this level. And we also think that the -- there's more width to value of these assets as I said during my opening remarks with respect to rising interest rates or any change in liquidity that Fannie and Freddie provide. So, this is like simply a call about long-term revenue growth although I do believe that history will prove out that the urban core has over an extended time period done better in longer term top-line and probably bottom-line growth but it's also just I think a little bit a hedge about potential valuations and we just think is the right longer term per se. Tony Paolone : And, Mark, I think you went through this and I'm probably going to make you repeat this for a second. But the 2 billion in cash available to repay debt next year, that's inclusive of the Northeast assets that you intend to sell? Mark Parrell : Yes Sir. Tony Paolone : So, we should think about is like 6.1 billion producing the 2 billion of cash roughly? Mark Parrell : Yes, so just reconstruct that for you, the sources and uses so call it about 6.1 billion of sales proceeds call it around 300 million that we have to reinvestment in assets, we have to do tax free exchanges for us so that reach a 5.8 billion. When you try and solve backwards to keep your credit metrics about constant than needs up that 5.8, 2 billion will be used to repay debt and about 3.8 billion will remain for the special dividend, there're some immaterial costs and rounding in there as well, but it's not significant though. Tony Paolone : And then last question on the 4.5 to 5.25 revenue guide for '16. Can you put some just maybe broader economic brackets around that in terms of what kind of job growth do we need to see to kind of come in at the higher end or lower end of that range? And perhaps maybe what's in the bag at this point from the earn in just trying to understand the sensitivity around that right now? Mark Parrell : So, we kind of think about it in very simple terms. So we have about 2.3% embedded growth in our rent roll and we think just like this year that the new portfolio will see rent growth in the call it 5.5 you need to figure that the easy math as you get about 45% of that which is 2.5, two or three quarters and so 2.3 embedded, 2.5 to 2 and 3 quarters gets you to 495. We're not underwriting any additional pickups in occupancy although that certainly could be the case if the markets continue to tighten but as far as forecast for the next year, we're just kind of holding occupancy flat. Tony Paolone : And so, does that imply to that job growth in your six key markets needs to equate something fairly comparable to '15 to kind of hit that similar top-line number is that fair or is...? Mark Parrell : I would say as long as we hover around 175 to 200 jobs that we'll be just fine. Operator : And we will move forward to Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Alexander Goldfarb : So quick questions here, Mark, the common dividend, should we anticipate that getting resized or you guys will maintain it? Mark Parrell : As we said in the release just to be clear the dividend that we are going to pay in January that will be declared in December won\u2019t be affected by this transaction, whatever the trustees\u2019 do for that but it won\u2019t be affected by this transaction. I would expect this resize the annual run rate dividend that would be then payable in April of 2016. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then you guys in the market with one year apartment towers here in New York to a condo converter. Are your thoughts to contemplate other condo conversion sales? David Neithercut : So we are offering for sale a property in the East side of Manhattan which we think is one that I would lend itself better to condominium type ownership and this is the kind of activity I think you will see us more do going forward Alex and we are now focused solely on our core markets and here is an opportunity we think to monetize hopefully good value in this asset and redeploy that into something that might be a better longer term rental play. So I mean if possible we will see what happens. If we don\u2019t get a number, we realize we won\u2019t play, if we do it will be because we think it\u2019s a good price a good value relative to how we think we can redeploy that capital into another asset either in New York or in one of our other core markets. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And just finally, the military assets it seems like that one would be sort of next for this division but don\u2019t know if there is anything contractual or tax or anything like that, that would make it stay within EQR, so future of the military assets? David Neithercut : Well we have no contractual obligations to continue to do that to sell those require some approvals, from lenders and the army. So if and when that happens, it would be subject to their approval. We have no contractual obligation to continue for any length of time, of our management and ownership of that asset. Operator : And we will move forward to Rob Stevenson with Janney. Rob Stevenson : Mark, I know you used 300 of CapEx in the cap rate calculation. But on a real dollar basis, what\u2019s the maintenance CapEx per unit on the sales portfolio versus EQR as a whole for \u201915? Mark Parrell : We don\u2019t have that level of detail right here in front of us I don\u2019t think. David Neithercut : So I can tell you though that on a forward sort of run rate the 5.5 cap rate of this portfolio we think after CapEx is more like a 5.3 so on a real sort of AFFO basis Rob. Rob Stevenson : And then is there anything that you are sitting here today that you guys see hitting same-store expenses materially over the next five quarters other than the typical property tax and wage growth that\u2019s going to drive you much above the sort of 3, 3.25 run rate on the same-store expenses that you guys have been averaging recently? David Santee : This is Dave Santee. Here is how we think about 2016 taxes. We know that -- I am sorry expenses. We know that 2016 real estate taxes are going to have a 5 handle primarily because of the step up in the 421(a) tax abatements. We know that payroll should probably come in 3% or less. We know that we\u2019ve already locked in material discounts and some commodity costs for next year. So those three categories make up 70% of our total expense. So when if you do the math on that there is no reason why 2016 shouldn\u2019t look very similar to 2015. Rob Stevenson : Okay. And then last question, you talked a little bit about development earlier on but when you are in terms of the shadow development pipeline the stuff that\u2019s not ready to start yet. I mean how big is that today that you can envision starting over the \u201916, \u201917 period? David Neithercut : As you know it\u2019s not as big as what we\u2019ve done in the past several years Rob. In \u201916 we start call it $500 million or $600 million I suppose, and I think that\u2019s a pretty good run rate for us going forward. Operator : And we will move forward Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Vincent Chao : Just a quick question going back to the assets that is for sale in New York that\u2019s above and beyond the set of 100 that\u2019s contemplated in \u201916 I believe just curious given all the commentary about how difficult it is to deploy, what would be the most likely use of proceeds there and for any other sort of condo type conversion or other asset sales similar to that and what do you think that the best use of capital is today it sounds like starts are coming down so I mean developments will be part of that but I'm not sure if that's really will be able to absorb all of that? David Neithercut : While the difficulty to redeploy the capital I was really relative to the yields that we would realize on those assets we want to sell and so this is the 5.5 cap rate transactions deal with Starwood difficult to think that we could redeploy that at a reasonable relative cap rate seeing it how assets is our core markets today generally trading with a three handle if we are successful upon getting the bid that we hope we could keyed out of the market on a deal New York we may actually be able to redeploy that asset accretively in one of our core markets. So our expectation of current time is that that is what would happen with the proceeds if we are successful selling this particular property in the New York City. Vincent Chao : And then just going back to the 700 million of dispositions six in a quarter cap rate on those relative to the 5.5 for the Starwood portfolio assuming that's just general geographies that you are selling being different as well as some asset quality but curious is there any embedded assumption of just general cap rate increases in that 6 to 6.25 given some of the about the noncore nonurban assets you mentioned being more a price sensitive? David Neithercut : Now so to this end this difference shows cap rate has nothing to do with an expectation of a changing cap rates between now and then it's just simply a recognition or it is different type of property that would likely trade in a slightly wider cap rate. Operator : And will move forward to our next question from Dan Oppenheim with Zelman & Associates. Dan Oppenheim : I was wondering if you can just talk about the your view in terms of volatility as you now focused on to fewer and fewer market probably and it's more volatility into the results but I guess as specially in terms of this area here in terms of North how you think about that in terms of the exposure going up we have seen extremely strong rent growth as it's been you are delivering couple of more projects and here plus buying more land sounds that you are more bullish although the comments were about thinking of it as going to moderate a little bit here how do you think about the market overall? David Neithercut : Yes. We don\u2019t suggest for a minute Dan that San Francisco does not have its ups and downs and in fact it\u2019s probably had perhaps more downs than other markets but we do recognize that it is a marketplace that has always come back and come back fairly quickly and established sort of new so when we look at the assets where we own there and look at the asset that we are building and the prices per foot per pound that we are building those units we ask ourselves not how do we feel about this asset assuming these trees continue to go to the sky or how do we feel about owning these assets at these levels for the next 25 or 30 years and with that perspective we are quite comfortable with what we own and comfortable with what we have underway as a present time and again this was not mean that things can't stop from that marketplace we've not underwritten them again with these kinds of year-over-year revenue growth that we've seen over the past half a dozen years. And we just think that over the longer term it's -- these will be good assets to own. And I just so to mentioned that when we build the tower in Brooklyn half of dozen or so years ago when that deal was delivered it was maybe worth what it cost to good but we knew on firm was the great asset we are located and we do very well with anyone when the market stabilized we do work very well with it and it is worth a considerable premium today if were to cost build on I think we can take the same approach on really on anything that we build we look at the location, look at the quality of product what we are basis per unit per square foot in and ask ourselves how do we feel about being in this product over an extended time period not just are we going to ramp merchant builders right we are just not worried about what the spread is 24 months after delivery but it is the right asset for us and for our shareholders over an extended time period. Operator : And will move forward to our next question from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Rich Anderson : Mark Parrell you said 300 million you are obligated to sell or buy through 1031 exchange what are the tax protections are lingering in the remainco portfolio after the sell if any? Mark Parrell : Yes. I should have been a little more precise Rich with that. We are obligated we\u2019re inclined to 1031 that $300 million just because of the implications it has to us in our OP unit program we don\u2019t have to. We have relatively few assets that are covered and I think that would probably be something between around 30 after this transaction and might have some sort of obligation maybe a little bit less of one kind or another where you would need to do some sort of tax free exchange or you would have some amount you owe to your partner. David Neithercut : Let me follow-up on that just a little more Rich. I do want to make it clear that these are unrelated unaffiliated OP unitholders but would have taxes in the 100% very significant tax and we feel that inclined as Mark said to the limited amount of this particularly relation to the size of this transaction to try at 1031 those vehicles and we are quite confident that we will be able to do so in assets that we will be really delighted own over the long term. Mark Parrell : And just to finish the thought I mean we think that protects the OP unit currency, if you are able to take care of these partners even when you don\u2019t have to we think as we go out and trying do more and more deals that you have OP unit components because we do think it's attractive to do that certain place in the cycle that that will be appreciated by the market and by our sellers. Rich Anderson : And so David another you mentioned these are markets not necessarily grow to your markets over the long term that you are holding but just better from a perspective of 25 years, so you were saying like as the environment changes, interest rates go up these coastal barrier markets you just think will perform better or what is the reason that it's not about growth? David Neithercut : I wasn\u2019t clear I guess then, and while I was thinking about in terms of absolute value with respect to interest rate. Rich Anderson : Okay. David Neithercut : You said in our in the materials that we sent out as part of the press release, that there is a good bid for these assets today from leverage buyers taking advantage of lower interest rate, so I think that these assets as I have mentioned earlier are better owned I think by a leverage buyer and as favorable debt today at favourable rates and should that change we think we\u2019d see a bigger impact on value here, but if you would if any in the higher density core markets we have had the most for capital in investment today. Rich Anderson : Did any REITs get involved in the process for the asset sale? David Neithercut : We did not have any conversations with any other REITs. Rich Anderson : Okay and last question, you mentioned the 700 million to go will be kind of one offish or a smaller portfolio, is any chance of that could actually give more sense to a single buyer situation? David Neithercut : I suppose it's possible, we\u2019d probably be delighted if that were to occur, but just given the nature of these assets and for those of you who have been around the blog for a while, these are a primarily assets and we acquired in a growth transactions so there are a lot sort of smaller assets or smaller unit out, smaller price points that we think that we might achieve maximum operable pricing and on one off sort of basis, but if there were someone who are interested in meeting our expectations on a one off deal we would be go delighted for that to happen. Operator : And we will take our next question from Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities. Tom Lesnick : So on the 700 million, knowing when the portfolio for next year, I think like you guys are pretty confident on pricing and have a pretty type band there on cap rates, I was just wondering how far along you were in the market process for that and if you could offer any commentary on timing for next year whether it is probably more weighted towards the first half or second half or whatever? David Neithercut : I guess, we had several of these assets sort out in the marketplace before we really got on the way with this larger process but we have a good sense of pricing. And then also just sort of to tell you that we are acted in the markets, following deals and so we just a kind of very good handle on what we think valuations are, I\u2019ll remind you that when we announced the Archstone transaction, we have given our Boards the guidance just to we thought, we\u2019d achieve and selling the $4.5 billion of assets and we used during the 1031 trade in Archstone we sold those at something like 99.7% of our expectation, so we have got a terrific team out there that are in these markets every day, taking care of these assets trying to understand them and understand the marketplace and we just have a high regard for the intelligence that these guys give us and expectations to what we will be able to achieve on this portfolio. Tom Lesnick : And then on the land acquisitions in San Francisco, just curious if you could shed some color on where in the city those are exactly and when you might expect commencing of those development starts? David Neithercut : Well, this two sites have been assemble with a third site and we have clearly that we acquired earlier in the year and are adjacent to our SoMa Square in the SoMa sort of submarket on San Francisco. The expectation there is that we can begin to start in maybe in the first quarter of 2017 that will be $170 million project. We love Downtown in San Francisco, we think it will be very well with that transaction. Tom Lesnick : And then most of my questions on the Starwood transaction have been answered at this point but just a housekeeping question. Looking back at your 2Q supplement the asset count and unit count is slightly different than what's presented in the transaction said actually in the market, I think you guys had 19 assets in Denver and 35 assets in South Florida, I just want to what the couple of assets there were that were the difference? David Neithercut : Yes well following up on Rich Anderson's question I answered a moment ago, there are few assets that are tax protected or are JV assets in Denver and in South Florida and that\u2019s the difference in the count and those will be sold or dealt with separately over the course of 2016. Operator : And we'll move forward to our next question from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay : Congratulations on the transaction and thanks for providing individual look in 2016 and when you look at 2016, which markets were the hardest to forecast? David Neithercut : Well, I guess by default Washington DC. We were starting off the year with pretty much flat embedded growth so anything we achieved will have to earn next year either through rate or occupancy. Wes Golladay : Okay and then for the transaction the asset dispositions, is there any deferred CapEx associated with that transaction price? David Neithercut : No. Operator : And we'll move forward to our next question from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Tayo Okusanya : Just along those same lines with the 2016 same store revenue guidance. Could you just talk a little bit about market where you actually think you should see better same store revenue growth in '16 versus '15 and markets where you actually expected to slow which I mean where you kind of rule everything else becomes the slight slowdown versus overall 2015? David Neithercut : Well so the markets that we think, we'll do better would be Orange County, potentially LA and Boston and potentially New York and DC. Seattle, I think is not less but closer to the same and then San Francisco, we hope that will do the same but we're just cautious about forecasting any gains over this year in the next year. Operator : We have another question from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird. Drew Babin : I was hoping you could in more detail for example what you're seeing on the supply side in the markets that you're exiting on '16 deliveries across the board higher than they're in '15 or is it more of a long term issue? David Neithercut : And those that we're exiting? Drew Babin : Correct. David Santee : Well this is David Santee. Denver is delivering over 12,000 units this year and I would tell you that we would expect a good portion of that to bleed into next year with a lot of concentration in the downtown area. Then for 2016, as of today our forecast already gross down to 6,500 units but when you're talking about garden communities, there is no lot of barriers temporary in Denver and the 6,500 number could grow to 7,500 or 8,000 very easily. South Florida really is almost the same picture, 10,000 plus units being delivered again in 2015. I think what is different in South Florida is that a lot of these new deliveries are pretty much all along I-95, if not all east of I-95 stretching from Miami all the way from West Palm Beach and then very similar to Denver, we dropped down to 5,500 for 2016 but again with the lower barriers to entry permitting what have you to scrape and build two storey, three storey garden walk up can be done very quickly in those markets. Drew Babin : And secondly, you're just talking about kind of this is the broader cycle, I was wondering if you could highlight the key differences between now time period versus going back to 2005, 2006 and cap rates seem to be kind of in the same place or even lower than they were at that point in time, what are the key differences that you're seeing sort of on the supply side or relationship versus that cost things like that? David Santee : That cost are about the same, there continues to be a great deal of equity, chasing deals, it might be less absolute leverage available but there is still a lot of them at that very attractive rates. Operator : And we have another question from Aaron Hecht with JMP Securities. Aaron Hecht : I was just wondering if you could outline your NOI exposure by market following these dispositions? David Santee : NOI exposures [indiscernible] we're digging for that but hold on just a second. Aaron Hecht : No Problem. David Santee : And this is after all the expected dispositions. David Neithercut : Completing the Starwood transaction and the 700 that will occur later in the year. David Santee : So, we expect and I would say these are all kind of grounded numbers around New York to be around 20% of NOI, maybe a bit more, Washington DC to be in the 19%, San Francisco to be about 18%, LA about 15%, Boston give or take 11, Seattle about 8 and then the rest really San Diego and Orange County each 4% and that's just about it. Little bit less than Inland Empire that are likely be included the next time we report next year in our Los Angeles country that is around the far west and really are driven by West co -- by Orange County or LA more so than the Inland Empire. Aaron Hecht : And then just, we all saw the article in the Wall Street Journal about the partial volumes increasing based on Web services and there are some quotes from you guys in that but just wondering what you're take is on how that's impacting expenses in NOI? Does this become a bigger issue now with the dispositions given the higher exposure to mid and high rise buildings? David Santee : This is David Santee certainly, there is a much bigger burden on garden communities, because they don't have doormen, they don't have concierges what have you so, I mean we evolved in working my partner at hand and we've been at conversations with UPS and FedEx and what have you but we've had a very -- we build a proprietary package notification system probably four or five years ago. Is it a burden on some of the properties? Yes. We have tried several pieces of technology which are only real partial answers to the problem, but I think over the next year or so we will be close to providing 100% solution in buildings where we don't have concierges or doormen but we do believe that if you live in a doormen building or concierges building that accepting packages is a basic expectation of our resident. Aaron Hecht : And is there a solution in those other buildings electronic lockers is that what you're trying to? David Santee : No, I think I don't want to think we've ruled the lockers out but there is a lot of nuances with the lockers. When someone orders four tyres they don't fit in one of those lockers. And remember it's all these unique jockeying between the kinds of postal person FedEx and UPS guys or whoever may jockey for last position for so and hoping that the lockers are filled so that they can just dump the packages. So, it's a very interesting subject that, that we hope to solve over the course of the next year or so. Operator : And we have a follow-up question from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Michael Bilerman : Yes, it's Michael Bilerman, just a quick follow-up. Obviously, as a seller you are most concerned with the buyer's ability to close and fund the transaction. I'm just curious as I assume this is going to be a leveraged transaction. How much have you already been working with Starwood in terms of the debt financing and what can you tell us about that today? David Neithercut : Yes, all I can tell you Michael is that we've done the appropriate diligence that we would need to do on a transaction with this magnitude with respect to equity sources and debt sources to give us great comfort that they will perform as expected which would be very similarly to the way they've performed over the last several weeks between the time we sort of agreed on doing this deal and today announced. So, they have done everything they've said they would do and we've done our diligence to get us comfortable, we're able to continue to do that and close on time as we expect. Michael Bilerman : Is there any financing contingency at all in the transaction? David Neithercut : No, sir. Michael Bilerman : And then I noticed there was -- the deal was on a ten separate person and sale agreements and the closing is in seven different buckets. Can you just talk about what the rationale or is it are they slitting it up to multiple equity partners and their different leverage profiles and their different buckets, is it timing in terms of getting it that package, what drove that? David Neithercut : Mostly it is because of some properties that we acquire, some consents and approvals, there are some rights of first offer that some county has, there's also our desire, the properties that Mark suggested, that that we would want to temporarily want to have ourselves gated and we\u2019d get a little bit of extra time that need be. So, a little bit -- the lion\u2019s share of this will happen in one fell suit and then there will just be and even in those multiple buckets could be at the same time but we just a way to sort of facilitate the overall transaction and allow for some of these other consents and approvals to be able to see. Michael Bilerman : And is there any G&A savings at all even few million dollars that we should be thinking about as we are modelling through what the company is post the $6 billion of asset sale? Mark Parrell : It\u2019s Mark Parrell Michael. At this point what I would tell you is we run a pretty tight ship already and I think Dave Neithercut spoke to the scaling comment it was relatively easy for us to scale up to Archstone which does imply it\u2019s really relatively difficult for us to just suddenly scale down. So at this point wouldn\u2019t have you project anything meaningful. Operator : And at this time, we have no further questions in the queue. David Neithercut : All right, thank you all again for your time today and look forward to seeing many of you in Las Vegas in just a few weeks. Have a great day.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Please go ahead. Marty McKenna : Thank you, Angela. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's fourth quarter 2015 results and outlook for 2016. Our featured speakers today are David Neithercut, our President and CEO; David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer, and Mark Parrell, our Chief Financial Officer. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. And now I'll turn the call over to David Neithercut. David Neithercut : Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We have got a lot to go over today and we will start with David Santee providing some color on operations. Talk a little bit about how last year ended up, a discussion on our core markets and our overall outlook for 2016. I will then discuss the acquisition and disposition activity that we are planning this year that will be in addition to the recently completed $5.365 billion sale to Starwood. And finally, Mark Parrell will take you through how our operating outlook and transaction and other assumptions impact our 2016 earnings guidance, our regular and special dividends, our recent debt repayment activities following the Starwood sales and liquidity. Now before we get started, I want to make a couple of general comments because we all read and listen to the same things the rest of you do and we know that there is a lot of volatility around the globe and across the financial markets. And there a lot of questions about how that is currently impacting or might soon impact the domestic economy in general and our business in particular. Because there have also been some reports of increasing apartment vacancy and declining rental rates. Like you, we don't have a crystal ball. All we can tell you is what we are seeing real time in our business and what we're seeing is some markets are a bit behind where we had expected at this point and others a bit ahead. But in total portfolio wide, we are where we expected to be one month into the year with 30 days forward visibility. And as in recent years, renewals tell a lot of the story. Renewal increases in November, December and January were all plus 6% and we will also achieve plus 6% growth in renewal rents in February. Portfolio occupancy today is 96.1%, very much in line with our expectations and quite strong for this time of year. All in all, we are pretty much right where we thought we would be when we gave our initial guidance for 2016 back in late October. So with that said, I will let David go into more detail about our markets, our current outlook for 2016 and why we think this year will be another good year for the apartment business and for Equity Residential. David Santee : Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. During Q4 turnover continued to decline with the quarter-over-quarter reduction of 7% in gross move-outs. For the full year turnover declined 40 basis points from 54.9% to 54.5% and then net of intra-property transfers turnover decreased 50 basis points to 48.5% from 49%. Our continued focus on minimizing Q4 and Q1 lease expirations continue to produce more operational stability as occupancy once again remains stronger through the historical Q4 seasonal slowdown. Moveouts to buy homes increased only slightly across many markets for the quarter and the full year. With rents continuing their rapid ascent across most markets, it should come as no surprise that affordability, our second-largest category for moveouts, increased from 13% to 14.1% for full year. Yet demand for quality apartments in great locations has remained steady thus far. Similar to 2015 we again we start the year from a solid foundation of occupancy, exposure and pricing levels across most of our markets. Today occupancy, as David mentioned, is 96.1% and exposure is 20 basis points lower with the net effective new lease rents up 3% year-over-year versus same week last year. While not the record setting renewal increases we enjoyed in 2015, we achieved a 6.4% increase on our January offers and February will deliver in the same range. These early indicators coupled with continued favorable job growth, fever deliveries on our core markets but more importantly the submarkets that we operate in, gives us the confidence to stand by our preliminary revenue guidance range of 4.5% to 5.25%. However, we are mindful of the headwinds from the headlines and the potential odds and impact of the U.S. economy entering a recessionary environment. Our 2016 revenue guidance is available by the West Coast with San Francisco leading the way followed by Los Angeles which continues to show momentum in both new lease and renewal gains. Our 2016 buckets of revenue growth again include San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle and the remainder of Southern California, all expected to exceed 5% revenue growth for the full year. Boston and New York Metro remain in the 3% to 5% bucket as concentrated new supply in each of our submarkets continue to dampen pricing power for new leases. Washington DC once again remains in a bucket of their own but we have projected revenue growth of 1% to 1.3% for full year 2016. Our total portfolio assumptions based on 75,123 same-store units that drive the midpoint of guidance, our 2.3% embedded growth from 2015, 3.5% average new lease rent growth and 6% average gain on renewals. Occupancy and turnover for 2016 are modeled to be flat. Expense results of 2% for the quarter were extremely favorable versus our forecast of 4.3%. Even with our optimistic adjustments that were made prior to our last earnings release, we were unable to predict the full impact of a commodities route and record temperature which allowed us to deliver full-year expense growth of 2.5% versus guidance of 3.1%. The two drivers of the 230 basis point pick up or approximately $4 million in Q4 were spread almost evenly between utilities and payroll with the unseasonably warm weather materially influencing both. The rapid price decline across all relevant commodities combined with record warm temperatures through December allowed us to beat our original forecasted savings almost threefold for the quarter, resulting in an additional $2 million pick up across heating oil, natural gas and electric. Also, the warm temperatures combined with a 7% decline in Q4 moveouts allowed us to achieve our historical salary forecast but the need for contract labor and overtime was virtually nonexistent. This in addition to favorable employee bonus and health insurance accruals allowed us to achieve an additional $1.7 million in payroll savings for Q4, bringing our forecasted total of 4.3% down to the 2% for the quarter and 2.5% for the full-year. Expense guidance for 2016 of 2.5% to 3.5% is once again driven by real estate tax growth of 5.25% with 190 basis points of that 5.25% attributable to our New York portfolio 421 tax abatement burn of. Like 2015 we would expect minimal growth, if any, across the utility accounts. Payroll should come in between 2.5% and 3% and all other account lines will so flat to minimal growth as the impact of increased minimum wages and Affordable Care Act cost incurred by our outside vendors are already absorbed into our cost structure over the past two years. So, going around the horn and starting with Seattle, I will give some brief market highlights, some revenue expectations and expected delivery, that combined influence our thought process for a full year of 2016 revenue guidance. Seattle will see an 8% decline in new deliveries from a little over 9000 units in 2015 to approximately 7200. Knowing that Amazon will continue its large capital investment and delivery of almost 4 million square feet of new office space in downtown and the continued migration of regional and corporate headquarters from the suburbs, Seattle should be able to absorb this new inventory with minimal disruption just as it has done over the past two years and as evidenced by the 3100 units that have been absorbed over the past two quarters. San Francisco will once again lead all EQR markets and constraints to new development are all around. However, like any market where there is a concentration of new supply, near-term pricing pressure will always follow. As a result of the new deliveries in the urban core, pricing has appeared to revert to normal seasonal patterns with net effective new lease rents up only 4% today. As expected, properties closest to the urban core are experiencing the most pressure why properties further down the peninsula continue to enjoy year-over-year rental rate growth in the mid teens. With lease up velocity exceeding normalized expectations, San Francisco Metro should experience rapid absorption and deliver another year of high single digit revenue growth as evidenced by our year to date billings that exceed 9.6%. While headlines are quick to recognize the slowdown of DC tech spending, the large-cap giants continue to buy, lease or build new office space in anticipation of future growth and elevated hiring. But as we all know trees don't grow to the sky but our dashboard tells us that fundamentals remain strong. Renewal offers issued through March remain in double digits and if history plays out, we would expect new lease rents to seasonally adjust up from the mid-single digits we see today, to higher levels as we move closer to peak leasing season. With embedded revenue growth of 5.5%, renewal rates achieved averaging almost 10% and new lease rents everything 7+ percent, for the full-year we would expect our portfolio to deliver full-year revenue growth in the high single digits. Los Angeles fundamentals appear to be coming on strong with the anticipation of a breakout year for the LA economy and the pro-business city government, the rebranding of downtown as a world-class city coupled with meaningful additions to infrastructure and transportation cause us to be very optimistic in LA's ability to absorb the 7600 new deliveries expected in 2016. Given the concentrated nature of deliveries in the South Park and Hollywood submarkets, we see no major hurdles to strengthening fundamentals in revenue growth as net effective new lease rents are up 7.3% with both occupancy and exposure significantly better positioned versus the same week last year. Orange County in San Diego should continue to see about average growth with 2016 deliveries of 3600 and 2400 respectively. These levels are on par or slightly less than 2015. With the concentration of assets delivered during 2015 being in Irvine and in close proximity to a large percentage of our assets, we would expect to see better results in 2016 as pressure on new lease pricing subsides. Our Boston portfolio continues to face pricing pressure as 2015 backloaded deliveries remain in lease up. With only 2200 deliveries scheduled for 2016, which is a 62% decline and a lower concentration in the financial district and downtown, we would anticipate a window of improvement late this year and early into 2017 before an estimated 5000 units are again delivered in 2017. To date 19,000 units have been absorbed in the past two years without the disruption that one might expect. With GE announcing their headquarter relocation and the continued biotech related job growth, Boston should deliver results very similar to what we achieved in 2015. For New York Metro we expect to deliver 3% revenue growth as new supply certain submarkets. After delivering average annual revenue growth of 4.9% for the last 16 quarters, the performance of our Manhattan portfolio will be greatly influenced by almost 2000 new units on the Upper West side which makes up almost 30% of total revenue for our New York Metro area. Most of the projects are luxury with unit mixes that skew towards two and three-bedroom apartments and of late have been more difficult to lease and as a result ends up with a greater economic vacancy loss. While occupancies remain above 95% we expect Upper West side new lease rates to be flat or slightly positive until a majority of these new deliveries are absorbed. We continue to see strong fundamentals in pricing in our other Manhattan submarkets, the financial district, Gramercy and Chelsea. Collectively these neighborhoods should deliver revenue growth in line with our historical averages that I noted earlier. Another New York Metro hotspot is Jersey City or the Hudson waterfront where over 1000 new units were delivered in late 2015 and another 1500 expected in 2016. All concentrated in one to two mile radius. Thus far we have not felt the full impact as year to date revenue growth is holding at 3%. Brooklyn will also deliver a number of new buildings but these are north and further east of downtown with the new supply being smaller in unit count and less desirable based on amenities and location. We would expect moderate impact in Williamsburg and less so in downtown Brooklyn as both EQR communities in this location are delivering in excess of 4.8% revenue growth through February. Again, as new supply comes online in concentrated areas, new lease pricing will be under pressure and we see that in our net effective rents today. However, occupancy remains strong across the portfolio at 96.1%. Renewal rate growth should average plus 4% for the portfolio that combined will produce full-year revenue growth of approximately 3%. Washington DC will experience declines in deliveries to approximately 11,000 units in 2016 after absorbing over 28,000 units in the previous two years. With positive revenue growth in Q4 and full-year we are cautiously optimistic about near-term performance. Should absorption maintain its velocity, DC should begin to deliver more favorable revenue growth as new lease pricing pressures ease. With job growth in the professional services sector continuing to improve, an increase in DC business activity as a result of the election year and more of the 2016 deliveries in the suburbs versus Arlington and DC, we continue to be optimistic about the long-term performance of our portfolio. In summary, we continue to see favorable fundamentals across all of our markets. At this point in the apartment rental cycle it is much too early to be influenced by the negative headlines that we all read each and every day. We remain focused on what the data tells us and we will respond appropriately. Today our dashboards tell us that not much has changed in that apartment fundamentals, at least for the first quarter remain strong leading us to believe that 2016 will be yet another year of performance above long-term trend. David Neithercut : All right. Thank you, David. We are very pleased to have recently closed our sale of 72 non-core assets totaling 23,262 apartment units to Starwood for $5.365 billion or $231,000 per unit. I am particularly pleased to realize an 11.1% unleveraged IRR on these investments inclusive of indirect management costs over an extremely long hold period. This sale was a result of an incredible effort by a lot of folks here at EQR who worked practically around the clock to get this deal done. And I thank all of them for their dedication and commitment. And I also thank those who left the company with the sale of this portfolio. Some of them have been with us for more than 20 years. We are most grateful to all of these people for their service to our residents and the company. On our last earnings call when this transaction with Starwood was first announced, we explained that this disposition accomplished several things for us. First, we realized very good pricing on assets in markets not considered core for us and on some assets in our core markets that didn't quite fit our long-term strategic vision. The second thing we accomplished is that we can now focus solely on our strategy of owning, building and operating assets in higher density urban locations with close proximity to public transportation, job centers and other amenities that cities have to offer. As we have discussed with many of you since the original announcement, this sale and the sale of $700 million of additional assets in 2016, would result in a special dividend of $9 to $11 per share. And that decision was made due to the challenge we saw trying to recycle $6 billion of capital in today's marketplace where we continue to see strong institutional demand for core assets in Gateway coastal cities and very competitive pricing as a result of the demand. We continue to believe and are grateful for the support of so many of you who did agree with us for returning much of these proceeds to our investors through a special dividend in a balance sheet neutral way is the best capital allocation decision we can make on behalf of our shareholders. Since our original announcement of the Starwood transaction, demand for multifamily assets in our core markets has continued unabated and so we have considered the sale of several additional assets that due to either operational challenges or submarket issues, or pricing potential that we simply thought too good to pass up, might represent additional timing opportunities to monetize our interest in certain assets and modestly increase the size of this year's special dividend. Last week, for instance, we sold one of three assets acquired from the Macklowe family in 2010, when we paid a total of $475 million for the entire portfolio. This particular property, RiverTower was sold for $390 million, or $1.2 million per door at a yield in the low 3s, for a five-year unleveraged IRR inclusive of indirect management cost of 14%. This sale was previously contemplated and was accounted for in our original special dividend guidance of $9 to $11 per share. In addition, we have also started work on the potential disposition of another $600 million of possible sales that if consummated could increase the dividend by another dollar or so per share and hence the new range of $10 to $12 per share noted in last night's press release. I want to be publicly clear because I am sure many of you will have questions about this. We backed up the truck once with the sale to Starwood, we have no intention of doing so again. And as I have said, we are working on a limited number of additional sales yet this year that could bring our special dividend up to the $10 to $12 per share. Our guidance also assumes that we will sell an additional $300 million by the end of the year, 100% of which would be redeployed in the new acquisitions. And that level of activity is accounted for in our guidance towards the back half of the year at a negative yield spread of 75 basis points. This additional $300 million of activity will only occur if we can find suitable investments for which we are willing to trade out of current assets. So the guidance provided in the press release is for $7.4 billion of dispositions comprised of the $6.1 billion we announced last October, nearly $400 million for RiverTower. Another $600 million expected to be sold during the year adding an additional dollar per share to our special dividend and $300 million of sales that will occur if and only if we can suitable reinvestment opportunities. Our acquisition guidance for $600 million is roughly $300 million of 1031 reinvestments to cover some very large tax gains of certain unaffiliated limited partners as a result of the Starwood transaction and $300 million of additional possible acquisitions in the back half of the year and matched up with dispositions in the normal course of managing our portfolio. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Thank you, David. I want to take a few minutes this morning to talk about our guidance for 2016 that includes both the annual dividend and the special dividends, our recent debt prepayment activity and then I will close with a discussion of sources and usage in 2016. Our range for normalized FFO for 2016 is $3 to $3.20 per share. This range is larger than usual due to some of the uncertainties over transaction timing. I am going to walk you through some of the bigger highlights at this point. The biggest reconciling item between 2015 and 2016 normalized FFO is of course the reduction we will experience in net operating income of about $345 million, that's about $.90 per share, from our transaction activity including Starwood. The second big item going the other way is the use of approximately $1.7 billion of those disposition proceeds to prepay debt. That creates an $80 million or $.21 per share benefit or improvement in interest expense. I will pause here and note that we are expecting about $10 million decline in capitalized interest in 2016 versus 2015 and I did include that in the $.21 per share improvement number that I just gave you. So once you get past the transaction and debt activity, our normalized FFO is driven by the usual suspects. And that includes an increase of $.23 per share in same-store NOI and an increase of $.12 per share from lease outs. And the final items are just a variety of other individually less material items that reduced our normalized FFO estimate for 2016 by about two cents per share. And they include, among other things, lower income from unconsolidated entities and that's due to the sales in 2015 as the last few Archstone JV operating assets. So this brings our normalized FFO guidance midpoint for 2016 to $3.10 per share. So now I am going to move on to the dividends. For the annual dividend as you know, it is our intention to pay 65% of the midpoint of our normalized FFO guidance as our annual common share dividend. Given the midpoint I just discussed of $3.10 per share, we would expect to take $2.015 per share for the year or 50.375 cents per share per quarter in 2016. Also we expect to pay two special dividends which will total between $10 and $12 a share. The first special dividend is anticipated to be paid in the second quarter and is expected to be about $8 per share. There is less variability in our minds about the size and timing of this first special dividend, given that the Starwood sales and some of these other sales have already occurred. But of course our board of trustees retains discretion on all dividend matters. The second special dividend has been modeled in our guidance at $3 per share based on our existing disposition guidance number as well as numerous assumptions we had to make about the exact timing and amount of the gain per asset and our 2016 operating income and other tax variables. Similarly, the timing of the payment of the second special dividend is less certain in our minds and we will like the amount of that dividend ultimately depend on when these sales close, the number of sales that close and certain other tax variables. Now on to the bond tender and our other recent debt repayment activities. Consistent with what we have said on the earnings call back in October, over the last two weeks the company has prepaid prior to maturity a total of $1.7 billion in debt through an unsecured bond tender and early repayment of a large secured debt pool. In mid-March we also repay using the cash we now have on hand. The $270 million of March 2016 unsecured bonds that were not tender. Collectively, the company will incur approximately $112 million in prepayment penalties and that will be recorded as additional interest expense in the first quarter and it will impact EPS and FFO but will not impact normalized funds from operations. These debt repayment activities were funded with a portion of the proceeds from the Starwood sale and our other recent sales and are intended to maintain and they do in fact actually slightly enhance the company's already strong credit profile. We now expect net debt to EBITDA for 2016 to be about 5.8 times and fixed charge coverage to be about 3.6 times and this compares for our already strong 2015 net debt to EBITDA ratio of 6.1 times and fixed charge coverage of 3.5 times. And I am computing all these fixed charge coverage ratios using the more stringent rating agency methodology which does not reduce interest expense by capitalized interest. Also, our near term maturities are now greatly reduced and in fact we currently have only approximately $330 million of debt maturing in 2016 consisting of $60 million in secured debt that matures a little later in 2016 plus the $270 million of unsecured notes due in March 2016 that were not tendered as I discussed previously. Our 2017 maturities have now been cut in half and now total about $600 million. The company's liquidity position is excellent. Currently we have $3.5 billion in cash and our $2.5 billion revolving line of credit is undrawn. We also have no commercial paper outstanding. At the end of 2016 we expect to have about $50 million in cash and the revolving line of credit and the commercial paper program between the two will have about $300 million balance. And that is certainly a lot of inflows and outflows in one year. So I am going to take a minute and just give you a little background on that and the bigger pieces. For the full year 2016 we expect net inflows from buys and sells of about $6.8 billion. To date we have sold approximately $5.9 billion which is inclusive of Starwood and we have not acquired any properties. We have assumed paying about $4.25 billion in special dividends. As I just said we expect to pay the first and in second quarter of 2016 in the amount of about $30 billion, and the second later in 2016 in the amount of approximately $1.25 billion. We anticipate repaying approximately $2.1 billion in total debt during 2016. As mentioned earlier, we have already retired approximately $1.7 billion. We further expect to spend about $250 million during the year. That\u2019s mostly for the prepayment penalties I referred to previously and about $40 million or $45 million of transaction cost on the dispositions. We expect to spend about $600 million in development activities during 2016 and the final piece of the puzzle is positive cash flow from operations of about $200 million. And that $200 million number is net of our annual dividend and our capital expenditures. In order to balance our sources and usage, we have included in guidance a $200 million to $250 million borrowing later in 2016, which we have assumed will be a secured loan and we expect to have the revolver drawn or to have CP outstanding equal to about $300 million. And I will now turn the call back over to Angela, our operator for the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Nick Joseph : David, I appreciate your comments on the uncertain macro environment but from your comments it doesn't sound like there's been a large impact to the transaction market. So, I'm wondering if we were to enter a recession, how do you think asset values would hold up in the gateway markets versus the secondary markets? David Neithercut : Thanks, Nick. Good question. Look I think that history has demonstrated that these gateway market asset values hold up better and recover more quickly. I think we have experienced that certainly through the last recession and the markets in which we are focused today we saw rent recover quickly and surpass the established new highs and values perform similarly. So we are quite comfortable and confident that we are in the right markets for the long term and think we are in the markets that will perform and should outperform if there is any sort of recession on the horizon. Nick Joseph : Thanks. And with all the asset sales, the same store pool is changing considerably in 2016. It looks like it's about 70,000 units. So I'm wondering if you can give, for the 2016 same store pool, what their revenue expense and NOI growth was in 2015. Mark Parrell : It's Mark Parrell, Nick. It was broadly similar. Revenue was slightly lower as you might guess from losing Denver which was a strong market. But it was within a couple tens of a percent of the same numbers we reported for 2015 for the existing same store set. Nick Joseph : Okay. So, you're not expecting, for those existing same stores, there's not much of a deceleration expected in 2016? Mark Parrell : Correct. David Neithercut : Not relative to the 2015 same store -- what would be the same store [indiscernible] Mark Parrell : So comparing the 93,000 units in 2015 to the 70,000 we expect in 2016, there is no meaningful difference in our lines. Nick Joseph : Okay. Thanks. And then, finally, for the same store buckets that you laid out earlier, have any of the market outlooks changed materially since you gave the preliminary guidance three months ago? David Neithercut : No. I would say that we when we go through the budget process that we just wrapped up and Mark reviews, I would say that some started off the year a little differently than we expected but we still feel that full year results are intact. LA is definitely much stronger than we expected. Orange County, San Diego is much stronger than we expected. San Francisco starting off a little slower than we expected primarily due to just some of the lease ups and the impact on the closer in assets. But everything else is really right where we thought it would be. Operator : We will now go to Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Maybe David Santee, could you just comment a little bit more on San Francisco? It's clearly a market that has captured everybody's attention. Just curious if you're seeing anything in terms of just the leasing activity, traffic, roommates' situation, just any color that you could offer. I can appreciate the difference between the urban core and maybe the Peninsula. But just any more color you could give us around that market, what you're seeing in terms of future renewals and traffic coming in would be great. David Santee : We've spent a lot of time over the last week or so as we went through budgets. Traffic really remains identical to last year. Our level of applications, which is really the canary in the coal mine, are identical to last year. I think San Francisco, we looked at rent growth on a property by property basis. I would tell you that some of the other developers have different philosophical approaches to lease ups and different tactics that are probably not warranted in my opinion relative to the strength of market, but nevertheless we will have to deal with that. Anecdotally, I can tell you that we've had a graphic design guy that's been at equity for probably 14-15 years, that took a job in San Francisco and basically he's renting a couch in someone's apartment because there still remains a housing shortage and I think this temporary dislocation given the seasonality of the market will repair itself over the next 30 days. Steve Sakwa : Okay, thanks. And I guess just a follow-up question on New York. I noticed on the development page that both of your New York properties had relatively slow leasing and I can appreciate the comments you made about the Upper West Side and maybe the 170 Amsterdam project is falling victim to some of the oversupply on the Upper West Side. But just anything you could comment on in New York. Are the developments, were they below your expectations and if so, what do you attribute that to? David Neithercut : Well, the recent activity I guess is attributable to a couple of things Steve. Number one is, just, you would have less activity in the fourth quarter, particularly in lease up. So I wouldn\u2019t read too much into the fourth quarter statistics or recent statistics on lease up. The other thing that happens is that when you get in to the later stages of leasing up a building, you have less inventory. And so you are less able to accommodate everybody who walks through the door. You can imagine people walk through the door early on. You have got all the ones, all the studios, all the twos and can accommodate from a wider price range and whatever product we have. Now you are getting to a point where you have got less inventory in particular ranges and you may not be able to accommodate everyone. So it just will naturally slow. And on the Upper Westside as you know, it's being impacted by other deliveries and we have larger units either sort of with the inventory yet to lease at our Amsterdam deal and that would also just take more time. But all in all, we have been very pleased with those assets. Have been thrilled with the value we have created there and they are going to stabilize and will do extraordinarily well for us. Operator : We will now go to Nick Yulico with UBS. Nick Yulico : First, Mark, on the guidance, I wanted to see if it was possible to just get a range for the total NOI in dollars for the portfolio this year? Mark Parrell : A range total NOI in dollars. Nick Yulico : Right. If you don't have it immediately available, I can maybe just wait on that. And then, secondly, can you talk a little bit about, it looks like you guys may have purchased or in contract to purchase an asset in DC, which I don't think you've done for a while. Could you talk a little bit about what was behind your thinking there? David Neithercut : Well, as we noted back when we announced the Starwood transaction, we had close to $300 million of 1031s we were going to have to do to cover some set gains for some unaffiliated investors. And so a property became available for sale in DC in the [U Street] [ph], 14th Street corridor, that we thought we could buy at an attractive rate, at mid-4 kind of cap rate. And we thought it was a good trade and would be a good asset to cover. We can obviously have a big operation in DC and the guys saw that it represented pretty good value. So walk score of 99 in that very highly desirable marketplace for the demographic that was living in the city. Mark Parrell : If I could just revert back on your question. So for 2016, and this is total NOI so this includes our projected acquisition NOI, this includes a few weeks of Starwood, I mean this is just the totality of it, between $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion would be a good number. Operator : We will now go to Gaurav Mehta with Cantor Fitzgerald. Gaurav Mehta : Just a couple questions on your investment activity. So the additional sales, $600 million and then $300 million at the end of the year, where are those assets located? David Neithercut : Well, the additional transactions that we had first announced that we would do in addition to the Starwood transaction are generally sort of in Connecticut and Massachusetts. So it's the residual assets that we acquired with the Globe transaction back in the late 90s. The other properties that, in addition to that, was the RiverTower transaction, which I noted, we did in New York. And a couple of other properties in California that we are considering selling, that are in various stages of that process. And then of the $300 million that I have talked about, that would be disclosed if and if we can find appropriate trade assets. My guess, so you will see a little bit here and a little bit there. There's been nothing specifically indicated at this time. Gaurav Mehta : Okay. And then the 75 basis point CapEx spread is narrower than the 100 basis points you have been doing for some time now. Is that expected to continue or is it just for this year reflecting the quality of assets that you're selling? David Neithercut : Yes. I guess I can't tell you what that spread will be going forward in the normal course of our business but, yes, it should certainly narrow because the assets we will be trading in the future in the normal process of managing our portfolio will be assets in our core markets. And those will trade at a tighter cap rate to the assets than which we would acquire in those trade markets as opposed to selling assets in the secondary, kind of non-core markets that we have been selling over the past half a dozen or so years. So, yes, it will be a narrower spread than historical. I don\u2019t know exactly 75 or not but certainly much more narrow than what you have seen in the past. Operator : We will now go to Dave Toti with BB&T Capital Markets. Dave Toti : David, a quick question for you on the strategy of shrinking the company. And I guess along the dimensions of, at what point does it become a structural change? And are there any associated G&A impacts or internal management realignments as you go through the year on the dispositions? David Neithercut : Well, I guess the strategy has not been to shrink the company but to rather take advantage of what we thought was very strong pricing on assets that we knew we didn't want to own, it did not make sense for us to own long term. In terms of any sort of change in G&A, so there were no -- not a big structural sort of change. There might be some little changes that may have to occur but you won't see a big structural change as a result of selling what we have sold and what we intend to sell over the balance of the year. Dave Toti : Okay. And then my second question just has to do with your thoughts on the acquisition market. I guess more specifically, what would have to change in the environment in the second half of the year to make acquisitions more attractive from your perspective? Would it just be simply pricing or change in the capital environment? David Neithercut : Well, I guess, David, the investments are really a function for us of -- the acquisition market is a function of the disposition market. So it's where we believe we can trade and where we can acquire assets relative to the prices at yields at which we can dispose of assets, which represent the capital for that reinvestment. So we are just really working both sides of that equation. There are times in which the bid-ask spread is sort of wide and you won't see us transact. You will see others in which it narrows and we think it would be an advantageous time to transact. So I think that\u2019s really the answer to your question, is it's just how we look at the value of what we want to buy relative to the value of what we want to sell. Operator : We will now go to Andrew Rosivach with Goldman Sachs. Andrew Rosivach : To set this up, Mark, when you said the 5.8 times debt to EBITDA, is that assuming 16 run rate kind of run rate EBITDA with growth on it. And the debt is net of all the transactions that you guys are announced and planning? Mark Parrell : Yes. So the EBITDA number is what our true 2016. So it does include a little bit of Starwood income we won't have next year. It does include the growth and the debt is the year-end number. Andrew Rosivach : Got it. Okay. So, it's not like a perfect run rate to run rate. Mark Parrell : No. But I would expect 2017 not to be dissimilar to that 5.8 or to be slightly better, given what we expect on growth. And the fact that we have also effectively covered all our liabilities for a bit. Andrew Rosivach : Got it. So here's what I was going to ask. If you look at UDR today, they've got a three year plan that actually implies their debt to EBITDA will be even lower than this, actually half of where they were in the fourth quarter of 2009. We've had kind of your distant cousins, if you will, in student housing just recently very dramatically take down their debt to EBITDA even lower than your planned levels. Massive dilution associated with doing that but the stocks have actually behaved very, very well. And I guess my big picture question is, do you think that public REITs need to dramatically change their leverage relative to where they've been historically? David Neithercut : Every REITs got to look at its business model and particular volatility of its income, and we look at ours. You have got a pretty diversified portfolio. You have got debt maturities, we got very little maturing in the near term. And you have got interest expense coverage approaching four times. I mean you really have outstanding metrics in every regard here and the unencumbered pool at our company is the secret not so secret credit strength. We have about, even after all the sales this year, about $1.2 billion of our NOI that I quoted earlier, is unencumbered. And that just gives us huge flexibility. So we think here, when we talk to our board and we discuss this, we're always interested in making sure we are comfortable defensively and position so we can do things offensively. And honestly with the liquidity we have and with the access to the kind of channels of capital we have, I feel very comfortable with these numbers. Other people with different platforms and different volatility, their income streams probably need to be lower. We also have relatively little development, because of that again we can run the balance sheet in a different manner. So I think it's kind of a custom, no one-size-fits-all. It's just applying thoughtful principles to whatever your strategy is and whatever your income stream is. Andrew Rosivach : Well, in your back pocket you can do $1 billion equity offering, dilute your earnings, and your stock will probably go up. Thanks for taking the question. David Neithercut : Well, people did that in 2009 and it only lasted for a little while. Andrew Rosivach : It feels a lot like that. I understood. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : We will now go to Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors. Dave Bragg : Can you spend a little time talking about development? What are your thoughts on the appropriate level of development for you at this point in the cycle given your cost of capital? And what are your plans for development starts in 2016? David Neithercut : Well, after starting an average of $1 billion in each of '13 and '14, we I think communicated pretty directly and quite early to the Street that that number would come down, and it did. Starting only 375 or so million in 2015. And deals that we could start if we feel the desire to do so of similar amount in 2016, Mark's guidance assumes about $350 million of starts. So as Mark noted in answer to the last question, we have seen our development exposure come down considerably. Land is very expensive. Construction costs are up, yields are down and as we look at the yields that are available in the marketplace, we just don't think they make sense for us. We are also not inclined to go further out into the suburbs in order to sort of chase yield because our strategy is to be focused on the urban core. We think that the total returns will perform better in the urban core than in the suburbs. So there is not a function of us saying we want this amount as a percentage of our equity footings on our balance sheet or that percentage. We just look for opportunities and when we find ones we think make sense for us, we will not be shy pursuing them, but they are just getting more and more difficult to find. We did acquire some sites in San Francisco in the SoMa district last year, three properties which were assembled. And we will work on those going forward and we will see those might be a potential 2017 start. But we've been quite clear, I think, for quite some time that after an elevated level of starts in that $1 billion range as a result of the land sites that came to us in the Archstone transaction, that that number would likely come down and indeed it has. And we are happy where we are. If we can find opportunities that we think makes sense for more, we will be happy to do more. But I don't see us for some time ever getting close to the $1 billion start rate that we saw in '13 and '14. Dave Bragg : Okay, great. Thank you for that. And the second question relates to CapEx. What are your expectations for CapEx spending in 2016? Mark Parrell : Hey, Dave, it's Mark Parrell. I am just going to refer you to page 23 where we have our CapEx guidance. So what we have done is we have expected, and this is on the 70,000 unit set that will be our new same store we think by the end of the year. That we expect to spend about $2200 per unit. This year, this year being 2015, we spent $1800 effectively. But that was on the 93,000 same store unit set. So what we have done is we have tried to think about this as a percentage of NOI, as a percentage of revenue. And with the company's new higher rent per unit and new higher NOI per unit, when you look at 2200, that\u2019s about 7% of same store revenue for the new 70,000 units and about 10% of same store NOI. And that\u2019s exactly, really exactly identical to the $1801 we spend as a percentage of the lower same store revenue per unit and lower same store NOI per unit. So really proportionally it's about the same but on a per unit basis it goes up just like our per unit rents are going up. I would say it's our contention that over time high rise and mid-rise on a capital basis will cost less as a percentage of NOI than running a garden portfolio. That contention will play out over a longer time period than just two years. Operator : We will now go to Dan Oppenheim with Zelman & Associates. Dan Oppenheim : Thanks very much. I was just wondering if you could talk, in terms of San Francisco you talked about the expectation that as we go through the spring season, you're hoping that there will be better trends in terms of the new lease growth there. Wondering, in terms of the guidance for the full year, how much of that is based on that expectation of improvement versus being based on the embedded rent growth that you have at this point based on the strength of last year. David Neithercut : Well. So, call it a high single-digit with five and change built-in. We know renewals will deliver in the high single-digits which is roughly 50% of our revenue growth. So really as far as contribution of new rental rate to the overall full year revenue growth, it's about 25%. Operator : We will now go to Greg Van Winkle with Morgan Stanley. Greg Van Winkle : Are you starting to see a bigger difference in pricing power between A and B quality properties in your core markets? David Neithercut : I'm not sure we've seen any change. I think that there's been very strong demand for the good-quality product and that demand will push other buyers maybe to lesser quality products. So I don't think there's been any real change over the last year, six months, 90 days between the two. Our teams came back from the NMHC meetings in Orlando last month. We are quite confident that there will continue to be really strong demand across all qualities in these core markets and have really seen no let up whatsoever. Greg Van Winkle : Okay. And we're continuing to see a lot more supply growth in the urban cores and in the suburbs. My question I guess is, do you think the apartment industry is building the right amount of products in the right places today? And I know you guys talked about, you have a view that the urban core is the place to be in the long run and we are seeing more demand growth there than in the suburbs right now. But do you think in the near term there might be some overbuilding there relative to the suburbs in some markets? David Neithercut : Well, I guess I can only answer the question or judge that by the success we have had leasing up the properties that we have developed in the urban core. And the strength has been just incredible. You know Washington DC over the last several years has delivered 30,000 units and occupancy hardly budged. Now we didn\u2019t have a lot of pricing power for several years but as David indicated, we hope to see that change in 2016. I think there is more product being built downtown because more people want to live downtown. I guess I have questions about how many people want to leave downtown to move to the suburbs that live in a structured box. So we just think long-term that this move to urbanization is not a short-term but a long-term phenomena and that we are very much positioned where we want to be now. Particularly having sold what we have sold and what we intend to sell for the balance of the year. The statistics will be quite clear as the perspective of the percentage of our income from the urban core, the walk scores of our properties etcetera, etcetera, will be without peer in our space. Greg Van Winkle : All right, great. And then last one, just quickly here. On your occupancy guidance you're expecting it to remain about flat in 2016 at 96%, I think. Do you think there's any room you have to drive occupancies higher? Or would you rather not see it climb much more if it means you're not pushing hard enough on rents? David Santee : Yes. I think that was our thesis back in late 2014-2015, was that demand increased organically, we did not do anything to grow our occupancy. And we are pretty much in net effective shop and we will let the rent and demand be the god. Certainly San Francisco is a great example of where demand far outstrips supply and we saw 100 basis point pickup in the previous 18 months while still increasing rents 14%, 15%. That's kind of the job of LRO and our pricing team is to optimize that balance with occupancy and rate each and every day. Operator : We will now go to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : I had a question on right-sizing your common dividends. I realize it's prudent to maximize retained earnings and keep your CAD ratio low. But some investors unfamiliar with your company may view a cut as a negative event. And I'm wondering if that was factored at all into your decision making, particularly given the new real estate GICS classification. Mark Parrell : Yes. It's Mark Parrell. Honestly in a year where we are planning to pay our shareholders an $11 special dividend, it didn't occur to us that the annual recurring dividend would be the topmost concern and that going down it needs to make sense relative to our cash flow in good and bad times. It needs to be resilient. So when operations do decline, we're not in a position with the dividends to let some or immediately uncovered. So I guess we have a policy, we think that transparency has a lot of value. So people who are in that, predictability has a lot of value. So we didn't think about freezing the annual dividend in order to just preserve those optics. We think people in the long run will see through that. John Kim : Okay. And then are you doing anything different this year as far as marketing to non-REIT investors or maybe something you may change in your reporting? There are some beneficial items such as asset sale gains that are not reflected in earnings and may not be as apparent to equity investors. David Neithercut : Sure. I mean this is a very important year for REITs. I think it's a terrific opportunity for us to market to a wider set of people whose eyes are open to the benefits of owning real estate in a public format. And so we do intend to be pretty aggressive this year in reaching out to generalists, to people who don\u2019t own. And we are trying to think about things in a more general way instead of giving it to specific statistical information that some of our more longer term investors are more focused on. I think some of these generalists are more focused on more broader demographic trends , broader population usage. You know people being more interested in urban core and maybe not owning cars. Those are facts that are more of interest to some of the generalist investors than per square foot rent numbers or per square foot build numbers. So, yes, we do have a big focus this year on that and we do intend to discuss both earnings in the way they think about it and IRRs in the way we think about. Getting the most you can get out of a portfolio. A lot of our activity this year, as you pointed out, was about maximizing the IRR on some of these assets and returning capital which we think is good for all shareholders generally and are dedicated. John Kim : So are you contemplating an alternate to FFO or core FFO? David Neithercut : No. Operator : And we will take Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities. Tom Lesnick : I think earlier in the call you mentioned some softness in some of the larger units, particularly in New York City. I was just wondering, is there any evidence of that being a more widespread trend? And is there any evidence of a stronger home buying environment being attributable to that? David Santee : No. I mean there is -- this is David Santee. There is really no change in home buying in our core markets. I think the focus on the two and three bedrooms is limited to the Upper West Side and perhaps our new developments. But when you are 96% plus occupied across most markets, you generally have a good mix of product. Typically in New York, the majority of our units are studios and one bedroom. So the fact that we have so few and the fact that those so few are more vacant really causes us to focus on that from a revenue perspective. So I don't see any other issues in any other markets relative to demand for larger apartments. Tom Lesnick : Got it. And then my second topic was Airbnb. I was just wondering, first, if you could quantify what financial impact at all that has had on your business. And then, secondly, have you met with them and is there any progress there on resolving some of the issues? David Neithercut : Well, let me answer your first question. The economic on our business we have no way to determine that. There was no deal signed, there was no agreement in place at the moment. Should we entertain an agreement, I would say that economic benefits would be at the bottom of our priority list and it's really more about gaining transparency and control of what's going on all around us today. So regardless of what happens, I don\u2019t see any direct material economic benefit to our company. Perhaps more so with residents and those who choose to participate in the sharing economy. But I think we have ways to go before anything meaningful comes with that. Operator : We will now go to Michael Lewis with SunTrust. Michael Lewis : Thank you. You've given a lot of good detail on San Francisco. I wanted to ask, more specifically, it looks like the Mission Bay development is leasing up a few quarters ahead of schedule, and I was wondering if that's due to maybe getting a little bit more aggressive ahead of some competing new supply, including some other projects you guys are working on. Or if it's more of an organic thing that demand has just been that strong, and actually a similar situation for your Odin development in Seattle. David Neithercut : It's really the latter. I mean you answered your own question. Really, Michael, honestly, just demand is that strong in that marketplace. Now Mission Bay has been impacted a little bit as of late because of some competing supply in Mission Bay but that's absorbing very quickly. And Oden and in Ballard in Seattle is essentially the same thing. There's just that much demand of this kind of housing in these locations. And so our absorption has been in those assets much faster than what we had thought at rates that met or exceeded expectations. We are obviously very pleased with both of them. Michael Lewis : Thanks. And then on New York. Similarly, you've given some good detail on the sub-markets in New York. Last week SL Green made some comments on their call about slowing job growth and retail sales that panicked office investors and maybe apartment investors as well. I'm just wondering, if you're concerned about the job growth picture there. And as you think about your markets where there's risk, so not necessarily the weakest performers like maybe DC, but where there's risk where things could fall off the table. Is New York that market, or is San Francisco that market that might concern you a little? David Santee : This is David Santee. You know I think perhaps there could be some short-term dislocation in the quality of product that is being delivered in New York. The only way you could build an apartment building in New York is through a 421a subsidy. And the rents command the top end of the market. But there are plenty of people that make considerable amounts of money that can afford those types of buildings. So I think what you see is what we see. And in every other market when we have a concentration of deliveries, there is near-term impact. And I don\u2019t see New York falling off the cliff. I mean it's kind of the number one place that people want to be in the world. And I think should there be any short term dislocation, it would come back even stronger than it had been before as it has every other time that it's taken a dip. San Francisco, I just think that, look, even though you are delivering the apartments in the urban core, the area is still under-served as far as affordable housing. And when you look at the job projections across San Jose, San Francisco and Oakland, you are looking at 122,000 jobs in 2016 and delivering only 6000 apartments. So I don\u2019t see anything materially changing in San Francisco. Operator : We will now go to Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Rich Anderson : Mark Parrell, you mentioned the $2,200 of CapEx. How much of that would you put in the revenue versus non-revenue buckets? Mark Parrell : We have about $725 per unit which equates to about that $40 million we have number. It's hard for me to put a precise percentage. Certainly there is a percentage of that that's more or less deferred maintenance but a great deal of it is optional. We talk about it at investment committee and in fact we would probably also add that there is some sustainability stuff in those numbers that has a pretty good ROI on it. So, I guess, I can't give you a precise number. I think it's probably more revenue enhancing than it is just necessary capital in that rehab category, but I don't have some specific number for you. Rich Anderson : Okay. Thanks. David Neithercut, can you quantify, not quantify, qualify the nature of your buying public here? I know with the $700 million you are expected to sell, that was supposed to be individually or small portfolios. Is that changing at all? And is the audience of potential buyers with FIRPTA and changes in the non-traded REIT world changing along with it? David Neithercut : Well, certainly nothing has changed with respect to those assets that are in Connecticut, Massachusetts, that we talk about as sort of the [growth] [ph] assets. Which were the additional dispositions that we announced that we would sell when we announced the original Starwood transaction. Those are small assets. Local and regional players, we have got some of those under contract today. In our last investment committee discussion the team running that told us that they were seeing those bids come in just pretty much as they had expected with the same sort of cast of characters that they had expected. So really no change there. With respect to any other change as a result of the FIRPTA, I think that many of those investors are still trying to figure that out. They have been operating under one set of guidelines for a long time and now they are trying to figure out with the new set, exactly how they might want to move forward. So I wouldn\u2019t say that we have seen any change at the present time. Rich Anderson : With the $600 million that you have contemplated in addition to the $700 million, would that be more like a large portfolio all at once or also kind of in piecemeal? David Neithercut : No, there is some larger assets involvement. It's fewer assets than what you might think. So just a small handful. Rich Anderson : Okay. And then the last question is, you had a humongous deal, number one was buying Archstone and now this humongous deal number two is selling to Starwood and other asset sales. What's the crossover there? I guess what percentage of the Starwood sale came from the Archstone buy? David Neithercut : I am not sure if any of it did. I guess maybe one or two assets. One or two assets at most. Operator : We will now go to Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Alex Goldfarb : Just some quick questions. On San Francisco and then comparing it to Seattle and the Peninsula, it sounds like the rent softness in the fourth quarter was purely supply as opposed to a slowdown in jobs. But if you could just provide some perspective with what you're seeing across those three tech oriented markets on the job front over the past three to six months. David Santee : For San Francisco versus Seattle? Alex Goldfarb : Yes. And the Peninsula as well. David Santee : Okay. Well, Seattle continues to be in high demand. Amazon continues -- we look at the online job openings, they are still in the 4600 to 4800 range. A lot of the supply continues to move around. I think you will see that supply skewed towards Belleview in 2016. But as far as job growth in Seattle, we see that very strong in 2016. What do we have here, 2.3%, almost 44,000 jobs expected in Seattle. In San Francisco, I would say we didn\u2019t see any softness in the fourth quarter. I think that\u2019s what you ask me. I think that the softness more appeared right around the holidays and as we came into the New Year. I mean when you look back over the past two years in San Francisco, rents in January were up 15% over the previous year and in January of '14 rents were up 13% over the previous year. So you are just starting at a different point and when you look at the makeup of pricing, both in San Francisco and the Peninsula, the urban core is being affected by what's being delivered down there today. But the job growth outlook down the Peninsula, I think are very favorable. I mean every day we are reading about, whether it's Oracle, whether it's Apple, whether it's Airbnb and the Citi. All these large companies continue to lockup office space or land or have already started building other office headquarters. So I don\u2019t see any slowdown in the jobs in San Francisco and I think the softness on the rate that we see today is very concentrated as a result of new supply. David Neithercut : Yes. And I will just add, we are doing a lease up in San Jose today in which we actually saw acceleration in activity in December from what the averages have been from the prior months starting in September. So I know Seattle is, Dave had mentioned about our property in Odin leasing up extraordinarily well, our [indiscernible] 99 leasing up extraordinarily well. And then as we talked about in Mission Bay, we are leasing up against some competition that\u2019s slowed down a little bit but that\u2019s not going to be an issue. Those units will absorb quickly. Alex Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second question is for Mark. Mark, a two parter. One, have you now repaid all the associated Archstone secured debt? And then, two, I think in your comments you said that you guys are contemplating a secured issuance at year end. So if that's the case, just a little more color, maybe the joint venture asset or there's some particulars with that why you're going secured versus your normal unsecured route. Mark Parrell : So, thanks, Alex. So the first question on the Archstone secured debt, except for the tax exempt debt that we inherited, we inherited several $100 million of floating rate, very inexpensive Archstone tax exempt debt. We have repaid all the secured debt that we inherited from that transaction after repayment of the pool that we mentioned in the press release. On the second question, again, it's just an assumption. We haven't done a large secured debt pool in a while. It's also a fairly small borrowing. The unsecured market really has a strong preference now for a larger borrowings and larger borrowers like us. So I wouldn\u2019t go to market on a non-index eligible, $200 million unsecured deal. I would go with something larger like $500 million. So given our relatively modest needs, my sense is we do a secured deal. We haven't done one in a couple of years, a large pool. So it'd probably be good to feel that market out and sort of see what all the terms exactly are as well. But that\u2019s really more a function just besides being relatively small. Operator : We will now go to Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay : A quick question on your pro forma exposure. Do you have that by market, assuming the Starwood transaction and the contemplated $2 billion of dispositions? Mark Parrell : Yes. And we have actually added that Wes. Those properties that we have under construction sort of on a stabilized basis. And it roughly breaks down where on the east coast Boston is about 10%, New York is 19% or 20% or so, and BC about 18%. So just little bit under half on the east coast. And then around 9% or so percent in Seattle, about 20% in San Francisco and 25% throughout the three markets in Southern California. So LA, Orange County and San Diego. So a little bit more than half on the west coast. And again that\u2019s after that Starwood, after everything else we are contemplating selling and putting on line and stabilizing all that is currently under development. Wes Golladay : Okay. And then for the first quarter do you guys have the NOI expectations for the quarter excluding the NOI earned from dispositions. So sort of a core NOI expectation for the quarter? Mark Parrell : That\u2019s a pretty heavy level of detail. We will give it a word. I mean I think we would suggest that same store NOI for the first quarter of 2016 would be approximately $400 million and that goes into the $1.6 billion I quoted earlier. And that number goes up throughout the year so it's a little below $400 million in the first quarter and ends up being above it, obviously. And then you have got lease up income which in the first quarter might be $10 million to $15 million and by the end of the year is more like $20 million. But again, I think we are getting into a great deal of precision at this point and it will certainly be variability. Wes Golladay : Okay. Thanks for taking a stab at that. Last one, when you look at DC, how do you see that market playing out throughout the year? Do you plan to get more aggressive during peak leasing season this year versus last year of for the renewals? David Neithercut : Well, I guess I would say that you have seen all renewals gradually increase over the last two or three years. I think two years ago we did a three, last year we did a four, this year we are tracking at a five. But really what will be the catalyst for DC is, we are moving the pricing pressure on new leases. I think once people get to a place that they are comfortable with, that\u2019s close proximity to where they work and the amenities that they enjoy outside, they tend to stay. So it's just a matter of getting the new people I the door at a higher rate. And when you look at the distribution of new deliveries, you are going to deliver far more units outside of what we call close in Arlington and the district itself. So I think the stars were lined to start seeing better performance come from our DC portfolio. Operator : We will now go to Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Tayo Okusanya : Just a quick two parter around guidance. On the lower end of guidance and the assumptions behind it, is it safe to say that that scenario is strictly based on the outlook of there's a recession in the U.S.? Or is that kind of more behind that lower end of guidance? And then on the other side of the equation, is there any scenario you can think about where you could actually end up doing better than guidance, similar to what happened in 2015? David Neithercut : So when we put guidance together and it isn't a vast difference this year, what we do here Tayo is we think about the NOI range would give us on either side. And then we think about our acquisitions and dispositions which are usually, we know them within a certain, fairly close tolerance. The lower end of that range is only accessible if dispositions were accelerated. We do not get there from our NOI numbers and as David Santee has indicated, we have no reason to believe we will be anywhere below our NOI guidance range. So I would tell you we only get to $3 if we announce next quarter that we have sold a lot of what is in process now, very quickly. So that really is the way you get to the bottom of that range. It isn't because we contemplated recession in our numbers. And I will just take this opportunity to go a little bit further and talk about the trend of FFO by quarter because we have given you a guidance midpoint of $0.75 for the first quarter. And that will go up we think modestly every quarter and will be slightly over 80 by the time you get to the fourth quarter. So as you look forward, it isn't the same sharp increase you are used to seeing from us because there is some dilution. But I think at the end you will still see a number, $0.80 or so, by the fourth quarter and probably a little bit higher. Tayo Okusanya : Okay. And then on the other end of the spectrum, when you kind of think about opportunities to outperform guidance? David Neithercut : Well, that would come from dispositions being delayed and NOI either from lease-ups or from same store doing considerably better than our current expectations. Operator : We will now go to Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Michael Bilerman : It's Michael Bilerman. Mark, that's exactly what I wanted to ask you in terms of the run rate. So, effectively you're going to end the year, let's call it, 320, 325 on an annualized basis. When you take out the special dividend your multiple would have contracted relative to when you announced the Starwood deal. So, there clearly is some uncertainty in the marketplace when people see a headline relative to what the underlying valuation really is. And while your dividend is going down, you're actually increasing your yield on a post-dividend basis as well, by 20-25 basis points. So, hopefully when people shift through it and start thinking about where your multiple is on a post-dividend basis it would clear itself up, right? Mark Parrell : Agreed in every respect. Michael Bilerman : And then the second question I was going to ask was just related to New York and the Upper West Side, and the Trump buildings. Clearly there's a lot of Trump news over the last number of months. I'm just curious whether that has had any effect, both positive and negative, potentially, as he supports New York values, on your buildings and any leasing activity there. David Neithercut : Who? Michael, here is what it is, and it will be what it is for a while, would be my guess. It's interesting to sort of watch and I will tell you that I don\u2019t think anybody who is visiting our properties particularly cares and just it is what it is. Operator : There are no other questions at this time. David Neithercut : Great. Well, thank you all for your time today. We look forward to visiting with you all as the year progresses. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Today's conference is being recorded and at this time, I'd like to turn it over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead. Marty McKenna : Thank you, Kayla. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's first quarter 2016 results and our outlook for the year. Our featured speakers today are David Neithercut, our President and CEO; David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Parrell, our Chief Financial Officer. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. And now I'll turn the call over to David Neithercut. David Neithercut : Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We're very pleased to have had another very solid quarter of operations, growing same store revenue of 4.6% in the quarter, holding property level operating expenses flat, and delivering another very good quarter of 6.6% growth in net operating income. As is well known, the West Coast markets continue to lead the pack, while our East Coast markets deal with new supply. That, while being reasonably well absorbed, does continue to negatively impact our pricing power. As David Santee will discuss in more detail in just a moment, unlike 2015, this year we've experienced a more normal seasonal occupancy and pricing pattern that caused us to modestly reduce the midpoint of our expected same store revenue range for the year. Nevertheless, our current expectations are for another very strong year of revenue growth, growing again above long-term historical trends which continues to demonstrate the strong demand for rental housing in high-density urban and close and walkable suburban locations in our gateway coastal cities driven by a very strong and now positive demographic picture. So with that said, I'll let David go to more detail about what we're seeing across our markets today our current outlook as we enter our primary leasing season. David Santee : Thank you, David. Good morning everyone. Today, I'll provide color on our Q1 operating results, focusing on the four key drivers of revenue growth and the impact of those results on our full-year guidance, followed by what we experienced in each of our markets during Q1 and the direction we expect each to take for the balance of the year. I'll close with a brief update on expenses for the quarter and full year. Our 2016 revenue guidance assumptions were based on the expectation of maintaining the 96% occupancy we had in 2015, achieving the same level of rate growth that was achieved in 2015 comprised of the renewals averaging 6% and new lease rates averaging 3%, the turnover being flat. 2016 is shaping up to be another one of the best years we have had with our expectation of continuing above trend revenue growth and very manageable expense growth, leading to very good NOI growth in our same store portfolio. For the quarter, occupancy was exceptionally strong at 95.9%, but appeared to show a return to the normal seasonal pattern. One of the reasons that 2015 was an exceptional year of performance was that we did not see the typical seasonal occupancy dip at the end of 2014 and beginning of 2015. We have seen that seasonal pattern return but at 95.9% occupied, we are still a solid 50 to 70 bps higher than years past. The result of more seasonable occupancy in the quarter we've seen concessions into some markets and more significantly, in our New York City market, specifically Manhattan, there is new supply pressure on the West side. On the flip side, we saw improving occupancy in Southern California and Washington, DC. Based on what we saw in Q1, we are expecting to see some seasonal softening in Q4 and are lowering our full year occupancy projection from 96% to 95.9%, which again is still some of the strongest occupancy in our history. Renewals continued to be very good and actually exceeded our expectations, averaging 6.2% for the quarter and 6.2% for April. May and June currently stand at 5.6% but we would expect to close out these months at or above 6%. As a result of the seasonality and the introduction of concessions, the impact to new lease rate growth has left us in a position of trailing our full year rental rate growth projections up 3%. While January met our expectations, net effective new lease rents quickly deteriorated to below 2% for a period of time and currently sit at 2.5% versus same week last year. Additionally, we saw a disproportionate number of premium rent apartments vacate during the quarter, which further impacted growth. With that said, we are lowering our expectations for full year new lease rate growth by 30 to 40 basis points and will still deliver 24 consecutive quarters of revenue growth exceeding 4% by year's end. Lastly, turnover declined for the quarter from 10.9% to 10.8% and was in line with our expectations. All in all, or all in, while we believe we will have a very robust leasing season and a strong fourth quarter finish in occupancy, we think it's unlikely we will have the momentum to reach the 4.9% midpoint of our original revenue guide. Let's not forget, instead of having a spectacular year like 2015, we will have a great year that is still well above historical long term trends. Today, we are 96.2% occupied and again, renewal rates achieved in March and April were 6.1% and 6.2%, respectively, with May and June shaping up to be in the same range. Net effective new lease rent growth remains in the mid-2%s and exposure with the tick below same week last year. As we enter peak leasing season, we are, once again, well positioned to optimize the four key drivers of revenue, of, revenue occupancy, renewal rate, new lease rates, and turnover. Now moving on to the markets, I'd like to lead off with New York and then San Francisco, as these two markets are grabbing the most attention. In New York, the year started off with, what I'll call the negativity bubble, with some unease about the New York economy that sees the impact of psyche of both renters and landlords. A number of new lease ups were delivered into the market, typically the Upper West side and the result was escalated concessions. We made every attempt to stick with our net effective rent strategy to no avail. It became clear we have joined the concession party to close deals. Today our New York portfolio is 96.8% occupied and renewal rates achieved for the quarter averaged 4.5%, and are already in the mid-4%s for April through June, which implies they will go higher. As quick as New York showed signs of softening, it has now turned more positive, with a sharp falloff in concessions but with new lease rates only slightly positive versus the flat to down we experienced in Q1. Manhattan, Brooklyn, Midtown, and the Jersey Waterfront are all producing year-to-date revenue growth of 3% to 5%, however, the Upper West side, which accounts for 30% of our New York market rental revenue, remains under pressure as a result of new supply, diluting the overall positive picture of New York. In March, we said that we were moving our expectations for New York from a high 3% to a low 3% for total revenue growth and our position is unchanged. In San Francisco, year-to-date rental revenue ranges from a low of 9.5% to a high of 13.3% across all of our submarkets, with the exception of SoMa. As a result of new supply in the city and Mission Bay, SoMa has felt the impact of a concessionary environment. Making up over 10% of our San Francisco rental revenue, the submarket is producing still very strong 6.2% revenue growth through April and is the largest contributor to our 30 basis point decline in occupancy for the quarter. Occupancy for Q1 was 96.4% but started to soften in March and is now 96% today, wearing last year's pattern with a 65 basis point drop from March to April. We expect to spring back to 96.5% or better in May as peak leasing season is only weeks away.  Renewal net rates achieved for the quarter for San Francisco averaged 8.9% and we would expect renewals through June to average in the high to mid-8%. Net effective new lease rents have averaged 4% year to date and it appears that perhaps we have reached a point of moderation, although we are still a month out from our peak leasing season, when rents historically begin to move up. In summary, San Francisco is still solid and it will be our top performing market in 2016. We have no reports of any job loss due to declines in venture capital investment, traffic thus far is on par with last year, and we expect a normal pricing pressures where new supply directly competes with our asset. Now onto Southern California, our next emerging boomtown, both LA and San Diego are exceeding expectations thus far, with Orange County meeting expectations. With the concentration of new supply in downtown LA not directly impacting our portfolio, all of our key submarkets continue to exhibit signs of acceleration with West LA, our largest submarket, at 26% of the LA rental market revenue delivering 7.1% revenue growth through April. All other submarkets are delivering 6% plus with the downtown market at 4.1%. The rental rates achieved through June has averaged slightly below 7%, with net effective new lease rents averaging 6% plus year to date. With a slight decline in turnover for the quarter and 120 basis point pick up in occupancy quarter over quarter, LA appears to be well positioned to be one of our best performing markets in 2016. San Diego remains steady on all fronts as new supply is dispersed across the region versus Orange County, where new supply remains concentrated in the Irvine area. Orange County renewal rates achieved remain above 7% with net effective new lease rents accelerating the past several weeks to above 8%. We would expect all of SoCal to continue its acceleration through the rest of the year, with only mild pricing pressure in the downtown LA submarket. Seattle also saw the normal seasonality return with lower occupancy and higher exposure through much of the first quarter. But it's still meeting expectations with solid rental rate growth. Renewal rates achieved for Q1 averaged 8.2% and should average 8% in Q2. Net effective new lease rents averaged around 5% for the quarter but recently improved to 7.3% as the peak season is underway. Both Amazon and Microsoft open positions have significant increased since the previous quarter with Amazon jumping from the normal 4,800 open positions to 7,200 positions as their Cloud Services division continues to grow leaps and bounds. Most of our submarkets are delivering in excess of 7.2% revenue growth through April. The CBD, which makes, which has two assets, is at 3.3% revenue growth and then Bellevue, consisting of two assets, is our bottom performing submarket. With limited new supply on the horizon and the limited capacity of construction personnel, we would expect Seattle to perform well through 2016. Our cautious outlook on Boston remains unchanged and still expects to hover around 3% revenue growth for the full year. With the outer suburban submarkets doing just fine, the urban core, which includes Cambridge, remains under pressure from new deliveries. Renewal rates achieved in Q1 averaged 5.9% and will be above 5% through June. However, net effective new lease pricing continues to float in the 1% to 2% range. Absorption has been very favorable and most lease-ups are just about complete, creating a window of stability through the end of the year. And last but not least, Washington DC continues to climb out of the trenches and is currently tracking ahead of our expectations. Much of the new supply in the last two years has competed head-to-head with much of our portfolio. Renewal rates achieved during Q1 averaged 4.1% versus 2.7% in Q1 of 2015. For 2016, Arlington, Pentagon City, Alexandria will feel the blunt of new deliveries and is our bottom performing submarket at negative 80 basis points of revenue growth. Silver Springs, Bethesda and the District are both jockeying for best revenue growth year-to-date with 1.6% and 1.4%, respectively. Revenue from these two submarkets make up almost 50% of total revenue for our DC market. The outer burbs continue to have solid revenue growth of 2.1% in Northern Virginia and 3.4% in Prince George's County. Across the market, renewal rates achieved continue to accelerate from the 3.9% in March to an already achieved rate of 4.9% in June. Net effective new lease rent rates, thus far, are developing a solid floor of 2% and occupancy was 30 basis points favorable for the quarter. With less impact from new deliveries, significant job growth in the professional services sectors, Washington is showing strong, sustainable signs of improving revenue growth. With expenses for the quarter, they were better than expected as the malaise in energy prices drove most of the outperformance. Electric, natural gas and heating oil were all down 6%, 13%, and 39% respectively. Additionally, the mild winter and no major storms allowed us to realize a 50% reduction in snow removal costs. Real estate taxes, which now make up 40% of total expense, and are now forecast to grow approximately 5.5%, with 1.9 percentage points of this growth attributable to 421a tax abatement burn-off in New York, with the magnitude of savings that we realized in Q1 and the expectation of continued favorable variances in energy, we are comfortable with taking the upper half of expense guidance off the table, moving from 2.5% to 3.5%, down to 2.5% to 3%. So while we didn't power through the quarter as we did in 2015, we still see solid fundamentals across all of our markets. New lease pricing will continue to feel the impact of new deliveries that go head-to-head with our assets in the near-term but solid renewal rates, above-average occupancy, and continued lower turnover with produce exceptional results for EQR in 2016. David Neithercut : All right. Thanks David. Noted in last night's earnings release, we acquired three properties in the first quarter, one each in Brooklyn, Los Angeles and Seattle, for $204 million in weighted average cap rate of 4.9%. Now you may recall, we said that we had some cash protection obligations with some unaffiliated third parties arising from the Starwood sale that would be covered with approximately $300 million of acquisitions. So this activity, along with acquisitions in the fourth quarter of last year, have satisfied that responsibility. In addition to the first quarter disposition activity we discussed on our last call, which included the Starwood transaction in the sale of River Tower Manhattan. During the quarter, we also closed on the sales of seven other non-core assets, totaling 2,577 apartment units. The largest of those deals was our 1,811-unit Woodland Park property in East Palo Alto, California, which we acquired out of foreclosure in late 2011 for $130 million. I was very pleased to sell this asset for 412.5 million and realized an unlevered IRR of 37.2%. We also sold four properties totaling 274 units in Massachusetts, one property in South Florida, and one property in Denver. Our transaction guidance has not changed for the year and as a reminder, calls for $7.4 billion of dispositions. This is comprised of about 6.2 billion from Starwood, River Tower, and Woodland Park, an additional $900 million of non-core sales, the gains from which would be included in the special dividends paid this year, which Mark will discuss more fully in just a moment. At $300 million of activity to occur, if and only if, we can find suitable acquisition opportunities for which we are willing to trade out of current assets. But I'll tell you, we're not working on much of the present time and by way of new acquisitions, so this activity, if there is any, will occur towards the back end of the year. Of the 900 million of non-core dispositions to have occurred this year, which will not be reinvested in new acquisitions or developments, about 150 million was closed in the first quarter, leaving 750 million yet to be closed this year. Because of the average size of these deals, this represents a significant number of transactions and the team is hard at work to get all this done by year end but it is possible that some of this activity will slip into 2017. With regard to the development business, while we did not start any new projects in the quarter, we're currently working on $380 million of deals that could start construction yet this year, with a weighted average yield on cost at today's rents in the mid [5%s] while it's possible we can get all of this underway this year, it's also possible that some of this activity will slip into early 2017 as well. So now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Thank you, David. I want to take a few minutes this morning to talk about our guidance revisions for 2016. I will also discuss where we stand in terms of the remaining special dividend payment and review some of the changes we made to our press release and to our supplement. As David Neithercut discussed, portfolio wise, 2016 will be another very good year for Equity Residential. And as David Santee mentioned in his remarks, our New York performance is slightly below our expectations for the year, making the very high end of our original guidance range unattainable in 2016. As a result, we have revised our guidance range for same store revenues to 4.5% to 5%, from 4.5% to 5.25%. On the same store operating expense side, we have revised our guidance range to 2.5% to 3%, to about from 2.5% to 3.5% growth for the full year. The mathematical results of all these changes, the same store revenue and expense guidance, is to reduce our NOI range to 5% to 6% from our previous guidance range, which was 5% to 6.5%. The impact of this on normalized FFO was relatively minor, about $0.01 per share negative. Switching to our normalized FFO we have narrowed the range of our normalized FFO for the year to $3.05 to $3.15 per share, which maintains our $3.10 per share midpoint. This is being driven by our expectation for slightly lower same-store net operating income and for higher G&A costs than we expected. These negative variances are being offset by the additional NOI from owning our disposition assets longer than we had expected. While we have maintained the dollar amounts of our transaction guidance, we have moved back the timing for our remaining dispositions and acquisitions from occurring relatively evenly over quarters 2, 3, and 4 to being concentrated later in the year. While the disposition market remains strong, many of the assets we are selling are in relatively small niche markets in rural New England, which requires us to carefully meter our disposition pace in order not to overload the market. We have adjusted the midpoint of our guidance for G&A up by $4 million. This is due to severance cost to right size our platform to our lower unit count following all of this recent disposition activity. We expect quarterly normalized FFO to slowly trend up during the second half of 2016, driven by solid same store and lease up results. The rate of growth, however, will be moderated by the loss of NOI from our disposition activity. Now I'm going to move over to our new disclosures. We've made a number of changes for our disclosure this quarter. We hope that these changes will be helpful to you in understanding the business and for comparability purposes. We also believe that these changes will help us market more effectively to investors that are new to the real estate space. Now I'm going to hit a few highlights., we added a glossary of key terms and definitions on Pages 25 through 28 of the release. We are also no longer including an allocation of property management expense in our calculation of our same store operating expenses and in our NOI, or in our calculation of unlevered IRRs from our disposition. The process of allocating property management costs among our various property types, like same store, lease ups, other non-same store fee managed was fairly complex and seems to us to be unnecessary, especially in the fact that our competitors generally do not include property management expenses in NOI. We have added guidance for our 2016 normalized property management expenses, with all our other guidance items on Page 24 of the release. We think that evaluating aggregate over a cost, consisting of property management, whether included in same store or not, and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue, is the best gauge of corporate efficiency. We have also changed our portfolio summary and same store pages by pulling out our retail and garage operations from the calculations of average rental rates. We have added turnover by markets to our same store operating metrics pages to provide more transparency at the market level. We have provided distinct definitions for what we would call Acquisition Cap Rate and Disposition Yield on our transaction activity. Finally, we have made many other presentation changes, including adding a Highlights section, adding a comparison of our portfolio before and after our significant 2016 dispositions, and disclosing the dollar amount of economic gain from our larger dispositions as well as our unlevered IRRs. Moving on to the special dividends, as you know, in March, we paid a special dividend of $8 per share, or approximately $3 billion from the proceeds of our asset dispositions this year. David Neithercut gave you an update on our progress on selling the remaining non-core assets in our 2016 disposition plan. The range for the second special dividend payment is going to remain $2 to $4 per share. We would expect to declare and pay this planned second payment in the late third quarter or fourth quarter. In a related matter, and as we discussed with you last quarter, we used about $2 billion of the proceeds from our 2016 asset sales to retire debt that was primarily due to mature in 2016 and 2017. We expect our net debt to normalized EBITDA ratio at year end 2016 to be about 5.6 times. Currently, our net debt to normalized EBITDA disclosure on Page 16 reflects an even better ratio of about 4.6 times. This is caused by the fact that this ratio compares our reduced debt balance at March 31, 2016, for our trailing 12 month normalized EBITDA, which includes significant income from sold properties. This will trend up as the year progresses and we drop old quarters out of the calculation and use cash to pay the second special dividend. At year end, I expect we will have $50 million of cash on hand and have a balance outstanding on revolving line of credit of about $130 million, leaving us with about $2.3 billion of undrawn capacity on our line. I will now ask Kayla to begin the question-and-answer session. Kayla? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first from Ross Nussbaum, UBS Ross Nussbaum : Hey, it's Ross Nussbaum with Nick. Two distinct questions. I guess the first is, is there any way you can navigate the tax waters and shift gears to move towards a stock buyback versus the remaining special dividend you have planned given the decline in the stock has occurred here of late? David Neithercut : Not really with the PRIM sheets from dispositions that we have announced for us; these are assets, many of which we have owned an awfully long time and the gain is significant. We made that pretty clear when we first announced this deal. However, many months ago that the, in order to right size a balance sheet, we'd be thoughtful about doing something on an unlevered neutral basis and then just dealing with the gain, there would be very little proceeds left over for the stock buyback. Ross Nussbaum : Okay, and then operationally, I understood the comments about seasonal patterns coming in with the addition of the supply, but I guess my question is, how can you really tell the difference between the seasonal occupancy impact and the supply impact? Or maybe said differently how do you know that the erosion of rent growth that you saw wasn't purely by DRIP. David Santee : Ross, this is David Santee. I guess I would say for the past several years, we had several, I mean, all of the markets have had significant levels of new deliveries and we've seen that when properties go head to head, but when you see softness in occupancy across the entire market, that impact like a San Francisco, what have you, where occupancy is softer and your exposure builds up across the entire market, then that's more of a sign that seasonality is back versus like a SoMa, where occupancy fell to probably 93% or 92%, which was a direct result of new product in downtown and in Mission LA. So it really just comes from understanding the flow of the numbers and doing this for 30 years. Ross Nussbaum : Got it. I think Nick's got a question. Nick Yulico : Yes, hi. Just one sort of bigger picture question was, it seems like the market is having more concerns about new supply impacting more urban areas. How do you think about your own portfolio and I know you haven't really done this historically but thinking about perhaps doing some joint ventures of either existing assets or future development pipeline just to show sort of the market that there's still a lot of value in the portfolio and if not, really reflected in the stock price today? David Neithercut : Well, I think that there are and while there maybe have been fewer transactions maybe in the first quarter of this year, Nick, I think that there are often very meaningful transactions in our space and across our markets and that clearly demonstrate what NAV is of our portfolio. We sold a property in Manhattan at a low 3% yield, more than $1 million a door, so I think we did do a transaction ourselves which kind of clearly demonstrates what the value is of these assets. I'm not sure we need to do anything specifically. I think that there's enough activity going on around the marketplace, I think that clearly demonstrates where NAVs are, the demand for assets in these markets, the yields at which they trade, which suggests that we've got a significant amount of value in our portfolio above where we may be trading today. Operator : We'll take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi. Nick Joseph : Thanks. Looking at same-store revenue growth guidance for the last seven years, you have either met or exceeded the midpoint of your initial guidance each year and then you just talked about that the likely shortfall this year is caused by a return to more normal seasonality. So what was assumed in this year's guidance in terms of seasonality versus past years when you initially issued guidance? And now that we're six months past when you initially gave that guidance, what's the biggest surprise that you didn't initially expect? David Santee : Well, I don't know if it was a surprise. I think in my comments, I said we really just expected 2016 to mirror 2015. And I would say that in hindsight, 2015 was an anomaly year in the 30 years that I personally have been doing this. You know, occupancies did not decline in Q4. They did not decline in Q1. I mean places like San Francisco saw a 100 bps pick-up in occupancy, with rates continuing to grow versus the typical seasonal softening of 3% to 5%. So really, I don't know that I'm surprised. I'm disappointed that the market doesn't, isn't as fantastic as it was in 2015, but nevertheless delivering the 4%-plus revenue growth is still a very strong number. Nick Joseph : Thanks. And then just competing with new supply is 2016 the peak year for your submarkets and can you talk about expectations for 2017? David Neithercut : Well, again, it's different by market. Certainly, Washington DC will be much more palatable this year, coming off delivering two years of 30,000 units. Everywhere else, Boston is down. This year, New York is relative to what looks to be coming in the future is manageable. Let's see, San Francisco, you know, San Francisco is, I think, is more of a matter of concentration of assets. I don't know that you can oversupply apartments in San Francisco. Seattle is certainly very manageable. This is a peak year for Seattle about 7,000-plus units but it will fall off in the next couple of years. LA, you know you'll see continued 10,000-plus units probably for the next couple years but that, again, is a very large geographic market that you're talking about so it's more about concentration and submarkets of where these edicts get delivered, and then Orange County and San Diego really negligible. Nick Joseph : Thanks, and then finally, Mark, you mentioned the core FFO should trend up over 2016, and I think last quarter, you mentioned that 4Q, it should be around $0.80 a share, a little higher so given the updated guidance both same-store and transaction, what do you expect the run rate to be at the end of the year? Mark Parrell : Yes. It's about the same. There's no change, we didn't change the midpoint. So we feel the same way. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Hi. I was wondering if you could maybe share your expectations about what you think turnover and then renewals and new lease figures would look like for the second quarter and for the full year? Just in total. David Santee : Steve, so we really don't see any turnover. In fact, if you look at market by market, almost, a lot of the market showed 20 to 40 basis point declines. Boston had 180 basis point decline that -- I'm sorry, increased that overshadowed that. So, it's clear that once people get situated into their neighborhood and enjoy their lifestyle, they're not going to move unless it just becomes totally unaffordable. So we would expect turnover to continue to decline, as it has for probably the past four or five years. Renewal rates, we expect more of the same. I said in my prepared remarks that we would expect to average 6% for the full year. We've averaged 6.2% for the quarter. It looks like we'll get 6.2% for the second quarter, and as we get into peak leasing season when full on demand and I don't see any softening there. The problem is really rate and the level of new supply that competes head-to-head with our properties. Again, as an example, in downtown Boston, 60% of our revenue comes from the urban core, from probably four or five assets where rent new lease rate growth has been zero. So when you're getting 4%, 4.5% on a renewal and then someone moves out, you're giving back that 4.5%. So the real pressure will be new lease rate. Steve Sakwa : Okay and is that number 2.5% for the quarter and the 2.5% for the year? David Santee : That's what we're saying now, about 2.5%. David Neithercut : 2.5% to 2.75% [ph]. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And then I guess David, you sort of talked about some personnel changes or rightsizing. Maybe Mark made a comment as well about the severance. Can you maybe just talk about what areas that's in? Is that in market research? Is that in development? Is that in asset management, property management? What changes are you making at this point? David Neithercut : Well, I guess without going into a great deal of detail, Steve, clearly, we solved 20% or so of our units sold this year and we'll have to look at every function and make sure that we properly right size given what to do with unit count is going forward. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And I think on the development front, if I did my math right, about 60% of the under construction assets today are in San Francisco. And I don't think you provided necessarily a specific yield either on each one or certainly in aggregate, but just as you survey the development yields and the development projects today, how do you assess your ability to hit pro forma, given what's going on in San Francisco today? David Neithercut : Well, I mean really nothing's changed, we continue to be very well. We've delivered a couple of properties there one in San Jose and one in the Mission Bay and have done very well and looking at where those deals we trade at today; we've created considerable value. And the other transactions in San Francisco have been low 6s, mid 5s, may be to low 6s, and at the present time, we think we'll be just fine there. We really look at these as we start based upon where their yield based upon current rents, that's where the trend, continuing to trend rents, low double digits, high single digits, so as you look at lease up absorption of what we've done, absorption has been very strong and what we've achieved has been very much in our wheelhouse. So, and we continue to feel very good and again, I guess I just want to emphasize this. We think about building these products. I mean, really think about building long-term strings of income, not so much just what things will yield upon delivery but really try to think about investing capital over an extended time period. So well, half of the deals we'll get, we're quite confident that their locations and product that we're building will be happily owned for an extended time period. Steve Sakwa : Okay, and then I guess just last question for David Santee. Taking your expectations down a little bit but if you kind of just look at and assess the risk upside, downside from here, what markets or what things could maybe potentially surprise you to the upside and what things could maybe be downside risk to these revised numbers? David Santee : Well, I guess I would say if DC continues to gain traction, that could certainly be accretive to the upside LA, all of Southern California, is trending ahead of our expectations. You know, we also, just another data point, you know, back in December, it was clear that in many of our markets, that our employees were being challenged in finding places to live and so we implemented a larger employee discount. I mean, some of our employees in San Francisco were driving two hours, 2.5 hours to do an emergency service call. So we increased, on a market by market basis, we increased the employee discount. As an example, in San Francisco, that cost us 40 basis points of revenue growth in Q1. So we, without that increase and floor concession, we would have done a 9.9%. So you know, there's some little volatility in these employee concessions line and really, we have a lot of visibility into rate which we've already kind of adjusted for, we've already issued renewals through June, and really, once you issue renewals through August, you know you're pretty much baked for the full year so then it comes down to having a strong occupancy finish in Q4. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Conor Wagner, Green Street Advisors. Conor Wagner : On the 3Q call, David, you mentioned the process that began last spring when the stock was trading at a meaningful discount to NAV which ultimately led to the Starwood sale. How long did this NAV discount need to persist for you guys to start another process and what options would be on the table? David Neithercut : Well, I guess I'll just answer your last part of your question first. I think all options are on the table. I think that, I think we're in a little different camp than what many on the sales side think with respect to the magnitude of the discount and how long that needs to persist before one takes a lot of the actions that you all think one should and I guess I can only tell you that we have been a stock acquirer in the past. We will not be afraid to do so again and we will monitor the situation. I think that our actions with the special dividend suggests that we try and do what's right by our shareholders and if doing a stock buyback makes sense, then we can, are able to do so on a balance sheet on a neutral basis, we will certainly consider that going forward. Conor Wagner : Thank you. And for David Santee, were there lower lease expectations in 1Q this year versus last year? And can you give us your estimate for lease expirations in the coming quarters? David Santee : Yes. So we moved 8% of lease expirations in Q4 and 8% of lease expirations in Q1 into Q2 and Q3, I'm sorry, yes, Q2 and Q3. So the peak leasing season is really that much more important for us. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jana Galan : This is for David Santee. If you could comment on how rent, as a percent of income, is trending in your markets? And then with the revision of guidance, mostly on lower new lease rate expectations, is there any risk to renewals due to affordability concerns? David Santee : You know, I mean, every market will show, as rents escalate rapidly, just as San Francisco did two, three years ago, where 29% of our move outs were due to rent or just the increase being unmanageable, but yet, there were people waiting in line to backfill them and you're going to start to see that in Southern California, but as we said before, I mean, we use the same rent qualifier, 3 times the rent. So we only measure a person's income when they move then. So really that rent to income ratio never really changes. It's very, well, it's virtually impossible for us to track changes in people's earnings, as they live with us for three or four years. So no impact to the rent to income ratio and the move outs due to rent increase to expenses will fluctuate market by market depending upon the velocity of rate increases. Jana Galan : Thank you. And you've broken out the retail and the garage exposure versus rents. I was curious if there was a particular concentration in any market like New York and Boston or is that pretty much distributed around the six core markets? Mark Parrell : Hi, Jana. It's Mark Parrell. So on Page 8, the change overall for the Company on average rental rate was about 4%, so this is 4% lower than what we would have reported under our old methodology, there's really two or three markets where that's concentrated. New York, we would have reported a number instead of 3,740, more like 4,000 and that's just because we have a lot of retail in that market, a lot of garage operations. In Boston, similarly that would have been about 2,900, so about 10% difference because again, that market has significant garage operations and some retail. And Seattle is the other one that was not as significant where it's maybe $100 higher in that market as well and everything else was de minimus. Operator : We will take our next question from Greg Van Winkle of Morgan Stanley. Greg Van Winkle : Hey, guys. Is there anything notable you see happening on the demand side of the equation in any of these markets? We certainly see the supply issue but I think if you go back and look at historical cycles, it seems like supply can cause some softening for sure but it takes a shift in demand to really make or break a cycle. So I'm just kind of curious what you're seeing on the demand-side in markets like New York and San Francisco? David Neithercut : Yes, I guess I would say other than New York, demand is very robust. I mean, our occupancies, I think, reflect that being 96% plus. I think the challenge in New York is the disparity between the luxury apartments that have been delivered and will be delivered versus the mix of job growth quality of jobs that are being delivered in New York City. So a lot of tech jobs, a lot of marketing jobs, probably in the $90,000 to $100,000 range, but it takes $130,000 a year in New York City to afford a one-bedroom apartment. So you've got a glut of luxury, a lot of the condos are adding pressure as well. Just a bit of color at our Prism Property, a resident bought one of the condominiums and rented it for $800 less per month than our rents. So it's just there's some crazy stuff going on in New York. Greg Van Winkle : Okay. And then, two, is there anything in particular that's change since mid-March? I think at the Citi Conference, you guys said you were about where you thought you'd be at that time of the year, that may be some markets were doing worse than expected but others were doing better. And that you were about where you thought you would be so was there any one thing or one market that really got a lot worse than since then? Or was it just kind of all of the things you've already talked about, continuing to be an issue? David Neithercut : I think it was mostly New York. We had some significant concessions that ended up as a result. We talked about New York at Citi, the concessions grew through March and ended up being a little larger than we had expected. But other than that, nothing else has really changed. Operator : We will take our next question from Jeffrey Pehl with Goldman Sachs. Jeffrey Pehl : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one on portfolio exposure, how you feel about your current suburban exposure relative to the urban and rest of your portfolio? And then how do you believe your suburban assets versus urban assets will perform in 2016 and 2017? David Neithercut : Well, I guess that we're happy with our allocation. We're in high-density urban kind of markets as well as sort of closed-in walk-able more some suburban locations. We feel that we have an appropriate sort of mix of A's and B's, if you will, within that. We're really focused more, frankly, on markets and as a kind of agnostic, as it relates to property quality. We've talked in the past and I think that we've had a lot of a disproportionate amount of new supply as of late in that in the urban core and they're expecting that to move more out into the suburbs. So I think that, a lot of that performance will be a function of where new supply is and we think that the suburbs might have missed some of it over the last several years but will get their fair share going forward. Operator : We will take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Good morning. David Santee, you mentioned that there was disproportionate increase in vacated premium units during the quarter. Can you clarify how you define premium and were the exit purely a function of new supply or were there other factors that led to this? David Santee : So how we arrived at that is we had this process called early lease termination where people can buy themselves out of their leases for a month-and-a-half to two months' worth of rent. What we saw was a 25% increase in that income quarter over quarter, but really, the same number of lease, early lease terminations as last quarter. So the math tells you that those people that bought themselves out of their lease were paying a much higher rent. John Kim : And how concerning is this to you as a premium rent landlord? David Santee : It was -- it only cropped up in January and February. But, again, I mean, people have different reasons for buying themselves out of the lease, whether they are buying a home or they're getting transferred overseas, what have you, but I think the important thing is, is that the number of people doing this did not change. It just happened to be more high end units. John Kim : Okay and then a question on your development yield on stabilized assets. They trended down over the last couple quarters and I realize this could be due to mix this quarter, Prism was going stabilized development. But overall, did these yields come in below your expectations? David Neithercut : No, generally they were in the ballpark. I think what's happened is that the deals that were started earlier in the cycle with the expectations for higher yields roll off the page, that means those transactions, development projects that have started more recently on that which we knew going in, would have lower yields, remain on the page. I think that generally, we are getting within the ballpark of our expectations and certainly from a value standpoint, I think are exceeding our expectations with respect to the underlining value of those transactions. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Rob Stevenson : David Santee, in your New York attachment in your outlook, are you expecting any softness in jobs in the city in that? David Santee : No, I mean we still see good job growth. I think when you look at the mix of jobs, there's obviously pressure on financial services jobs. And then when you and then really when you just look at the deliveries, as I mentioned in my comments, the Upper West side, Midtown West, you have a lot of deliveries. And there are parts of town that are more appealing or more hip, so to speak, to Millennials or other folks and so there's just more pressure on the Upper West side where we derive 30% of our total revenue. Rob Stevenson : Okay. And then, Mark, I can't remember if it was you or David Neithercut was talking about potentially $380 million or so of development starts during the year, if I look at your development pipeline, there's about 154 million of book value of land. Does that -- if you start that 380 million, does that basically take you down to land parcels for only one or two incremental projects or is there still a decent amount of land for future development on the balance sheet? David Santee : What's on the balance sheet, Rob, is product that would only really go through 2017. We've not been replenishing our land inventory at a rate anywhere close to that at which we've been putting projects under development so the coverage is getting quite bear with respect to land. Rob Stevenson : Okay. And I mean, from the standpoint of out there today, I mean given the commentary of construction, et cetera, are you starting to see any softening, given the -- you guys not being able to hit lease up pro forma, et cetera? Or is it still at the point where between that and condos and other uses, the land prices is just still too rich for to pencil for you guys? David Neithercut : I think the latter. I think you've answered your question. There just continues to be a great deal of demand. A lot in our markets, a lot by the condo side. But it's very difficult for us to pencil. I mean we sold a piece of property in the first quarter because we felt we'd rather monetize the value of the land rather than do the constructions and we didn't think the yield necessarily made sense for that particular location. We continue to underwrite new development potential. We do believe that building new streams and long-term shares of income is a great strategy for us and will be a core competency of ours but as you noted in the tail end of your question, that land pricing is tough. Construction costs are up and yields are down and we just, again, have taken a little bit more of a conservative approach going forward. Recognizing that we have delivered a lot lately, still got a lot underway that we'll deliver in the short-term, all of which, as I noted earlier, is probably getting yields very much close to what we had expected and have created value significantly more than our expectation but we just sort of think we're at a point where we've got to take a little bit more cautious approach. Rob Stevenson : Okay. And then just real quick, lastly, do you guys see any markets where you're seeing any notable condo conversions from apartments? David Neithercut : Not really. Not really. The condo conversion business is a, you know, it's a risky business and our markets requires an awful lot of capital just simply to acquire there what would be a fully-leased rental property and then to go through an extensive renovation of that property and I sell out is just a long process and we have not seen a great deal of that activity in any of our markets. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Tayo Okusanya : Just two quick questions from me. The first one, after sales being pushed back a little bit towards the back half of the year, could you talk a little bit about just how much additional earnings you're getting from that versus the original plan? Where you got your more asset sales a little bit earlier? Mark Parrell : Hi, Tayo. It's Mark Parrell. Sure. So we really shifted things more into the later third and fourth quarter when they had been more evenly spread than before and that's worth somewhere between $6 million and $10 million, depending on when exactly you put those numbers in and that offsets the increase in G&A that I spoke of and the slight decline in NOI and that's why you didn't see our midpoint move. David Neithercut : Let me just follow up on that, Tayo, if I might and this has nothing to do with any change in demand for these assets it's just the process we are going through sort of metering out, just bringing these assets to market in these locations, either Western Massachusetts and in, around Hartford, Connecticut, that we intend to sell. So the process is going about as what we had expected, pricing wise, the amount of interest, et cetera, it's just, we just think it's going to take a little bit more time. But it has nothing to do with any change in the demand for those assets or the valuation of those assets. Tayo Okusanya : Okay. That's helpful. And then your 2Q normalized guidance, the midpoint is $0.76; you came in at $0.77 in 1Q. We're going into a seasonally stronger quarter for you guys. Is the decline purely because of all the asset sales in 1Q? Mark Parrell : Well, they start with $0.76 because that was this quarter. We reported $0.76 and at this point is $0.76 again. I mean when we're looking at next quarter, we do see increases both in same store and in non-same store, but what you're really going to have happen is the impact of some of this disposition income sequentially. Because remember, we did own Starwood for one month of the first quarter so that's why you really see that lift that usually comes between Q1 and Q2 and FFO gets muted and be about flat. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Alex Goldfarb, Sandler O'Neill. Alex Goldfarb : Yes, good morning out there. Just a few questions here, first, David Santee, did you say that as you guys were planning 2016, the seasonality you were mirroring 2015 or that's just as you're looking at the situation now? David Santee : So when we gave our guidance, which we gave I think back in October on our Q3 call, the assumptions were, was that we would not, we wouldn't see any seasonality enter the market just as we did not see the seasonality in Q4 of 2014 and Q1 of 2015. We assumed the same turnover and we assumed rate growth would be actually identical to what we experienced in 2015. So when you look at our top line, you want to refer to it as the rent roll. We are trailing behind that a tad, so can we make that up and still achieve our month over month growth targets? Certainly we could, but we feel prudent to assume that we did see seasonality creep back in, in Q1. We can only assume that 2015 was an anomaly year and that it will creep back in, in 2000, I'm sorry, in Q4 of this year and beyond. Alex Goldfarb : But just sort of curious, I mean, 2015 surprised a lot of people with how strong it was at this point in the cycle. So just sort of curious, why you guys thought then that 2016 would mirror 2015 versus a more normalized year, if last year surprised most people with its strength? David Santee : Well, I guess when you look at the key revenue, drivers of revenue, we're pretty much on target, we're pretty much on target on occupancy. I mean, we could have stronger occupancy in the peak leasing season. We're ahead on our renewal rate expectations and really, a lot of the rate growth that we're discounting guidance from is in New York City. So I think New York City just turned very quickly and more deeply than we expected, and but is already showing signs of kind of returning to normal. I mean, new lease rents are still under pressure, but we're still doing well on occupancy. We're 98% plus occupancy there. And so I really think it's just New York is 20% of our revenue. So if you can't, roughly 20% of our revenue so if you can't achieve 3% or 4% rate growth there, then it's going to impact your full-year growth. David Neithercut : Let's put this a little bit into perspective, Alex. You know, we're still within our range. We had within our range for this year the possibility, the potential that the 2016 occupancy curve would look like 2015. And it's not and so we're, but we're still within our range and the change in this guidance is just 10-plus basis points, 20 basis points and it's still delivering with what year is, on a historical basis, extraordinarily good results. So I just want to put all this in perspective. Alex Goldfarb : I appreciate that. And then the second question is on New York, just given absence of 421a and it doesn't seem like anything is going to get resolved soon, it would almost seem like the market is set up to accelerate the absorption of all the supply if new development starts to decline. As the surge at year-end last year, as that stuff gets to the pipeline, it would seem like New York could actually accelerate given the lack of new supply going forward. Do you guys have a view on that? David Neithercut : I guess we're tracking supply across our markets, Alex, and then maybe just the best way to address the question is to go back to one of the prior questions about what we're seeing about demand and absorption. We continue to see a significant amount of demand to live in these markets, to live in these kinds of properties. And in Seattle and in DC, where we had a lot of new supply, that was absorbed and occupancy stayed very strong and in Seattle, we saw, still saw a very strong revenue growth. We think the demand will continue to be very strong in New York. As David said, we are already beginning to see some recovery from a little bit of softening that we saw in the first quarter. We don't really see supply that we think is going to really overwhelm that demand. We might lose a little pricing power from time to time but long-term everything is pointing upwards and to the right. Operator : We will take our next question from Kris Trafton with Credit Suisse. Kris Trafton : Hi, guys. I just wanted to circle back quickly on Northern California and what you're seeing in leasing there? Could you maybe compare what you're seeing with Potrero versus maybe Vista 99s in San Francisco versus San Jose, and then maybe compare what you're seeing in San Francisco now versus maybe Mission Bay lease-up and towards the middle or end of last year? David Neithercut : Well, I guess it's a little difficult to kind of compare some of these but I guess, I'll tell you that the absorption at Potrero has been very strong. We had pro forma 25 units a month and we've been doing 36 units a month. Out of Vista 99 we pro forma 20 a month, and we've been doing 37 a month, and at rates that are actually better than what we had expected. The thing I'll just caution you about those absorption levels, at the very early stages of leasing, you tend to get a lot of absorption because you've been taking names and building a wait-list and so you kind of have a little rush through the front door and so you don't want to be carried away by those statistics that you see early on. But at least, all signs are that we're going to do very well there, both at those two transactions, both with respect absorption levels as well as to the rental rates that we'll achieve. And as we're dealing with or near, kind of completing in Mission Bay, we leased a 27 units a month which exceeded our absorption levels and essentially getting rates that were right in the wheelhouse of what we expected. Kris Trafton : Great. That's really helpful. And then just one other question on when you announced the Starwood deal, you were pretty explicit in terms of not being able to get any G&A savings. I guess one, one, what changed from that? And then two, what would be like a good run rate for G&A going forward maybe in 2017? Mark Parrell : So, it's Mark. We said there wouldn't be any savings in G&A and indeed, there isn't at this point. We moved the midpoint of our G&A, guidance actually up just now to account for some severance cost that we discussed earlier in the call. I certainly think that the midpoint now at $59 million will be considerably lower next year. I'm not sure that I'm ready to say exactly what that is. I'd also expect that property management will go down. I mean we have severance costs in both of those lines. We have run rates of employees that were part of our Denver and South Florida portfolios. So I mean those numbers will generally decline, offset by just the normal raises and resets of accruals and stuff. But I'm not sure I can give you an exact number for overhead at this point. Operator : We'll take our next question from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay : You guys highlighted supply pressures in various submarkets. I'm wondering how much of this is just transitory? Do you see it persisting into 2017 for any of the submarkets? David Santee : This is David Santee. So Boston is probably a good example of where a good majority of the new deliveries has been in, call it, a two-mile radius of the financial district where we re-derived an outsized portion of our revenue. When you look at occupancy over the last several years, you still maintain 96% plus occupancy. You've still been able to achieve renewal rate growth. You're just not getting any new lease pricing power. With a lot of those units delivered and fully leased up, there is nothing coming online until the first of '17. So, we will see as we enter peak leasing season, if pricing power returns to that market, but I guess I would say every market is different. I mean, Seattle, we delivered considerable new product that goes head-to-head with some of our communities, but the demand has been so great from the growth in Amazon jobs downtown, it had zero impact on the new -- on our existing same store assets. So I think it's more of a market-by-market discussion. Operator : We'll take our next question from Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities. Tom Lesnick : Thanks. Just a quick one from me. Switching gears entirely, but looking at the Archstone portfolio and given the age of some of those assets, what's the remaining CapEx requirement there? Can you provide us some sense as to how far long you are in refreshing that portfolio? David Neithercut : Well, I guess I don't have any specific statistics for you on that portfolio alone, Tom. But I will tell you that we have identified opportunities in those assets, as we have in our own but we do rehab, kitchen and bath rehabs and refreshing opportunities in those assets. And we think we'll deliver a very strong return in the mid-teens and we are in the process of going about that. With respect to general CapEx, our assessment was we've got those assets, if those were not lacking, then starve the capital in any respect but we are addressing the opportunities we believe that there will be in the interior. So I would think that the run rate to CapEx for those assets would be not too dissimilar to the run rate of CapEx of our assets of similar vintage. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next from Pete Peikidis with Zelman and Associates. Ivy Zelman : Hey, good afternoon guys. It's actually Ivy Zelman. Thank you for taking my question. I really appreciate all the detail and disclosure you provided. I've just -- really into New York City, recognizing you talked about an initiative, I think David, you talked about how you tried to hold the lines but then you had to capitulate to the questions that you saw. Do you have any way to frame that in terms of like the type of incentives? Is it like one-month free rent, three months, and just thinking about the portfolio at large, how does that compare to your strategy on normalizing a lot of operators given those months free and some exclude -- increase it to three months or they get cash? So that's my first question and I have a follow-up please. David Santee : Yes, I mean, when you look at our -- when I look at our concession line, we virtually run concession free, so to speak. In the last downturn, we had or in 2001, we had $40 million in concessions. In the last downturn, we were down to $4 million in concessions. So, we really believe in our net effective pricing program, and we try not to confuse the customer with whether it's $3,000 gift cards, which is, it's really not an administrative task that I would like to take on. So, it just became clear that has concessions, whether it was the gift cards, whether it was too much free or whether it was free vacuum cleaners, what have you, people would come in and prospects and expect, what are you going to give me. And basically our response is this is our rate. They had no point of reference, whether that rate compared to what someone else was offering them, whether it was the gift card or more free months' rent. So we started to see pressure on occupancy. We are more focused perhaps on providing incentives at the broker level versus at the prospect level. But that's what we saw and it started the impact on our occupancy so we ended up doing some concessions late March, late February, and through March, that really cost us about 50 basis points in growth in, for the quarter in New York. Ivy Zelman : And just to follow-up on that, so that has now diminished in terms of the need for the concessions and recognizing as a companywide, it's really only New York City where those concessions accelerated for the quarter? David Santee : Yes. As an example, and we have a look-forward that allows us to look forward, concessions in New York were probably $600,000. We expect them to be below $200,000 in April and even lower in May. Ivy Zelman : That's great. Thank you for that. And my follow up question just relates to a question earlier about, you mentioned the lack of condo conversion and the costs and expenses, that makes tremendous sense. But on the flip side in New York City, there's a tremendous amount of for sale condos that's also coming delivered at this year and next and there's estimates, not my estimate, but estimates out there that it, for several, five years I've heard so a lot of the condo developers that are privately held companies are contemplating, maybe reconfiguring or going to the rental market. What, in fact, have you heard on that front or is that a potential headwind that you may not have incorporated into your outlook? David Neithercut : We haven't heard that, Ivy, yet. We have seen it in the past in markets that sort of had a lot of condo inventory that is not selling and people had sort of switched to apartments. You know, while it certainly is apartment supply, many of those properties that we've seen in the past are significantly larger units than ours. They are significantly better appointed and better pictured and so the rents on those are significantly higher. It's tough to compare a one-bedroom apartment property we've got with a brand new one bedroom that might be 50% larger in size with the amenities and you know, features of an apart, of a condo property that's switched. So while it certainly is inventory, it's often not inventory that competes directly with us. Operator : With no further questions, I'd like to turn it back to our presenters for any closing remarks. David Neithercut : Great. Thank you all for your time today. As we noted, it continues to be a very good time in the apartment space. We look forward to delivering another year of very good results for you and look forward to seeing everybody in the upcoming conferences. Thank you very much for your time. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being recorded. Now at this time, I'll turn the call to your host Marty McKenna. Please go ahead sir. Marty McKenna : Thanks, Jay. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential\u2019s second quarter 2016 results and outlook for the year. Our featured speakers today are David Neithercut, our President and CEO; David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Parrell, our CFO. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. And now I'll turn over to David Neithercut. David Neithercut : Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. Clearly 2016 will not turn out to be the year we had originally expected due to deteriorating market conditions in San Francisco and New York City, which combined made up 50% of our initial growth forecast for the year. As David Santee will address in greater detail in just a moment. At the time of our first quarter earnings call nearly all indicators suggested that while the top end of our original expectations was off the table another year of solid up with 4% growth in same-store revenue was most likely. As strong demand continued to absorb new supply with little impact to existing inventory. The month of May however brought sudden and material changes to the fundamental picture particularly San Francisco and a 50 basis point reduction in the Company\u2019s expected revenue growth for the year. Last 60 days fundamentals have continued to weaken in this markets causing us to yet again reduce our expectations for full year of revenue growth, in which for the first time in many years we now expected to have a free handle. And as a result after five years of extraordinarily strong fundamentals revenue growth this year will not be more in line with historical trends. Like many of the participants on today\u2019s call, we too would prefer revenue growth with a four, or even at a five handle but markets do reset from time to time either due to new supply or changes in the demand side of equation. Unfortunately, the present time we\u2019re experiencing both factors in two of our most important markets. The weakness we\u2019re experiencing in San Francisco, New York City is driving reductions in our revenue growth expectations for the year. So with that said I\u2019ll let David Santee go in to more detail about what\u2019s occurred over the last 60 to 90 days, how it\u2019s impacted us during the primary leasing season and our expected results for the year. David Santee : Okay. Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. This morning I\u2019ll address or advice same-store revenue guidance and give you some color on overall operations. As Boston, DC, Seattle and Southern California are all generally performing in line with our expectations. I\u2019ll focus my commentary on San Francisco and New York. We welcome any questions you have on our other markets in the Q&A. Today Mark will address our same-store expenses in his remarks. As David said in his comment, we would not meet revenue expectations that we announced in June and that is due in large part, to the continued volatility that we\u2019re seeing in San Francisco and to a lesser extent New York as these markets work to absorb new supply. Together these two markets accounted for approximately 50% of our expected revenue growth in 2016. The deterioration in both markets is driving more volatility than we have experienced in our portfolio over the last half dozen years. Now that markets are less stable as a result of elevated supply and pressure on the highly compensated job sector optimizing occupancy comes at a cost for rate growth. Now when we gave revised guidance in June, San Francisco new lease rents had gone from being up 5% in Q1 down to flat in a matter of weeks. We assumed as a result of some of the irrational pricing we saw on new lease-ups, that we would see rates deteriorate further into negative territory. But that we could still achieve similar occupancy as we move through peak leasing season. We felt comfortable about occupancy because the last week of May occupancy was 20 basis points higher than the same week last year and exposure was 20 basis points lower. We thought certainly if Seattle could absorb elevated supply with minimal disruption, San Fran could do the same. Our forecast for San Francisco new lease rents to go negative proved to be true very quickly as new lease rents are now negative 3% versus same week last year. Unfortunately over the next four weeks our occupancy assumptions for San Francisco missed the mark and today we sit at 95.8% occupied, a 110 basis points lower than the same week last year. The deterioration of both metrics and the knowledge that new supply continues to be delivered in to rest of this year and heavily in the first half of next has led us to lower our full year growth expectation for San Francisco to be around 6.5%, down from our expected 7.75% in June and the original 9.5% growth we expected when we gave you our original guidance in Q4 of last year. San Francisco accounted for about a third of our same-store revenue growth in 2016 and so this decline along with New York City accounts for the 100 basis points off of the entire portfolio. In San Francisco, we have seen a sizable amount of new supply over 8,000 units being delivered in 2016 and it is all at the high end of the market. This supply has hit the market at the same time that job growth in the tech sector has hit the pause button. We still see good demand for units as evidenced by how well our newly completed developments are leasing up. But we are feeling the impact of our target demographic having more choices than before. In the second quarter, our lease over lease Delta was up 2.1%, in July was up 95 basis points, while renewals were up 8.6%. Occupancy was 96.2% and turnover excluding same property transfers increased 30 basis points from same quarter last year. Through Q2 turnover excluding transfers is down 30 basis points from 25% to 24.7%. Looking forward new lease rents are expected to remain in the minus 3% range for July and August, our renewals achieved for July are 8% and currently 6.9% for August. Again, occupancy is 95.8%, but is on the expected seasonal upswing as students return to school. Now switching to New York, when we gave guidance in June, it was clear that New York was going to deteriorate further. We are comfortable that we have forecasted the appropriate mix of rate and occupancy for the balance of the year. New York job growth expectations were at the time stable. While the economy there appears to be on solid footing and the overall job growth is at expected levels. The bulk of job added today are mid-level compensation types jobs dominated by hospitality, leisure, followed by healthcare. Professional services, our demographic typically the higher paying jobs held by our target demographic was a close third. The New York market continues to work to absorb approximately nearly 9,000 units this year and with the great majority of that supply at the high end absorption has not been as robust as we would expect. As a result, it\u2019s possible that 2016 deliveries will carry over into 2017 lease ups. We are already expecting a more elevated pipeline of new products scheduled for delivery in both 2017 and 2018. The concern in New York is that these elevated levels of supply mainly private and fee managers to elevate upfront move in concessions beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016. Now in our shop as we immediately take a cash charge in our same-store revenue of the full concession in the month of move-in our revenue stream would be more impacted this year than if we amortize those concessions over the term of the lease. For example, year-to-date we would have reported a 4.5% if we have straight-line concessions versus the 4.4% that we reported. As a result sequential quarter over quarter and full year revenue growth will be more impacted this year. Much of the new supply delivered in 2016 has been focused on the left side Jersey City and Brooklyn, all very competitive to our same-store portfolio in the market. 2017 we\u2019ll see deliveries across a number of submarkets especially Long Island City and Brooklyn, but the left side we\u2019ll see continued deliveries as well. Our current expectation for full year same-store revenue growth for New York is now around 1.5%, which is down from the 2.25% growth expectation, we had at the beginning of June and the 3.75% growth expectation we had to start the year. New York accounted for about 15% of our expected 2016 same-store revenue growth. In the second quarter, our lease over lease Delta was minus 80 basis points, in July is minus 95 basis point. Renewal rates achieved were 4.3% for the quarter with July at 3.3%. Renewals achieved thus far for August and September are 3.4% and 2.8% respectively. Turnover excluding same-store, same property transfers increased a 100 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 10.1% and a 100 basis points year to-date to 17.4%. Today occupancy is 96.2% with new lease rates slightly negative. Now before I close I want to assure you that no one is more disappointed about having to lower our guidance again and more than the entire team here at EQR as well as myself. I can also say that each stop along the way we were diligently to give you our best estimate at the time based on our collective experience. As David said at the end of April occupancy, exposure, turnover, renewal rents, new lease rents, all indicated another good year in San Francisco. Unfortunately as we continue to increase rents in May, the market decided to get conservative and we had to react accordingly. We are obviously experiencing extremely volatile markets and this volatility is very difficult to predict. Perhaps in hindsight we were initially over optimistic on San Francisco given the levels of new supply bottom line this year, but based on our dashboards at the end of April and later in the early June, we would never have predicted the falloff in new lease rents and occupancy that we experience today. David? David Neithercut : Okay. Thank you, David. As noted in last night\u2019s earnings release, we\u2019ve also made some changes toward expected transaction activity for the year. Dispositions have now been reduced to $6.9 billion down from $7.4 billion. This $500 million reduction has resulted three factors. First, about a $150 million of the non-Boston [indiscernible] assets that are in various stages of the disposition process. We\u2019ll not likely close this year, will carry over into the first quarter of 2017. Second, the original disposition guidance included a $200 million portfolio of assets we have decided to hold for the present time as we see continued upside in both operations and valuations there and think that sale at this time would be premature. And lastly, as noted in last night\u2019s release, we did not acquire any assets in the second quarter and reduced our acquisitions expectations for the year by $150 million. Since any incremental acquisitions will be funded by sales proceeds we\u2019ve reduced dispositions by a similar amount. During the second quarter we did sell three non-core assets for $112.5 million at 5.7% disposition yield and a 9.3% unleveraged IRR. In addition to selling these assets in Arizona, Massachusetts and Connecticut, last quarter we also sold our entire interest in the military housing at Joint Base Lewis McChord in Tacoma, Washington, in realizing a gain of $52.4 million. Now we\u2019ve been involved with Lewis McChord since 2002 during which time we renovated over 2200 homes and built more than 800 new homes for men and women who called the McChord Joint Base Home while serving our country. We\u2019re very proud of our work at Lewis McChord last 14 years and it was really our honor and privilege to be involved there. With regard to our development business we commenced construction of the one small development project in the second quarter in Washington D.C., we\u2019re billing 222 units or $88 million or $396,000 a unit. At an expected yield on cost at today\u2019s rents in the mid 5s. The deal was in the NoMa market and will be delivered in late 2018 and is expected to stabilize in late 2019. We\u2019re also currently working on two small projects totaling $90 million that could start construction yet this year, with a weighted average cost on at today\u2019s rents in the mid to high 5s. During the second quarter, we also completed construction in our lease-up of three new development deals all in the San Francisco market, two Downtown and one in North San Jose. These assets are leasing extremely well and are experiencing monthly absorption rates in excess of original expectations. From a pricing standpoint like our same-store portfolio we\u2019re not achieving the rents we\u2019d hoped at the beginning of the year, but the rents we are achieving are well in access of those underwritten at the time these sites were acquired and constructions commenced. And as a result these assets will provide stabilized yields from the high 5s to high 7s, which are well in excess of our original expectations. I\u2019ll turn the call now over to Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Thank you, David. Today, I\u2019ll be giving some color behind our same-store expense guidance and the change to our normalized FFO guidance. I\u2019ll then discuss how the change to our normalized FFO guidance impacted the remaining special dividend payment and our debt issuance guidance. In all these cases I\u2019m comparing the guidance numbers we gave you in late April 2016 as part of our first quarter earnings call to the revised guidance that we provided last night. As you might recall the June 1 press release only revised our same-store revenue and NOI ranges. So moving onto the same-store expense side, we have left our annual same-store expense range at an increase of 2.5% to 3% and this is not withstanding the fact that same-store expenses year-to-date have only grown by 0.9%. This implies so we expect second half same-store expenses to grow at a considerably higher rate of about 4.6%. As usual our big three expense categories of real estate taxes, utilities, and payroll will drive these numbers.  We now expect property taxes to increase at a rate of about 6% versus our previous expectation in our year-to-date number of 5.5%. This increase is due to a recent adverse legal decision regarding the calculation of property taxes, with several of our properties in New Jersey City. We also previously forecast payroll growth up 2.5% to 3% and we still believe that forecast to be accurate. Year-to-date payroll has only increased 0.3%, so we see most of the expected increase in payroll as backend loaded.  For the year, we expect utilities expense to decline by approximately 3%, year-to-date utilities expenses down 8.1%. Mostly expected growth in the second half on the utility side is due to our expectation of somewhat higher commodity prices later in this year as compared to the historically low commodity prices we have in the third and fourth quarters of 2015. Moving onto normalized FFO, the reduction in the same-store NOI from a midpoint back in April of 5.5% to a midpoint now of 4%, causes a normalized FFO reduction of about $23 million or about $0.06 per share. Going the other way an increase in our normalized FFO estimate we now expect an additional $4 million in NOI or about $0.01 per share for the positive due to the reduction in dispositions combined with these asset sales being pushed back further into the year.  David Neithercut previously discussed the reasons for this reduction in our disposition activity. Our reduction in acquisition guidance from $600 million to $350 million and disposition guidance from $7.4 billion to $6.9 billion has only had a very modest impact on the amount of taxable gain that we only incur in 2016 and need the special dividend. This is because the specific assets that we removed from our disposition guidance just specifically at relatively little tax gain and because we have already paid with the $8 per share March 2016 special dividend, the preponderance of the tax gain that we will incur in 2016. We therefore left our guidance for the annual special dividend in the range of $2 to $4 per share with the thought that the ultimate amount that we will pay is likely to be at or slightly lower than that midpoint. Our guidance assumes that this payment will be made in the fourth quarter of 2016. All dividend payments are subject still to the approval of our Board of Trustee. Moving on to the debt side, because our next disposition activity is about $250 million lower than we expected back in April our projected line balance at December 31, 2016 is anticipated to now be about $430 million versus the $130 million we previously estimated. For now we have left our debt issuance guidance at about $225 million. But if our disposition process goes as expected we may do a larger offering than is now included in our guidance in either the secured or unsecured markets later in 2016. And I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to the operator for the question-and-answer session period. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll hear first from Nick Joseph, Citigroup. Go ahead please. Michael Bilerman : Hey, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Nick. Santee, thanks for the color surrounding from the guidance moves and look we can certainly appreciate you in the short-term business. Your portfolio is more concentrated in the two of the biggest markets that you are in have some more volatility. And I don\u2019t want to get into the specifics of the numbers, but I want to focus on your processes and procedures in terms of forecasting and the results. And there was many of us have been to your offices, we've seen all the reams of data, we\u2019ve seen all the pricing systems that you have and you\u2019ve now reduced guidance three times. So we were trying to figure out sort of what are the issues in terms of, is your assets forecasting system, not driving the right rates and so are the inputs not right or the outputs not right is it in operations issue or is it a FP&A issue that\u2019s causing this because you can have one strike, two strikes, but doing it three times, one could imagine that there are other issues at play here than just the market in terms of how the data is coming in relative to your expectation and also what you put out to the street. And on the slight side, I don\u2019t think a 500 unit building sort of popped up overnight, It would be input that you would, so maybe other, I don\u2019t know if you want to take that, but sort of give some color around some of the processes and procedures that are going on. David Santee : Well. I guess I would say that our process is very collaborative. These decisions are not made in a vacuum. There is probably six of us that run our models from different perspectives, but at the end of the day, we all kind of lined up in the same place. I think a lot of the volatility has been very quick and at very in opportune times. One of the things that makes it very difficult to forecast is when we look at the precipitous drop and new lease rents in San Francisco. And look, we\u2019ve had Boston, DC, all of these other markets have delivered outsized supply, but have relatively strong occupancy. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we were prepared for rents to go down. When you look at the new lease ups, if the new lease ups are giving one month free basically you can move into a brand new building at 2015 rent. If new a lease up is giving two months free, you could move into a brand new building at 2014 rent. I think to some extent, we are a victim of our own success on the renewal side. When you look at San Francisco 35% of our expirations are almost 5% above current street rents and with volatility ranging from plus 2% to as much as down 10% at certain properties in San Francisco it really comes down to who moves out and at what property do they move out of. I mean at with rents down 10% a person could be 6% above current market rents, a 16% decline on $4,000 month rent and at times a couple 100, couple 300, each month for a couple of months winds down your revenue stream pretty quickly. So I hope that gives you a little more granular explanation of why it is very difficult to predict \u2013the rate of decline that we can expect especially in the peak season where you have 15% of your leases expiring in June, July and August, each month. So extreme volatility, with the highest number of transactions in the year, with job growth really coming to a halt at the high end of the market, is just making it very difficult to forecast forward. New York is kind of in the same boat 45% of our expirations. Michael Bilerman : You don\u2019t think it\u2019s an input issue for how you are managing your business in terms of, you know, that you\u2019re just sort of rolling with market. I think the market has come to expect that you have a little bit better insight into the day-to-day incident especially the time where you had to already lower guidance twice, one would imagine the second time you did it, one would hope that you\u2019ve built enough conservatism. I guess what I\u2019m really asking is the whole processes that you have in place off, right? Is it not producing what you wanted to produce? The markets going to do what the market's going to do you\u2019ve built some tools and you seem to be disproportionately having to play catch up a little bit. And so that's what I'm more curious is about the processes and procedures you have rather than what's happening in to the marketplace. David Santee : Well. I guess I would say that our processes that we have in place especially at the top level, the company level, certainly worked with a lot of big numbers. Certainly I don't think with fixed markets today, that you would expect us to give or see us give guidance in October. I think that some of the \u2013 I mean basically I think that we were overly optimistic about San Francisco. And really just kind of mirrored at some point in time judgment has to come into play. But what's different also about California, is that California is a 30-day market. All of our other markets are 60-day market so you have a longer runway to see, who is giving notice. You have longer runway to react to pricing and what have you. And so this is, the San Francisco in the 30-day market with these dramatic changes within 30-days and is just very hard to forecast and very hard to react as quickly to adjust. David Neithercut : Let me just add one thing there Michael, just general serve the philosophy we have with respect to this. Our intent every time is to give our investors our best guess as to how we see our business performing going forward. Not 90% of that best guess or 80% percent of that best guess, or 75% of the best guess but rather our best guess based upon the tools we have at our disposal, bills we have on the ground and the judgment of people who have been doing this for a awful long time. It's not intended to give you the range of all possible outcomes, but those outcomes that we think are most probable based upon the tools that we have in the judgment that we use. And as David said, these markets have turned to become quite volatile, it's become far more difficult to do that, but each step of the way we try and give you our best guess and again, whereas David said, we are as disappointed as anyone about where we are relative to where we ended up but, we believe we have an obligation to be as transparent with the Street as we can. And to give them our absolute best guess, not build in all sorts of cushion but to tell out like we see it. And we think we have done that every step of the way and it is just difficult to do so when things are moving and moving very quickly in markets that were budgeted to deliver 50% of our growth. Michael Bilerman : Yes, okay. Thanks for the time. David Santee : You\u2019re very welcome. Operator : Now moving to our next question David Bragg, Green Street Advisors. Go ahead please. David Bragg : Thank you. Good morning. David Santee : Good morning, Dave. David Bragg : You still have a reputation as an operator that can outperform or perform in-line with your comps in your markets. What can you share regarding how your portfolio is performing relative to your comps in your markets? David Santee : Well, when you \u2013 if you want to talk, markets and submarket, I think if you look at San Francisco, we\u2019ve delivered a 9.9% CAGR over the last four or five years. I think if you look back over the last five years, I think all but one we had the highest revenue growth especially in San Francisco. You know, we \u2013 after every quarter, we kind of take our portfolio \u2013 because a lot of this is just about location, location, location, location. One of our competitors in Boston, they have fewer properties. We have many properties. We go through an exercise where we take our properties that are in, the two or three properties that are in the suburbs and the other two or three properties that are up North, and we look at our \u2013 we create a similar portfolio to our competitors. And I would say that, every time we are very comfortable with our performance when we create similar portfolios to our competitors. David Bragg : Thanks, David. So I think your investors are trying to discern the degree to which you are having forecasting versus execution challenges and you're saying that, as far as you can tell, there's no difference in the execution relative to that of your peers this year, than in the past. Is that fair? David Santee : Yes. That is fair. And I would add a comment. In the case of San Francisco, I don't think it's, you know any surprise or secret, that some of our competitors, have agreed or self-imposed renewal limits. Where we have not done that. That is also been a key driver of our leading the market in San Francisco for the last four, five years. But at the same time, when you reach an inflection point and the market comes down very quickly, we're going to come down just as quick and we\u2019re going to come down much harder than our competitors. So, again, I \u2013 we will go through this exercise again after everyone reports. And we will matchup our head to head properties with theirs. And like previous years, I expect that our execution will prove to be very good. David Bragg : Okay. Thank you for that. And a question for David Neithercut, what are your thoughts \u2013 how does this experience so far this year inform you\u2019re thinking on your strategy? Are the markets and submarkets that you're in truly as high barrier as you believed? And they\u2019re clearly priced in the private market for superior NOI growth, which at least over the near-term is not what was expected. To what extent is the transaction market for these assets weakening along with the fundamentals? David Neithercut : Well. I think they might be priced for superior total return over extended time period. And I just simply the NOI growth in the short-term. I'd say the assets in these markets continue to trade at very low cap rate stage with three handles. In some instances even through a three handle there continues to be perhaps not as much demand, but certainly sufficient demand for these hard assets that in these Gateway cities that we've not seen any change in value at least for the present time. Now there may be because there might be fewer tours and potentially fewer buyers, maybe did ask spreads widening in certain instances, but the transaction that we are seeing getting done in the market in which we operate that continues to support the valuations that we've been talking about. Just with respect to strategy, I think we've gone in with our eyes wide open that by operating in fewer markets were likely to have more volatility. But again, we think these are the markets that are going to create jobs and these are the markets where people are going to want to live, work and play and they\u2019ll perform best over the long-term. As David noted, we've had 10% compounded annual growth rate in San Francisco over the past five years. If it was flat jobs \u2013 flat revenue growth for the next five, over 10 years it would still be 4.5 which is very, very strong revenue growth. So we remain very committed to the markets we are in. We think that again these are the place where the economy going forward will drive and that we\u2019ll see better overall risk adjusted total returns in these markets. We've seen construction costs continue to go up in these markets and replacement costs going up. But I guess I'd also say that in these markets, while there is elevated or more supply than we\u2019ve seen in the past as a percentage of existing inventory, these are troubling amounts of new supply and in a historical context, unprecedented levels of new supply. So it's more than we\u2019ve seen, it's disrupting us somewhat but a governance by just our lease ups particularly in San Francisco that you\u2019ve gone extraordinarily well, demand is there. And we couldn't be happy with the product we\u2019re delivering and will outperform our original expectations and we think we are in the right place for a long-term perspective. David Bragg : Okay. Thank you for that. One last one if I may, in light of the underperformance of the stock and the fact that it's discounted on an absolute basis and cheaper than its peer set or cheaper than it's ever been, versus its peer set, can you update us on what you can do proactively to attempt to narrow the discount between the private and public market values? What are you evaluating or thinking about doing in terms of asset sales or joint ventures? David Neithercut : I guess we\u2019re selling almost $7 billion of product of this year and returning a significant amount of that back to our shareholders in the leverage neutral basis. So I'm not sure there's anybody who's done more this year than we have in that regard. But I guess as I've said, too many of our investors that [indiscernible] and have said repeatedly, I mean everything is on the table. We are up-to-date painfully aware of where the stock price trades relative to those values. And we'll pursue and consider everything. I\u2019d just would reiterate what I think I've said on our last call and certainly as evidenced by the gains that we\u2019ve realized on those assets that we've sold as part of this larger process. We've got significant gains in almost everything we\u2019ve owned. I think we\u2019ve been very good capital allocators and we made a lot of money. And as a result of that, by the time after one looks at the gains of assets and run those things on the balance sheet repo basis, if things went off on a lot of asset sales to have any real impact on stock buybacks. So it's just been more challenging than what I think many investors might think. But everything is always on the table and will look at everything between now and the end of the year. David Bragg : Thank you. David Neithercut : You\u2019re welcome, David. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019re now moving to next caller Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Rich Hightower : Hey good morning, guys. Thanks for taking\u2026 David Neithercut : Good morning, Rich. Rich Hightower : So I wanted to hit on David Nethercutt\u2019s comment earlier on the probable outcome versus the range of outcomes with respect to guidance. So specifically on the topic of the range of outcome, how bad you think San Francisco and/or New York could actually get? And then, I don't believe this was actually answered earlier, but does the guidance as it currently stands build in some cushion against current trends as you described them or as it simply a extrapolated what you are seeing in the market currently? David Santee : Well, this is David Santee. Someone asked me could New York, be negative? It\u2019s certainly possible. I mean we are focused more on this year. We certainly have as I noted in my comments, we are already seeing a lot of the marketing employees in New York, one private company is offering a $1,000 gift card on any rental. So we are just kind of playing off there at knowing that we were kind of forced to use can set upfront concessions in Q1 in New York. Knowing that the level of supply that's still in Lisa, knowing what's coming next year \u2013 we have built-in what we think are necessary levels of concessions or commissions or what have you to get us through the end of the year. Rich Hightower : Okay. And the same would apply in San Francisco? David Santee : Yes, we really haven't seen a lot of the marketing items or move-in concessions, for that matter are in the legacy portfolio. I mean the only concessions that we have seen thus far, are on the new lease ups. And I think people are rushing to get these buildings filled. Whether it's because they have occupancy requirements by their lender or a variety of other reasons. But we really haven't seen anything out of the ordinary other than rapidly declining new lease rents and less demand on the older type property. Rich Hightower : Okay. Thanks, David. And one quick question on the demand side of the equation, so and it's not something unique to what EQR is doing this quarter. But it does seem that there has been a shift in tone or shift in the data perhaps with respect to tech sector job growth or wage growth or both. Would you say that is a material shift in what you're seeing in your tenant base or perspective tenant base versus three or six months ago? David Santee : Absolutely. I mean if you look at the data, first it was, DC funding. Then your tech jobs, the high-paying tech jobs peaked in Q1 of 2016. I just read the other day, DC spending was down another 20% in Q2. So certainly, the tech jobs are not growing at the pace that they were last year. If they are growing at all. But at the same time folks that lived in a 30-year-old, two-story walk-up paying you know, $3,000 for a one bedroom, can move uptown into a brand-new, highly amenitized, glass tower with gorgeous views of the San Francisco Bay for about the same money. So the people that can afford it are moving into the better properties, but then there's less demand for the older properties as a result the further you get down the peninsula as a result of a lower job growth in the tech sector. Rich Hightower : All right. Thanks, David. David Santee : Thank you, Rich. Operator : And now, Nick Yulico with UBS. Please go ahead. Nick Yulico : Thanks, everyone. Just going back to the visibility question. I'm wondering as we were now almost through seven months of the year in a lot of the prime leasing season, can you quantify how much of the year's revenue results are sort of baked in and not at risk. Assuming you don't have a meaningful occupancy problem. I mean is it 60% or is it something higher? Can you give us some visibility into August and September at this point. So I'm trying to figure out, with all debate out, may be what happens in 2017. How much debate is a really left about what could happen in 2016 versus your guidance? David Santee : Well, and that's a great question. Because over the last, six, seven years we've kind of always said, once you get to August or September that your year is really baked. And if we look back, the last six or seven years, all of the markets really had the same momentum, I mean all of the markets went down in the great recession. And then all of the markets kind of came up together. During those years, you really had virtually no new supply to speak of. So it was very easy to forecast just based on momentum. Certainly when you get to August, the rate portion that drives revenue growth in the current year is baked. I mean, those there's just not enough transactions remaining in the year to meaningfully impact the full year revenue. But what can meaningfully change your revenue September, October, November, December is certainly occupancy and more importantly concessions. Because as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, if we give a full month concession, that's an 8% discount that we take a full charge on in that month. So if concessions \u2013 upfront concessions really ramp up, which we are not a fan of where we tried to be a net effective rent shop. Then that will seriously impact your revenue stream, in that month and for the next that couple of months. Nick Yulico : So obviously \u2013 I don't know if you gave this or not, I think you may have given just it for New York and San Francisco but where is sort of overall occupancy in the portfolio as of today? David Santee : Overall occupancy today, I think is 95.9. And some of these markets like Boston is a little lower because Boston is a heavy student oriented market. But occupancies and SoCal are great, probably a little bit better than we expected. Washington DC's occupancy is right where we thought it would be. Seattle is doing great and accelerating. So again physical occupancy is not necessarily the driver of revenue. A dollar \u2013 assuming, occupancy is worth $1, occupancy in San Francisco is worth $1.50, right? Versus a point of occupancy in Inland Empire might be worth $0.75. Physical occupancy does not necessarily translate into economic occupancy. Nick Yulico : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess David Neithercut or Mark Parrell, how much room is sort of left to do more asset sales this year from a tax standpoint special dividend standpoint, if you wanted to do a stock buyback \u2013 I mean, at what point does the board start thinking about doing something more strategic about a stock buyback is it a period of several quarters for the stock to really trade at a discount of [indiscernible] or I mean how should we sort of think about that from a timing standpoint. David Neithercut : I just have you and I\u2019ve already mentioned this Nick. Everything is always on the table. We consider these things and will be very thoughtful about what it is, what our options are to deal with the disconnect between the stock price and to NAV. But again as I served in response to some are the brighter questions, it's challenging with the gains that we had that we realized and having been pretty good capital allocators over the past dozen years to be able to really move the meter in a huge way. But there's no timing thing, it's just something that we we'll consider and we can be believes on the table all the time. Nick Yulico : Okay. Thanks, everyone. David Santee : You\u2019re welcome, Nick. Operator : And now we\u2019ll hear from Jeff Pehl with Goldman Sachs. Jeff Pehl : Hi, good morning. David Santee : Good morning. Jeff Pehl : Just a follow-up on a question on performance, how do you think A assets performing versus B assets, and are there any markets were B asset to outperforming is? David Santee : Well. I've always said its kind of location. I mean yes, we own A assets. We own B assets, the B assets and D, C are you doing the same as A assets. We don't see any difference. I mean if you look at our portfolio in San Francisco o or New York, you run the gamut of A's and B's and they are performing differently depending upon where are the new supply as on the demand for that product in the location that they sell. Jeff Pehl : Great, thanks. And just another quick one, can you provide an update on the amount of new move out to purchase a home? David Santee : Yes. It's really negligible. So bought homes move out to buy homes this year is actually year-to-date, is down 20 basis points, of that 12.1% of move out. Jeff Pehl : Great. Thanks for the color. David Santee : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Rob Stevenson with Janney. Go ahead please. Rob Stevenson : Good morning, guys. David Santee : Hi, Rob. Rob Stevenson : So you previously talked about the deliveries in Manhattan being Westside just heavy this year along with some of the other submarkets, but then when we got to 17, it was mostly Long Island City and Brooklyn. It sounded like today, you through the Westside in there again. Is that a change are seeing now when you are looking at those likely 17 deliveries? Are you seeing more in Manhattan especially on the Westside then you have been you would have seen three or six months ago. David Santee : I think what \u2013 well, first of all, we are now kind of combining the upper Westside with Midtown West when we talk about new supply. So Midtown West, and upper Westside are going to be delivering probably 2,400 units Next year, which relative to the overall supply is what 15%. I think the concern is that we do have some very large deliveries that occurred early in the year in the upper Westside, 1,100 unit property that is still only 50% leased. That\u2019s going to start running into renewals before they are least up. While at the same time adding a little more supply will kind of compound the rate challenges that we see in Midtown West and the upper Westside. But the upper Westside, specifically as a neighborhood is only expected to deliver 2,000 \u2013 I'm sorry 214 units into 17. Rob Stevenson : Okay. So it's really Midtown West that still going to see the supply within Manhattan in 17? David Santee : Yes. David Neithercut : As well as continued lease up in 17 and product delivered in 16. David Santee : Yes. Rob Stevenson : Okay. And then one for Mark, the difference \u2013 the $0.07 gap between the third quarter guidance between NAREIT FFO and core FFO or Normalized FFO, what is that? Mark Parrell : So I\u2019m sorry, you're talking about the difference in our guidance change or the difference between\u2026 Rob Stevenson : So you got 82 to 86 range for NAREIT FFO and is 75 to 79 for Normalized FFO. What is the difference between 82 to 75 and 86 to 79? Mark Parrell : So we have some land sale gains, but we really have their as Fort Lewis. And then the third quarter that $0.07 is going to be some land sale gains. Rob Stevenson : Okay. So Fort Lewis and land sale gains makes up that $0.07 differential? David Santee : I want to correct that. The $0.14 to the last two columns is Fort Lewis. To the right the $0.07 you referenced are the land sale gain. Rob Stevenson : Okay. So there's $0.07 of land sale gains in the third quarter? David Santee : That are projected. Sales haven\u2019t all occurred. They may not. But that\u2019s what we would expect based on what we have under contract now. Rob Stevenson : Okay, perfect. Thanks, guys. Operator : Now, we\u2019ll move to Tayo Okusanya. Please go ahead, with Jefferies. Tayo Okusanya : Yes. Hi, good morning. I'm just trying to reconcile the new guidance versus the old. The midpoint of guidance when it comes down $0.02, but just from the comments \u2013 kind of talk about the $0.06 loss from NOI and then the $0.01 gain from the delay in the asset sales. That's about $0.05 of downside. So I'm wondering why the midpoint of guidance really went down $0.02. Mark Parrell : Hey Tayo, it\u2019s Mark Parrell. Absolutely rightful question, the issue there is that we sort of started from a point that's higher than our midpoint. So when we talk back in February about our guidance we put out a wider, you might recall Normalized FFO range than usually a $0.20 range. We told we had more variability in our numbers because we had all of disposition activity and we didn't know when it would occur and obviously the later it occurred, the higher FFO would be in the earlier more we de-risk the special dividend. But we really didn't have all of that and certainty, we also did know when we would paying special. What debt we pay off. There's just a lot of moving pieces. So when we put our range together, and we spoke to you in February, we spoke to you in April, we saw on our range a way in which we could get modestly above the midpoint of our range and into the upper half of our old range. If we sold our assets relatively slowly. And so we gave ourselves a little flexibility. As our operating conditions deteriorated as we became more certain about what debt we are paying off, when we're going pay the specials and what assets are going to be sold, that what caused the whole thing to gravitate down. So the map is actually like $0.06 down on same-store, $0.01 up on transaction. But I\u2019m starting from a higher point in the 310 you are. Tayo Okusanya : Got it, okay. That makes sense. Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. David Santee : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Go ahead please. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning, there. Just I\u2019d some quick questions here. David Santee, you had mentioned New York that you expect supply to extend through 2018, just in general, looking across all your markets including San Francisco, when do you think \u2013 do you see the current supply wave continuing to be an issue through 2018? Or do think that maybe by mid-17, based on what you're seeing most of the market should have everything absorbed? David Santee : Well, for New York I guess its kind of a good news, bad news. I mean there is still not a 421 A program in place. So nothing is being really considered today. But we're looking at roughly 14,000 units [indiscernible] in New York for 2017, and I believe another 14,000 again in 2018. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And what about the other markets? You have San Francisco? What will be the other markets? David Santee : Yes, I mean San Francisco is going to deliver 7,000 units next year. Next year is going to be a very similar delivery cycle as we saw this year. Let's see \u2013 Washington, D.C., 10,000 this year, 9,000 in 2017; Seattle, 70 to 80 this year, about 7,000 next year; Los Angeles, 9,000 this year, 8,800 next year; Orange County, 3,900 this year, 5,400 next year; then San Diego, 1,600 this year, 2,700 next year. But I think it's important to note that as an example Orange County, a lot of the deliveries that are occurring this year are in North Orange, Anaheim, where we have no product versus last year all of the deliveries were centered in Irvine, where the bulk of our properties sit and we were greatly impacted. So we're seeing great results in Orange County as the result of the supply \u2013 the new deliveries being in a totally different submarket and far away from our existing portfolio. David Neithercut : But I'd say beyond that Alex our expectations as for deliveries to come down are being built to yields that we are seeing markets today are extremely low. And we certainly understand that the lending community is becoming much more conservative with respect to advance rates and who they\u2019re willing to sponsor. And I hear more and more \u2013 transaction team is seeing more and more inquiries about capital needs for developers who might have land tied up to complete the capital stack et cetera. So our expectation is just given to where our built to yields are today and what we understanding and we are seeing what\u2019s happening in the construction loan market are \u2013 we will expect the deliveries to come down from new 16% and 17% levels. Alexander Goldfarb : Right. But what you guys have just outlined, it just sounds like collectively we've got another sort of full year through end of 2017 to get through the supply before we\u2019ll get to the benefit of the tighter lending standards. Is that seems to be a\u2026 David Santee : Yes, I think that's right. But again as we look at what these unit counts are as a percentage of the additional stock, these are again not unquestionable levels. We believe our levels might put these markets for some period of time more in equilibrium after they have been [indiscernible] equilibrium over the past half a dozen years. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then for Mark Parrell, if we look at the sequential San Francisco revenue and rent growth, second quarter versus first quarter, there\u2019s still positive growth for San Francisco in its physical rental rate and in the revenue growth? Should we expect \u2013 based on the comments, should we expect these numbers to go negative in the back half of the year or just because how much you\u2019ve already locked in for the year, these numbers will actually still stay positive despite the commentary you discussed? Mark Parrell : I want to have the clarifying question. Do you mean quarter-over-quarter do we expect to have a negative NOI number in the third or fourth quarter? Or do you mean our sequential revenue numbers? Alexander Goldfarb : The sequential \u2013 on a linked quarter basis not a year-over-year basis. Mark Parrell : I think it will be slightly positive the whole way through. You probably would see it and it wouldn\u2019t be unexpected to see declines in the fourth quarter than the first just as you sort of see the normal seasonal pattern. But you're talking about this year. I guess at this point we don't see that. David Neithercut : None of us. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. So really next year we're going to see the bulk of this softness in next year's numbers? Mark Parrell : What is given the 2017 values, then yes, that\u2019s probably likely. Alexander Goldfarb : Awesome. Listen, thanks a lot guys. David Neithercut : You're welcome. Operator : We have John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. John Kim : Thank you. Given your portfolio quality you underweight affordable product in your portfolio, is that something that you think needs to be addressed? Not necessarily different market, but maybe different product or different submarket. Mark Parrell : Well, I think I\u2019m not sure, by affordably you just mean lesser Christ more workforces by pricing or you actually mean product that has requirements to meet certain income restriction or requirements of residents? I will tell you that we \u2013 as David Santee already said, we do operate in A product quality, we operate in B product quality across our portfolio and we do have various price points across every market and some market in which we operate. John Kim : Okay. And then David Neithercut, you mentioned the challenge of moving the needle with buybacks. But so far you\u2019ve done no credit from the market on your special dividend and your asset build a huge gain. Going forward on dispositions, would you consider joint issue asset sales, which may provide some more flexibility on proceeds? David Neithercut : That\u2019s certainly something we considered on the table as well. John Kim : Is there are difference in pricing on joint ventures versus complete asset sales. David Neithercut : Different in pricing? No, I think that, I think that there is sufficient price discovery in these markets that whether it\u2019s an outright sale or a joint venture type transaction, I think similar pricing can be achieved. John Kim : Great. Thank you. David Neithercut : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And [indiscernible] with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thanks for the time. I was just hoping you could clarify some comments you made about San Francisco concessions. Were you saying that there\u2019s no concessions on your existing product and relates only at the new sort of lease up developments and is that true outside of EQR. David Santee : I would say that I know there are some people that are giving modest concessions. But it\u2019s \u2013 they are not widespread. I mean, the \u2013 all of the new developments for the most part are giving kind of at a minimum one if not two months free on every lease. But we have \u2013 we have not seen widespread upfront move-in concessions across, you know, existing product in San Francisco. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Great. Thank you. And just a question on, on your redevelopment CapEx, kind of rehab work that you\u2019re doing, I think you\u2019re targeting $50 million. Is there any \u2013 I\u2019m not sure what returns you\u2019re targeting there, but is there any risk that you may not get the returns given the supply competition in the markets where that money is maybe being spent? And how should we think about that? Mark Parrell : For as our expectations in underwriting goes $11,000 or so per door that we put into kitchen and bath rehabs, we\u2019re getting solid double-digit returns. I mean our returns on that \u2013 in that expenditure. And should we fail to get that reasonable sort of spread in to an un-rehabed, we have the ability to stop the program. So we do monitor that closely. Consistently looking at the returns we\u2019re getting on rehab units and if for whatever reason at any time, if were not getting those premium we can stop that program on a dime. Unidentified Analyst : Is there a geographic skew to where that spend is going? Mark Parrell : No. I mean where doing it in any property and any market that we believe can get that sale appropriate mid-teen return. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Mark Parrell : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And next we hear from Ivy Zelman with Zelman and Associates. Ivy Zelman : Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. David Neithercut : Good morning. Ivy Zelman : With regard looking \u2013 good morning with the turnover if I\u2019m correct is a annualized turnover of 59.2 which was up about 280 basis points I guess versus our expectations for 150. So it was a little more than we had expected and recognizing turnover has been pretty low throughout the last few years. With respect to understanding the expenses, as turnover accelerates, how much are you factoring in our guidance for turn over to be sustained at current levels and how much variability does that have on NOI with respect to turnover accelerating more? And maybe you know maybe in the case it has been in the less several quarters or even last few years? David Neithercut : Well I guess I would say, a large portion of the increase in the physical turnover is a direct result of more people relocating in the same property for a variety of reasons. They either need more space, less space, lost a roommate \u2013 so in those cases, I mean, the frictional cost are you know, roughly $234 to clean, paint and shampoo an apartment. And you\u2019re not \u2013 you\u2019re not giving up any vacancy costs for that portion of your physical move out so to speak. So you know, like anything \u2013 the largest cost of turnover is vacancy. And when you net out the turnover, you know, it\u2019s not really that material. We have seen an elevated Ivy Zelman : No, I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s really helpful. I was trying to say on a go forward basis, so you\u2019re assuming sort of the same level of turnover, kind of holding where we are to extrapolate no real change in guidance on turnover. Or in your embedded assumptions for your guidance. David Neithercut : No. No change. Ivy Zelman : And then just secondly I think everyone has drilled a lot into San Francisco and New York city and you guys have done a great job in helping us understand the variability and respective volatility you have seen in the highest peak leasing fees. And I\u2019m kind of just thinking about looking at the ratio of you know, 2014 and 2015 urban multi-family permits as a percent of stock and Boston is screening the high second-highest after New York. And you obviously have exposure there as well Seattle and LA. Just thinking about how do you today extrapolate in, especially\u2019s Seattle you said is accelerating and recognizing that you are seeing improvement and really haven\u2019t seen same type of volatility in DC even if also screening not as badly as New York, let\u2019s say Boston. When you\u2019re giving us guidance, are you extrapolating the current trend like you had been in the guidance earlier in the year. And unfortunately so that volatility. Or are you being more conservative now because the supply hasn\u2019t become automatic or created volatility in the downside. You know have learned from that and you are saying we are going to more cautious even if those markets are extrapolating, we could extrapolate positively? David Santee : Yes. So, there\u2019s a lot of questions there. Ivy Zelman : Sorry. David Santee : Let me just use Boston as an example. So we know that, you know 2016 as an example we\u2019re delivering 2,300 units in Boston. The good news is, is that a lot of those units are now in the suburbs. And I think on our last call we said that we have, you know this 12 to 18 month window where, you know 2017 deliveries kind of moved back into the urban core, the Seaport, what have you \u2013 so that\u2019s why were seeing better revenue growth in Boston. You know, even though we delivered 5,000 units in 2015 in the urban core. We were still able to hold occupancy at 96%, new lease rents were flat. And we were still able to get renewal increases. And you know, that\u2019s kind of the \u2013 what we\u2019ve experienced, you know over the years is that, you know, even though these you know, the markets that were in today, you can still deliver product, hold the occupancy, but feel the rate pressure. And then when \u2013 the new deliveries move away from you, you start to get pricing power back. And I think, you know, that\u2019s \u2013 I think were just kind of in the middle or the beginning stages of getting to that \u2013 that point in San Francisco and New York. You know, but again, it\u2019s kind of the mix of jobs and where the deliveries are. So you mentioned Seattle, I mean Seattle is delivering \u2013I think they delivered 6,000 units \u2013 5,000 units last year. So we have to get deliveries in 2014, the occupancy continues to hold, we\u2019ve continued to be able to push rents. You know we expected in Seattle that we would see, pricing pressure in Belltown, central business district, Capitol Hill but now we\u2019re seeing, revenue actually accelerate in those markets as we begin to absorb. So it\u2019s just the combination of jobs, level of absorption, and the relative location of the new supply. Ivy Zelman : That\u2019s extremely helpful. I guess just to summarize if I may respectfully, so then with the current footprint with the exception of New York and San Francisco, you would argue that you are still optimistic with respect to the go forward deliveries and utilizing what you see today currently in the guidance you given us. You haven\u2019t cut those markets despite them being \u2013 may be much better even than you had been modeling. So you\u2019re utilizing the similar pattern to expect that those markets will continue to be where they are today. David Santee : No. Ivy Zelman : Okay, okay. David Santee : Look, right. And I think we\u2019ve said to previously, that you know, all these markets are generally on track. They are either you know, a tick below or a tick above. But there\u2019s nothing material in these other markets that would cause us to be you know overly optimistic or overly pessimistic. They are what they are. They are right on track and we\u2019ve kind of left them there for the rest of the year. Ivy Zelman : That\u2019s very helpful. If I could sneak in one more and again thank you so much for taking my question. The last one relates to just where cap rates are and I think David Neithercut you talked about the tightness of the transaction market despite the fundamentals that might be in the margin starting to moderate. If you think about where I guess directionally if you think cap rates are going to go, assuming rates are holding constant, do you expect the fundamental to start writing out, seeing more opportunities especially at the capital market, may not be or the banks are pulling back and being more stringent. What\u2019s your thought and outlook on cap rate? David Neithercut : Well it is not just cap rates, it is results and valuations too, right \u2013 ultimate valuations. I mean one of the things we done as we\u2019ve seen this new supply coming is to reduce our own construction upstarts. Well we are delivering a lot of product now but we\u2019ve got very little of anything kind of behind that. And it is very possible that we might see and I\u2019ll use the term loosely, opportunities to acquire assets in these markets. We think valuations are pretty solid. Depending on what happens to interest rates and global interest rates and demand for yield. We know where cap rates might go on extremely good quality, well located assets in the kind gateway cities that we\u2019re in. One reason we reduced our development business is because where we saw yields going and we saw new supply and we thought it may be a better deal for us to maybe buy completed assets rather than build our own just given the amount of supply that was coming. But it remains to be seen where cap rates certain and where values are headed. Ivy Zelman : Great, good luck, guys. Thank you. David Neithercut : Thanks very much Ivy. Operator : And now we\u2019ll hear from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Vincent Chao : Hey everyone. Just going back to San Francisco and New York for a second. We\u2019ve talked a lot about them obviously. But as far as the decline in the outlook for those two markets, we talked about rate after August not being as big a factor of occupancy and concession is bigger. But I guess San Francisco not seeing concession today. Are you building in any increase or is that just the assumption that concession levels will stay similar and that in New York same thing you are seeing concessions there. But are you projecting any change in the level of concessions over the back half. David Santee : We\u2019re not forecasting any concessions in the back half. I guess what I would say is that we, we\u2019ve accounted in San Francisco, we\u2019ve accounted for that with 100 basis point spread in occupancy. So if occupancy comes down far enough, then we would \u2013 or if we see occupancy going in the wrong direction, we would use concessions to boost occupancy up. And that higher occupancy kind of would offset any concessions that we would \u2013 that we would need to offer. But we\u2019ve really just factored the net effective new lease pricing for the balance of the year in San Francisco. Vincent Chao : Okay. And then net effect will be similar to what you are seeing in July and August I guess? David Santee : If not a little lower. Vincent Chao : Okay, thanks. David Santee : You are welcome. Operator : And now we\u2019ll take a question from Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities. Tom Lesnick : Thanks for taking my questions. First on development and peers like you guys moved up to stabilization dates on a lot of your developments this and 99 in particular over the last quarter. Is that due to the concessions you are offering right now. It feels kind of counterintuitive to the narrative that the Bay Area development leasing is slowing? David Santee : Actually we said nothing close to lease up in development long. Our absorption and our transactions in San Francisco have exceeded our expectations and we have significantly moved up the stabilization [indiscernible] because our absorption there was almost doubled what our real expectations were. And we were looking at 20 or so a month and we have been doing almost 26 a month. No one thought that would necessarily continue which is why it took us so long to change that stabilization date. But were moving right along there and I\u2019ll tell you that we been doing that with concessions of two weeks to one month. And again at rent stand above our pro forma expectations but maybe modestly below what we might have hope we would do at the beginning of this year. So the absorption of our San Francisco transactions have been strong and the lease rates have \u2013 exceeded our regional expectations and so the deals were stabilized at yields ahead of what we had originally underwritten. Tom Lesnick : Okay. Thanks for that insight. And then getting away from New York and San Francisco for a moment. Let me\u2026 David Santee : Thank you. Tom Lesnick : Feel like right now is the right time for 100 K Street. There has been a lot of development in there lately what do you feel like right now is the time to strike? David Santee : Well because we\u2019re delivering 18 and stabilize in 19. And we\u2019re seeing improvements in the market. That product has been absorbed. David talked about it maybe modestly performing better above we had hoped. And we think, you know, who knows what 18 and 19 will bring? But we think there\u2019s not a lot starting now and that will be a fine time in that marketplace to deliver new product. Tom Lesnick : All right. Thanks, guys. David Santee : And again at $88 million deposits not going to either one way or the other Tom. Tom Lesnick : Makes sense. Thanks again. David Santee : You bet. Operator : Now we\u2019ll hear from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Market. Wes Golladay : Good morning, guys. When we talk about Northern California what do you see in the various submarket there. I imagine, Berkeley, Michigan Bay are probably the hardest hit. Give your high level do you have ever work in the region, anything hanging in there? David Santee : Yes. So I\u2019ll just kind of go major submarket in San Francisco. And talk about kind of where rents are today relative to same week last year. We have Berkeley, which is more student driven, it was only down 0.5%. Obviously San Francisco, proper is down 5.4%, which is actually bolstered by one property when you look at Geary Courtyard, SoMa, those are kind of ground zero where the new deliveries are. Those are down 11.5%, 8% on rents. East Bay is still flat. East Bay continues to hold up relatively well. The Peninsula, we have some new deliveries there that are more attractive to Millennials. Those rents are down about 5% and then South Bay, which is really put a lot of new deliveries behind it, is down 2%. Wes Golladay : Okay, and thanks a lot for that, excellent color. And then looking at the fast leasing pace for your San Francisco development, how does that \u2013 you mentioned [indiscernible]. Are just pulling from other communities based on what you\u2019re seeing from the application of new renters? David Santee : Yes, I think \u2013 what David had commented earlier, we\u2019ve got the ability people to sort of move from older products \u2013 the first wave of new supply that\u2019s been delivered in San Francisco in years. And people have the ability to move across into newer product, that you know if not modestly more around the same they were paying for lesser quality products. So we just sort of seeing \u2013 our tenant base have had more options than we been seeing them move to our properties from elsewhere in the area. Wes Golladay : Okay and would you characterize that as coming from maybe the other cities or the East Bay or is it mainly within the 3 mile to 5 mile radius where you\u2019re getting most of the movements from? David Santee : Do know the answer to that question David? We\u2019d certainly would have that but in the system but we don\u2019t have that at our fingertips. Wes Golladay : Okay. I\u2019ll follow-up with you. Thanks a lot for taking the question. David Santee : Thanks, thank you. Operator : And now we\u2019ll take some follow-up questions. One from David Bragg, Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. David Bragg : Thanks again. Just to review your market level, revenue growth expectations. It would be helpful to hear about the other markets. I think you said you\u2019re currently expecting 6.5% same-store revenue growth from San Francisco, 1.5% in New York. I assume that these figures underpin the midpoint of your revenue growth guidance and if that\u2019s correct if you could just run through the other markets. David Santee : Yes. Boston 2.8%, New York, we said 1.5%, Washington D.C 1.2%, Seattle 6.1%, Orange County 5.8%, San Diego 5.7%. David Bragg : Thank you, for that. And then next, in the second quarter for the entire portfolio, what were the gains on renewals and what were the gains on new move-ins, ideally lease-over-lease? David Santee : Okay, lease-over-lease renewal pricing for Q2 was 5.9%. Lease-over-lease on new move-ins was 1.5% and then combined, was 3.7%. David Bragg : Okay. And then can you tell us what you\u2019re expecting for the portfolio on those two metrics for 3Q and 4Q? David Santee : Yes, I would have to give you ranges. But you know I see renewals moderating down to call it, four to five. And then new lease \u2013 new move-ins, I mean obviously new move-ins, because of the seasonality they just automatically compress. So as an example, Q1 of 2015, we did 40 basis points. So I would imagine in Q4 of 2015, we did minus 40 basis points. So it\u2019s just the natural cycle, I would expect them to fall off the balance of the year. To what degree is really just a function of, again going back to that who moved, which resident moves out and at what property. David Bragg : Okay so no specific range on new move-ins. But the renewals is 4% to 5% range and that compares to what looks like about 6.5% on renewals in the second half of last year? Is that correct? David Santee : Renewals, yes, 15 renewals were 6.8% and Q4 renewals were 6.4%. David Bragg : Okay. One last one for you David Santee, on this topic, you\u2019ve experienced a dramatic widening in the spread between new move-ins and renewals in San Francisco, how long can that persist, especially in this day and age when there\u2019s such great visibility on where new units are being priced in the market? David Santee : Let me answer your question this way. San Francisco, in July, we achieved an 8%. We are issuing new renewals kind of in the October range at a 5.8%. So we issued in July 11.1%. In October we are issuing a 5.8% if that kind of gives you what you need. David Neithercut : And we achieved 9% in the first half of the year. David Santee : Right, right. David Bragg : Okay. So the renewal gains are declining or decelerating in [indiscernible] more or less with new move-ins. The spread is remaining somewhat the same sounds like. David Santee : Well I guess what I would say is that, obviously, we are at a juncture where we need to, it\u2019s in our best interest to retain every resident possible. Because we have a 40% chance that we could take a 15% drop on the new rent, every time one of those residents move out. So we\u2019re consciously being conservative on our issuance of renewal increases from this point forward. So hopefully, I mean the spread has gone from the typical 180 up to 350, 400 basis points. Hopefully, as we issue more market friendly renewal increases, that the spreads will compress back down to 180 if not lower. David Bragg : All right, thank you again. David Santee : You bet Dave. Operator : And Nick Joseph, Citigroup. Go ahead, please. Nick Joseph : Thanks, one last quick one. Given your experience this year and the more uncertain operating environment that we\u2019ve been talking about, are you planning on providing preliminary 2017 same-store revenue growth guidance with Q3 results? David Santee : Well, we haven\u2019t made any decision about that, Nick. My guess is the experience we\u2019ve had this past year, I\u2019m sure most people here would not like to do that. Just given the volatility. If we feel like we could give a number that we believe is valid and helpful, we\u2019ll certainly consider it. But I think with this, given the level of volatility we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re not sure that would be in anyone\u2019s best interest at the present time but no decision has been made. Nick Joseph : Thanks. Operator : And now we\u2019ll take the question from Richard Hill, Morgan Stanley. And Mr. Hill your line is open please un-mute it if you have muted. I\u2019m hearing no response from that line. I will turn the call back over to your host for any closing or additional remarks. David Neithercut : Thank you. Thank you all for your time today. I hope you all have great remaining part of the summer and we look forward to seeing many of you in September. Operator : And with that, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your call for today. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. I'll now turn it over to David Neithercut. David Neithercut : Thanks Marty. Good morning everyone, thank you for joining us this morning's call. As we discussed over the last several quarters, 2016 will not turn out to be a year we had originally expected due to elevated levels of new supply in both San Francisco and New York City which combined made up a large share of our initial growth forecast for the year. And as a result after five years of extraordinary strong fundamentals, revenue growth this year will now be more in line with long-term historical trends. Good news however is that exceptionally strong demand continues unabated across our markets with current occupancies remaining at or near 96% and lower exposure on the horizon. Turnover across all markets when excluding same property movement is actually decreased for the first nine months of the year compared to the same period last year. Move outs to buy single-family homes remain a non-factor in our high cost of housing markets and our recently completed development properties are absorbing units to significantly faster and at rates above or closer to our original expectations. Furthermore while our markets have experienced the slowdown in the growth of high income jobs, the absolute number of new high income jobs remains relatively strong and our preliminary indications that the trend may be reversing. Perhaps more importantly for the first time since recovery began there are abundant times and wage growth occurring in all the industries across the country which obviously the very good signs of the apartment business. So as we look forward to what we see as peak deliveries next year, our teams across the country will work very hard in carrying for our existing residence, welcoming prospects and trying them into new residence and we remain extraordinarily excited about the outlook for our business, portfolio and the company. So with that said, we\u2019ll let David Santee go into more details on what we\u2019re seeing across our markets today. David Santee : Okay, thank you David. Good morning everyone. Today I'll update you our Q3 results, discuss the current state of each market which we operate as well as providing additional color on 2017 deliveries. As David said, demand for quality apartments remain pretty robust with occupancies and our markets averaging 96 or better and resident turnover continuing to decline. Year-to-date turnover net of same property transfers decreased 30 basis points versus the 10 basis point increase and the gross turnover that we reported demonstrated the strong customer satisfaction that are fully strived to deliver each and every day and the great locations our portfolio continues to enjoy. Renewal rates achieved for the quarter continued to be well above historical averages at 5.3% while new lease over least pricing was plus 90 basis points. Combined results were in line with our revised expectations at 3.1%. Moving on to the market, in Seattle new lease over lease growth average 4.9% for the quarter while renewals achieved were 8.1%. Seattle continues to distinguish itself as the epicenter of cloud computing services as Amazon remains the catalyst with the rapid downtown expansion of both jobs and new apartment deliveries. Through August Seattle, Bellevue and Redmond realize job growth of 3.50% that allows 7,200 apartment deliveries this year to be easily absorbed with virtually zero pricing pressure. Now with 7,000 new deliveries expected in '17 and job growth well above the national average, we see Seattle is our best revenue growth market next year. Again easy job, Amazon job openings is a proxy for demand. Last week there were 8,000 openings in Seattle almost double from same time last year, 3300 of which are for high paying software developer positions. This concentration of intellectual capital is also forcing the large well established tech companies to expand their presence in Seattle to better compete for talent. Microsoft, the region's second largest employer, recently committed to a significant investment in a new artificial intelligent's group and most recently announced record operating results. With cloud computing in early innings and Boeing the areas of largest employer having a seven year backlog in airplane production, Seattle is poised for continued growth as rents are the lowest of all the markets in which we operate likely delivering strong revenue results that are slightly lower next year. Then the San Francisco, while operations were quite volatile during the summer peak leasing season, where recently the market has been more stable across the key drivers of revenue growth. Occupancy has improved to 96% versus the low 95% that we saw only a few months ago. The percent of residents renewing are at peak levels and contrary to some reports of rents being down double digits, our San Francisco portfolio average asking rents are down only 1.4% versus same week last year. Growth in higher paying tech jobs as not as robust as 2015 but the growth is nonetheless positive and while VC capital investment has slowed, the actual amount of VC funds available for investment have increased. All the fundamentals are still in place for the market to absorb 2017 deliveries. However elevated supply and a slower pace of VC investment that drives the tech segment will continue to have a negative impact on pricing power in sub markets that see the most deliveries. Achieved renewal rates for the quarter in San Francisco were 6.2%, new lease over lease rate averaged minus 30 basis points. The modest increase and turnover is more than accounted for about same property transfers. Netting this out year-to-date turnover has actually declined 70 basis points on top of the improvement we saw last year. 2017 we\u2019ll see the market deliver 8400 new apartments with deliveries that are less concentrated then in 2016. In the downtown areas some will see 50% fewer units delivered with the balance spread across Mission Bay and the Dogpatch areas. The mid Peninsula will also be more disbursed with only 1600 units spread across all directions of San Mateo and Redwood City. San Jose and Santa Clara will see the majority of deliveries in South Bay and with the less geographically competitive with our same store portfolio. Based on current delivery estimates, the 2017 supply appears to be more frontloaded in the year which means most of the supply will begin leasing up and periods of peak demand. San Francisco remains ground zero for innovation and tech stalwarts continue to expand their footprint. As artificial intelligent and the Internet-of-Things continues to grow less, we expect San Francisco continued to lead the world in tech and overcome any short term challenges with supply. Time and time again San Francisco has proven to come back faster and stronger than peak to the past but we would expect San Fran to deliver revenue growth in 2017 that is much lower than 2016. Dropping down to LA, job growth continues to be very strong but is dominated more by lower paying hospitality and leisure sector. However, as downtown LA focuses on its Renaissance efforts and Silicon Beach continues to develop and build out the higher paying professional services sector is expected to lead job growth through 2020. As non-traditional entertainment content continues to grow, Southern California is poised to capture this additional investment as well. Demand for apartments continues to be strong with occupancy across our LA portfolio at 96.3%. Renewal rates achieved for the quarter were 6.8% and new lease over lease growth was 2.5% on lower turnover for the quarter. Based on current estimates, LA will see peak deliveries of 10,000 units during 2017 with over 80% of these units spread across three sub markets. Downtown Hollywood will represent 50% of the 80%, Glendale-Pasadena, 20% of the 80% and then Koreatown mid-Wilshire at 14% of the 80%. To-date deliveries in the urban core and west LA have had modest impact on revenue growth which today is in the 3% to 5% range. As LA continues to add sully the urban core, downtown continues to be more attractive lifestyle that has been non-existed for many years. With virtually no units been delivered this year or next, the East and West San Fernando Valley, Ventura County and Inland Empire continue to show signs of accelerated revenue growth upwards up 6% to 7% for the current month billings. For 2017 we would expect greater LA counting to deliver modest renewable revenue growth, pressured by the level of new supply in the urban core. Orange County at 96% occupancy today achieved renewals for the quarter of 7.6% and that was the strongest across our portfolio and new lease - over lease growth of 4.4%. After taking a breather from elevated deliveries in 2015 and for the most part 2016, Orange County is expected to deliver 5700 units in 2017 and about 50% concentration in Irvine, Newport Beach sub market and the balance spread from Anaheim up through Huntington Beach. With almost 65% of our portfolio in South Orange County, we would expect slightly lower revenue growth as a result of the concentration of deliveries at urban where we have 35% of our revenues. San Diego was extremely strong job growth in the first half of the year has seen strong demand for apartments with very little supply. San Diego is distinguishing itself as the life science medical device tech manufacturing center and continues to have high paying jobs in these sectors albeit at a slower rate. Second, only the Orange County achieved renewal rate growth for the quarter averaged 7.4% with new lease over lease growth of 4.4%, again on lower turnover. San Diego will deliver 2300 units in 2017 which appear to be disbursed equally between downtown and the I15 corridor on lower expected job growth. The I-15 sub market is already showing modest deceleration and we would expect revenue results in '17 to be somewhat lower next year. Jumping over to Boston, as we previously said 2016 would be a window of opportunity in the urban core and especially Cambridge where deliveries were few. Today that has played out where we have seen modest deceleration and revenue growth with more pressure on rents in the suburbs than downtown. New lease over lease growth of 1.6% for Q3 was the strongest quarter since Q3 of '15. Achieved renewal rate growth was 4.9% and again on lower turnover. As Boston continues to position itself as a major tech, biotech hub and an endorsement with the GE headquarter relocation, the future of Boston and professional services job growth is very bright as professional services sectors moves from 35% of jobs created to 45% of new jobs created this year. In the near term Boston is expected to deliver approximately 6200 units in 2017 split evenly between Downtown Cambridge and then North and West Suburbs. Given the concentrations of the new supply to our portfolio, we see continued deceleration across the market and expect revenue growth to be lower than 2016. New York for the quarter achieved an average renewal rates of 3% and minus 2% on new lease, over lease growth, again on slightly lower turnover. With the trend toward affordability over neighborhood loyalty, prospective renters are proving to be more flexible in where they choose to live. To-date 55% of the 2016 deliveries have been absorbed. Concessions have yet to become widespread and appear to be more targeted to specific unit types at stabilized communities. The Upper West Side and West Side down to Chelsea are currently the weakest neighborhoods in our portfolio and are delivering slightly negative revenue growth for the current month. The New York MSA will see 14,000 units in 2017 and to clarify these are units that are identified and so very considerably to be within the competitive boundaries decline by our portfolio. It will not match the higher MSA numbers provided by third party data shops. It should be no surprise that Brooklyn will deliver the lion\u2019s share of new units where we have less than 8% of total New York Metro revenue, followed by a Long Island City, where we have no presence, Midtown West will deliver a good portion as Hudson Yard comes online and then the Hudson Waterfront, specifically Jersey City. These four submarkets were account for a little more than 70% of all deliveries with a balance spread across various Manhattan neighborhoods. While there has been lingering pressures on the financial services sector, high paying tech jobs and venture capital continued to migrate to the area. Some believe that Brexit could bring back additional financial services jobs and that would be a good thing. While supply pressures are driven largely by the expiration of the 421a program, the lack of any existing replacement legislation will create a scenario and the near future of significantly reduced supply. With expectations of more affordability in any future legislation and increasing concession cost is hard to imagine deliveries that come close to historical norms. Given all these factors and the deceleration we see today, we see New York as our worst performing market with the high probability of revenue growth turning negative during the year. Last but not least the, DC, the metro area continues to improve, coming off of best job growth since 2008 out of our 10 submarkets are currently delivering accelerated revenue growth where our current month of growth exceeds year-to-date growth anywhere from the 100 to 300 basis points. For the quarter renewal rates achieved were 4.6%, the strongest in the last seven quarters and new lease over lease growth was plus 20 basis points again the strongest in seven quarters with flat occupancy and turnover. With expectations of future job growth being very favorable and over half of the 10,000 units being delivered concentrated in the Southeast and Southwest submarkets we would expect continued favorable absorption and accelerating revenue growth in the submarkets and which we operate. Like LA and living in Downtown DC, 10 years ago was not a consideration for most as more apartments come online, more restaurants and activities are creating an urban environment that did not exist previously, brining in suburban renters who find downtown more attractive and active lifestyle, given the traffic congestion and commuting costs that currently exist in the region. We expect the acceleration revenue growth that we see today to continue into next year. And in closing 2017 revenue growth were certainly be lower than 2016. Job growth and job sectors will just take the ability of each marker to absorb these levels of elevated supply. The degree of management sophistication and discipline will determine how we price it and overall impact to revenue growth. With occupancies still in the 96% range, demand remains strong, but elevated supplies that are not supported by the necessary job growth will face varying degrees of pricing pressure in the near-term. So with that said, I will turn it over to Mark Parrell. Mark? Mark Parrell : Thank you, David. Today, I will be giving some color behind our same-store expense growth in the quarter and on normalized FFO guidance and I\u2019m going to move on to talk a bit about our recent debt deal. On the same-store expense side, we moved our annual same-store expense range to 2.8% to 3.2%, which moved the center of our range back to the mid-point of our original February guidance range and to the high-end of our July guidance range of 2.5% to 3%. This is the relatively modest change for us, 25 basis points in annual expense growth is about $1.5 million. Our same-store expenses through June 30 grew at a rate of only 0.9%, therefore as we mentioned on the second quarter call, we always expected our second half expenses to grow at a considerably higher rate somewhere in the mid 4% range in order to meet our July guidance range of 2.5% to 3%. In a moment I will give some detail on payroll expense and on leasing and advertising expense which were the two main drivers of our change in expense guidance. But first I want to mention one of the bigger drivers of our overall same-store expense growth this year and that\u2019s the recent adverse legal decision regarding the calculation of property taxes for several of our properties in Jersey City that I noted on our second quarter call. The same-store impact of this decision was an increase of 2016 annual real estate tax expense of $1.6 million. We were aware of this and maintaining our same-store expense range of 2.5% to 3% back in July, but still thought that we could stay within that range. So overall for 2016, we expect property tax expense to grow by 6%. So getting back to the change in same-store expense guidance on the payroll side, cost in the third quarter were about $1 million more than we had originally planned because we ran our properties in the third quarter at higher employment levels to keep our properties competitive in some of these challenging markets. We also made aggressive efforts to retain our field personnel in the face of the great demand for them in our markets as new supply gets delivered and needs to be staffed up. In the leasing and advertising lines, we incurred promotional expenses at the high-end of our expectations mostly in New York and San Francisco in response to higher supply in these markets. This heightened spending of about $1 million included about $670,000 in gift cards given to new residents and payment of broker commissions on a few high rent units. We did anticipate some gift card usage in the third quarter, but the order of magnitude is higher than we expected back in July. We also spend a bit more on internet listing services in the quarter. Please do remember that higher occupancy in 2015 and we are able to reduce such spending in the comparable quarter. We expect additional promotional spending to continue in the fourth quarter though at a lesser pace. So just an accounting note, those rules, the accounting rules require that we account for gift card spending as an expense. However, if we have accounting for the cards is a reduction in revenue, the impact of the Company\u2019s results would have been a reduction in quarterly same-store revenue of 12 basis points which would have reduced our reported 3.4% quarterly same-store revenue growth number to 3.3%. The impact on our full year same-store revenue as a result of the gift cards we gave in the third quarter the ones I just discussed and that we expect to give in the fourth quarter will be even less about 5 basis points if they were to be treated as a contra to revenue. So now I\u2019m going to switch over and talk about move-in concessions on our same-store portfolio and those we do treat as reductions in revenue, so again on the same-store portfolio in the third quarter we gave approximately $190,000 versus in these concessions versus the $235,000 in move-in concessions we gave in the third quarter of 2015. In terms of the sensitivity of our revised guidance range or expense range, leasing and advertising and payroll are the two likely pressure points that can move our annual expenses for the higher end of our new range of 2.8% to 3.2%. On the leasing and advertising side, we expect less gift card spending for the rest of the year because of the lower turnover we expect in the fourth quarter and our strong current occupancy. If we are incorrect in these assumptions, our expense growth could be pressured. Another possible pressure point is the payroll cost continues to escalate due to wage pressure or service levels required by heightened competition in our markets. On the revenue side, we have left our mid-point of 3.75% unchanged and David Santee has already provided you bit of color on that.  We just fine-tuned a few other guidance numbers, so we will just talk about that for a minute and we continue to see normalized FFOs remain within our prior range that we narrow that range as we customarily do at this time of year. Our current annual normalized FFO midpoint of $3.08 per share is nearly identical to the $3.10 per share midpoint of the range we originally gave you back in February as reductions in same-store NOI were offset by changes in transaction timing and amounts. Now just a note on our debt deal. On October 12, we closed on a $500 million 10-year unsecured note offering with a coupon of 2.85% and an all in effective rate of approximately 3.1% which includes underwriter's fees and the termination of a small interest rate hedge we had. There is great demand for this debt and we printed the lowest tenure in our history and one of the lowest ever by a REIT and we thank our unsecured bond investors for their support of the company. Proceeds from this issuance was used to for working capital and general corporate purposes. Our projected combined line of credit and commercial papers amount outstanding for those two combined at December 31, 2016 is now anticipated to be 130 million versus the 430 million we previously estimated back in July and that's due to proceeds from the $500 million debt deal, reducing line usage and that\u2019s offset by a net $100 million reduction in disposition proceeds that we now expect in 2016. So I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Cynthia for the question and answer period. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Nick Yulico from UBS. Nick Yulico : Thanks everyone. I think the primary worry for your company and some of the other multi-family REITs remains New York City and San Francisco and how bad these markets can get in 2017. You gave some commentary on it, but I was hoping to get some more parameters on how you're thinking about the downside for same-store revenue or rent growth in these two markets next year. Mark Parrell : I believe we probably said and we intend to say at this junction Nick and we'll save more in detail, more color than we actually given, more complete guidance on our next quarter conference call. I think David was pretty clear about directionally what was happening in the supply and what have been happening in jobs et cetera and so what our expectations would directionally but we won\u2019t go any further than that at this time. Nick Yulico : Okay. And then could you just remind us for those markets what the assumptions are for fourth quarter, this year same-store revenue growth? Mark Parrell : I'm sorry. Do you mean the overall or by market? Nick Yulico : For San Francisco and New York separately what were the assumptions for fourth quarter this year? Mark Parrell : I am going to talk just for a second about the overall assumption. So our guidance is wise about a 3% fourth quarter same-store revenue number, about a 4.5% or so same-store expense number in the fourth quarter. I am not sure if we have market-by-market numbers right here in front of us and we don\u2019t. Nick Yulico : Okay. And then just going back to, David, if we think about multi-family valuations in the private market, do you think cap rates have changed in the past year for your core markets, particularly in New York or San Francisco, if rent growth has come down? Do you think, if you were to sell assets in those markets today versus a year ago, has the pricing changed? David Neithercut : I think it's tough to tell, Nick, I am not sure if there has been sufficient price discovery but if there has been some modest change in cap rates I am not sure that it\u2019s had a big impact on value. We've had even San Francisco we'll still have strong decent NOI growth on a year-over-year basis so any modest change in cap rates they don\u2019t necessarily mean value so they have decreased. We've certainly seen fewer players in the marketplace looking for assets but I will tell you, not a week goes by when Alan George is not showing me some deal that traded at some very strong price across these markets. So we're watching it closely. Certainly revenues not growing at the same rate, bottom lines are not growing at the same rate that they had but bottom lines by large they'll continue to improve, continue to grow. There continues to be a need or demand for yield, and so when you do trade they continue to trade fairly strong pricing. Nick Yulico : Okay. So given that's the case, that valuation seems to be holding up in the private market and your stock is at a big discount to NAV, what point do you think about, does the Board think about, selling more assets, doing a stock buyback to exploit that arbitrage in pricing? And also, did the asset sales year-to-date and the special dividend delay any sort of process you might have had to sell assets this year and do a buyback to force that discussion until 2017? Thanks. David Neithercut : In response to the answer of your second question, no, I can tell you that very specifically as the Board table as we talked about large portfolio sale and the special dividend, distribution back to shareholders, we spoke very specifically with the Board that, that did not - would not impact any other things that the steps we might take to address the discount that you know. So those things are not - we're not precluded by having done what we did do. In terms of when does the Board do that, there is no bright line, every situation will be different but I can tell you I guess I have on this most recent call and the call even before that, that we talk about that at the Board level. And the Board just believes that that activity we requires probably a bigger discount than what many on the street might suggest there what answers they get with their arithmetic. We got a significant amount of gain built into most of our assets and that there is just not a lot of capacity after - we are doing things on debt neutral basis and distributing - dealing with the gains actually buy much stock back with the proceeds. And then with respect to borrowing to buy stock back that these are - you get relatively few bites of the apple and we want to make sure that if and when we do, there will be appropriate time. And we'll continue to monitor this as we do on a regular and consistent basis with the Board and we'll \u2013 makes sense to do something down the road, we are certainly - we would be willing to do that. We've done in the past and we certainly will do so in the future if the circumstances are large and we talked about it with the Board all the time but in terms of when exactly what's the bright line I can't tell you that's we'll know when we see it. Nick Yulico : All right. Thanks, David. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi. Nick Joseph : Thanks. Giving the operating environment is at inflection point, how do you think about setting the 2017 same-store revenue growth guidance range? Historically, you've had a pretty tight range of 75 to 100 basis points for that initial range. So how wide could that be in 2017? David Neithercut : Well, I guess I won't say how wide it could be, but I'll tell you it will likely be lighter to your point. We acknowledged that by now operating in fewer markets. There is risk of more volatility in those - in our results and that we will likely provide wider guidance and what we have been able to do in the past. In terms of how wide that will be, will be same and you will certainly see when we share those results with you with that guidance on our next earnings call. Nick Joseph : Thanks. And then just appreciate the details on the concessions and the gift cards. But from an operating standpoint, how do you think about incentivizing with free rent versus using gift cards or other basic incentives? David Santee : Nick, this is David Santee. As we've always said even in the last downturn, we were very committed to our net effective price again that is our preferred method of pricing because it provides complete transparency, it's easier to manage from here. So that will always be our tried and true method. Occasionally, you get into some submarkets or different owners that do different things that cater to certain niches in our prospect base, and we try to stick to our guns as far as net effective pricing, but at times we find it we have to kind of match the market. And I think that's been our philosophy for the last seven or eight years and that will be our philosophy going forward. Nick Yulico : Thanks. And just finally on supply, I appreciate the detailed walk through by market. But if you step back and think about all of your markets blended together, what are your expectations for next year\u2019s supply deliveries of the urban versus suburban sub markets? I think we heard from one of your peers yesterday that they think there will be two times the amount of supply in urban submarkets as suburban? David Neithercut : Well, I guess I would say that we just \u2013 we don\u2019t necessarily look at it urban, suburban. We look at it as what set of properties are in a reasonable and conservative geographic area that could potentially compete with us and probably New York is a great example of where we have nothing in Long Island City. There will be a lot of new supply in Long Island City and the price point maybe very attractive that could draw people from Brooklyn or Manhattan or what have you and the Long Island City just because of an affordability issue. So I mean all in numbers for 2017 are 65,000 units. I would say a very high percentage of those are in the urban core. Q \u2013 Nick Yulico : Thanks. Operator : And we will take our next question from Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Rich Hightower : Hi, good morning, guys. I want to go back to one of the prepared comments related to San Francisco, I think when David Santee was giving the market detail there. I thought I picked up on some comments around a potential stabilization there. Is that accurate, just in terms of how new and renewals are trading today, or is that just a function of lower turnover at this point in the leasing season, or a shift in timing of supply, or some other factor? David Santee : Well, I guess I would say stable relative to what we experienced over the past four or five months. I would say certainly not \u2013 the market is not moving back up, it\u2019s kind of moving sideways right now. But we started off with going from rent that were up 5%, 6% that within a couple of months went down to negative 2%. We saw occupancies that were well above 96% fall off over a 100 basis points in the peak leasing season, which is not a time that you would expect lower demand. So the market just zigging and zagging for most of the summer, and so today our exposure is right back where it was, our occupancies for the most part right on top of last year. We don\u2019t see any crazy pricing mechanisms in the market, I mean the newbies up will continue to offer the one, one and a half months free rent and we expect that. But for the most part, I would really just say the market appears to be more disciplined today, instead of stable, it\u2019s just more disciplined today than it has been over the last four months. Rich Hightower : All right, would you say then that properties that are in lease up currently, the market overall is just getting a little more rational, in that sense? So it would indeed be a positive change that we could sort of extrapolate from here or anything else? David Santee : Yes, I mean you had a very large concentration of assets in the SoMa area, which really trickled across, as well as South San Francisco and I go back to the kind of original underwriting where the market rent growth in San Francisco are out paced underwriting or new assets. I mean even looking at our own assets the market went well above what we underwrote on our new delivery. So owners had a lot of wiggle room to price discover. There hasn\u2019t really been any high rise brand new vertical class, great views with the way assets delivered in San Francisco for years. So there was some element of price discovery and I feel like some could have probably achieved higher rents when you look at the pace of lease up. So I think you'll see, obviously you'll see less of that type of product. In 2017 probably more podium, traditional development that you see down in San Jose what have you and pricing should - we expect and hope that it would be more reasonable than what we saw last year or this year. Rich Hightower : All right. That's actually very helpful color. Second, and final question, it's another twist on the 2017 question. But would you guys be able to rank order your markets next year, just in terms of top to bottom, strongest versus weakest? David Neithercut : Okay. At Seattle we would expect it would be the best. I think Southern \u2013 all three of the Southern California markets would probably be in the middle. Boston would probably be below that and there would be a wide range between SoCal and Boston. Well, actually we want to put D.C. before Boston, I'm sorry. So D.C. would be between SoCal and Boston. D.C. continues to improve, great acceleration, great job growth. Boston will be at the bottom and probably only slightly above our worst market New York. Rich Hightower : Great. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Conor Wagner with Green Street Advisors. Conor Wagner : Good morning. I noticed that you guys are offering some 24-month leases in New York and in the Bay area. What was the uptake on that? And is that something that you're going to continue to offer going into 2017? Mark Parrell : So we've tried in different ways we had a better take rate with no step up we've tried it with built in step ups. I think our customer is well educated enough to know what's going on in the market. So when we built in the step up meaning you know call it 2% or 3% increase in year two, our take rate bill to basically zero. So you know we did that in D.C. When we expected rates to fall in D.C. we had probably in the neighborhood of 15% take rate. That's what we're seeing today is about 15% take rate and we will continue to you know experiment with that, but monitoring so that we don't you know get to committed. Conor Wagner : And in the Bay Area how is the performance of your East Bay assets versus the overall Bay area versus San Francisco. Mark Parrell : The East Bay is you know obviously the best I thing you know when we just look at you know were we flip today I mean obviously you know we were if not - if not the accelerating as such as example year-to-date East Bay is 7.5% on revenue growth the current month, buildings are 5%. So the East Bay still hanging I mean obviously Berkeley is helping that as well. Conor Wagner : And then a question for David Neithercut. You mentioned the challenges of doing a stock buyback due to the gains. What do you view as your most attractive use of capital going into 2017? David Neithercut : All right now complaining our developments we've made a significant amount of money we will make a significant amount of money on the developments and we've got yet to complete and much of the free cash flow that we have for the next couple of years we\u2019ll complete that and we make significant returns. In fact we\u2019ve got a page in the most recent investor information we put up on our website. It sort of shows how we\u2019ve done throughout the cycle. And then after that we\u2019ve not started much development at all so that the development spend will slow. We continue to do very well with our redevelopment, with our kind of kitchen and bath rehab spend that\u2019s been up 50 plus or so million dollar of spend per year which we\u2019ve been realizing very strong low-to-mid double-digit returns for the foreseeable future and we look at those as great uses of capital. Connor Wagner : And then as kitchen and bath spend has been elevated this year versus last year, have there been any markets that you've been particularly focused in with that, or has it been broad-based? David Neithercut : It\u2019s been rather broad based. Connor Wagner : Okay. And do you have an estimate on what contribution that's been to revenue growth this year? Mark Parrell : Year-to-date Connor its Mark Parrell. It\u2019s 10 basis points and remember it varies around that. It can be zero to 20. It doesn\u2019t move the meter that considerably. David Santee : Just to be clear, when we talk about this program because others talk about programs that they call rehab or whatever. We\u2019re spending depending on the property $10,000 to maybe $14,000 per door on kitchen and baths. This is not the $30,000, $60,000, $80,000 a door total renovation that some people undertake. We may remove that from same-store. And if we did, we have done that very limited, we removed that from same-store ourselves when we do something of that magnitude. Connor Wagner : Thank you guys very much. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Wans Nabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Wans Nabria : Good morning. I was hoping you could comment a little bit on the performance of A\u2019s and B\u2019s you're seeing across the market and maybe specifically between New York and San Francisco? David Santee : Well, I guess I would say that San Francisco especially all of our communities kind of down the Peninsula what have you, are mostly be communities, garden communities. I am not sure it\u2019s about A\u2019s and B\u2019s. I think it\u2019s more about location, supply, pricing of that supply, so there is no definitive obvious answer to your question. Wans Nabria : And across the portfolio? Any comments you could make about A versus B? David Neithercut : Again it\u2019s sub market by sub market. We can tell you that one sub market maybe doing, as David just did about downtown San Francisco versus East Bay but that\u2019s more sub market versus sub market rather than A versus B. David Santee : I mean a lot of it has to do with market momentum. I mean, you look at our DC portfolio in the District. We have high end building that we bought in the last downturn that were built to condo and specs that are doing just as well as the 30-year-old old Charles E. Smith portfolio up Connecticut Avenue. So again it\u2019s probably more about location and the impact of supply. Wans Nabria : Okay. Great. Thank you. And you made some comments earlier about concessions and gift cards. But if we combine those two, what was the change 2017 over 2016, and do you have those numbers for New York and San Fran? Mark Parrell : Well I gave it. It\u2019s Mark Parrell, for the whole portfolio a moment ago. And it would have moved the number 0.10, so 0.10 lower. We actually have lower concessions than we had last year. So that isn\u2019t going to make any difference. The concessions right now are $100,000 a quarter. They\u2019re just not that material. They were more than significant first quarter of this year. Wans Nabria : And that includes the gift cards, or that's a separate bucket? Mark Parrell : Gift cards and expenses accounted for under leasing and adverting. Concessions are accounted for the month that they\u2019re given as a reduction in revenue. Wans Nabria : But if you combine the two, because they're essentially kind of getting to the same ends\u2026 Mark Parrell : You have combined the two because the same-store revenue numbers reported on a cash basis and then the deduction is already made for the concession. So all you need to do is subtract the gift cards which was the number I gave earlier. Wans Nabria : Got you. Okay, thank you for that. And just one quick question on kind of 2017 and how we should be thinking about renewal spreads versus new with how you're thinking about things today or maybe for the fourth quarter and kind of how that may trend going forward? Mark Parrell : Well, I guess I would say kind of going back to the last downturn which is probably the best comparison. We were still able to maintain positive renewal growth. And most recently DC which is probably a market that \u2013 many markets could mirror in the next year we were able to achieve high 2s to mid 3s on renewals. So I think regardless of what the markets do we should be able to achieve favorable renewal revenue growth. Wans Nabria : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Rob Stevenson : Good morning guys. A few questions away from San Francisco and New York, if I might. David Santee, I think when you were talking in your prepared comments about DC, you mentioned, I think, 8 of 10 of the sub markets there showing strong growth or accelerating growth. Can you just talk a little bit about those two that aren't, what are they and is that just all supply related? David Santee : Yes, it is. Let me get to it. Give me one second. Rob Stevenson : Well, let me ask David Neithercut a question, while you're flipping ahead. David, you sold the Berkeley land parcel. It looks like you've got $115 million in the supplement of land for development in the future. How many projects is that? Or are we likely to see any of that starting in the next couple of quarters? David Neithercut : It\u2019s possible. We got some land sites in Boston that were really \u2013 land sites where densely, we were able to carve out of the existing deals that we had previously acquired that could create some development potential. But we\u2019re going to watch this all very, very closely Rob. We started very little this year after running about $1 billion average in 2013 and 2014, we cut that by almost two-thirds in 2015 and cut it by another two-thirds in 2016. We\u2019re down considerably. So we\u2019re going to watch all that very carefully. And I am not saying that we were not going to start anything, but whatever that starts will be, at least the present time will de minimis relative to what we have been doing. Rob Stevenson : Okay. And then one for Mark in terms of, what's the $0.05 difference between the fourth quarter guidance on a NAREIT in a normalized FFO basis? Mark Parrell : So that\u2019s the \u2013 we moved Rob from the third quarter the sale of a piece of land that\u2019s in the Northeast, so that\u2019s the $0.05 difference. Rob Stevenson : Okay. And back to David Santee on DC. David Santee : Okay. The two markets that are not accelerating are the Bethesda Chevy Chase market which represents about two or three properties for us, 9% of revenue and then far out Fairfax which is 5% of revenue. So the bulk of our revenue in DC is accelerating. Rob Stevenson : And that's just because those two sub markets are getting hit with supply, or is the demographics moving away from that? What are you identifying as the primary issues there? David Santee : So Fairfax I would say is probably more supply, Bethesda is probably more of a demographic. Rob Stevenson : Okay. All right. Perfect. I appreciate it, guys. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities. Tom Lesnick : Hi, Thanks for taking my question. Most of them have already been answered, but just curious on the financing side. You guys clearly have one of the lowest cost of capital of all REITs, and I think the most recent bond deal is indicative of that. But on the working capital side, how do you guys think about using the mix of your line and commercial paper? And are there specific instances in which you would be compelled to use one over the other? Mark Parrell : Hi, it\u2019s Mark Parrell. Thanks for that question Tom. So right now, we have about $200 million of commercial paper outstanding and nothing outstanding underline of credit. And I'll tell you the main reason, we use the CP program is that it's another talk in a money and right now which is vastly cheap. CP now has being priced at LIBOR plus 30 basis points, on line a credit it\u2019s LIBOR plus 95. We are saving more than half a percent on that. So the way we think about using the CP is an adjunct to our line of credit and when it is cheaper or that market is cheaper for some reason or better for some other reason we will use the CP capability that we have. Tom Lesnick : Great, thank you very much. Operator : We will have next from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Tayo Okusanya : Good morning. Two quick ones from me. First of all, again back to New York and San Francisco. In regards to underlying trends for renewals, I think everyone gets the fact that for new leases, rental rates have come down a lot. Could you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing with renewals? Has the situation with new rents caused existing tenants also to start to become more aggressive about asking for concessions or lower rents, or what have you when they come up for renewal? And how do you see that playing out going into 2017? David Neithercut : I think what we've seen over the eight or nine years that we've been tracking this is that, number one most residents are just programmed to expect some kind of increase from their landlord. Our expenses go up every year regardless of what happens with revenue. The other thing we see is that - the two things that people don't like most are negotiating or conflict and moving. So we see a vast majority as long as we send out reasonable requests you know a great percentage of people will check the box and choose to renew so that they don't have to relocate and go to the hassle of moving. And then there's you know then there's a very small percentage those are always the holdouts that you know kind of renew with the very last minute. And you know there are people that are well educated on what's going on in the market and those are the pros that you have to work with. Tayo Okusanya : Okay. But as a subset of people where there may be some pressure, but again, it's just a subset. David Neithercut : Yes, the majority, again assuming were reasonable. It's played out the same we've tracked it year-after-year it's a pretty solid trend. Tayo Okusanya : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then just another quick one, just in the Bay area and San Francisco again, a lot of conversation around increased rent control initiatives showing up on the ballots during the election season. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing from that perspective, and what could be the potential risk to your portfolio out there? David Neithercut : Sure. So in terms of you work the exposure that we have it's about three property 6.4% of total NOI of San Francisco only. Okay, so it's very small percentage of the total portfolio. I would tell you that the details are unclear. As an example Mountain View has two separate items on the ballot, one is put forth by to the council and the other one is a just a voter initiative both of which have two different approaches to any potential outcomes. So that's all that I can tell you today. So we will just have to wait and see what the outcome is on the election and you know ultimately what the fine print will be. Tayo Okusanya : Okay, much appreciate it, thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay : Good morning, guys. Do you think increased regulation of Airbnb could lead to another step down in demand? As you look to formulate your guidance, is this something you might contemplate? And it looks like you guys might be doing some pilot programs with Airbnb. Do you have a sense of how much overall room demand you get from Airbnb? David Santee : This is David Santee, I guess I would say that you know the legislation that occurred in New York City I believe is a benefit to us. Historically you know the state would, or the city, I am sorry, would find the building owner if any transient rentals were discovered and transient rentals mean anything less than 30 days.  On the other hand they do allow sharing as long as the owner is in occupancy, so I am not really sure how that gets policed and so I would say to what extent it affects Airbnb, I am not sure. But we do have a pilot, one property, we continue to learn, we continue to understand how to build-out this platform to really for the purpose of transparency and control. This would not be a huge money maker for any particular owner or any particular property, this is more about transparency, control, managing something that is already happening and will happen regardless. Wes Golladay : Okay, excellent. Do you think as a percentage of demand, it would be relatively small, the people that were in an apartment and then just sublet it out various nights on Airbnb, do you think that's a smaller part versus the people that maybe every once in a while, they're in the apartment and they just rent out the other room they have. Do you think that's a bigger part of the picture? David Santee : Yes, I mean I don't know, I guess, I don\u2019t understand Airbnb that much, I know they kind of put out what percentages of people that rent out entire spaces and what percentage of people rent out rooms. I guess I would say if there is a large percentage of people that rent out their entire space in New York, then that's going to be a problem for them. Wes Golladay : Okay. I hear you. It's a hard one to track. Thanks a lot. David Santee : Yes, and it\u2019s just not an important part of the overall picture for us. What being Airbnb is doing or not doing in any particular market has no impact on the way we think about our expected revenue for the upcoming year. Wes Golladay : That's what I was trying to get at. It could be a component of a demand, and it could be just 1% or 10 Bips of overall city demand for people that want to run mini businesses from Airbnb\u2026 David Santee : We don\u2019t allow those people. So we don\u2019t allow anyone to rent an apartment from us with the sole purpose of running an Airbnb business. David Neithercut : That is one of the benefits of the pilot is to have the transparency to prevent that. Wes Golladay : Yes, that's exactly what I was trying to get at. So you don't have any of that subletting going on in your - unoccupied sub letting. Okay. That's what I was looking for. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley Unidentified Analyst : This is [Ronald Camden] [ph] on Richard Hill's line. Thank you for your time. Just two quick ones from me. One, going back to DC, you mentioned bringing in suburban renters to downtown. Just curious which suburbs are they coming from? And is there a way to quantify that for us so we can get a sense? David Neithercut : Yes, we did that a couple, I think a year or so ago when we saw tremendous absorption of units on top of virtually zero job growth. And we just picked the handful of properties and look to see where people's previous address was when they applied and what have you. And it was clear that lot of people were - I mean just around the gateway we are choosing to live in a city. I mean we have our office at 1500 Mass Avenue, downtown DC, we moved it from Tysons Corner and then we have people to live out near Culpeper and what have you, And it can take them - it can take them two hours just to get to the bridge to get across the river and then another hour just to go get across the bridge to the office. So, if you ever lived in DC, I live there three times, it's a very difficult place to get around and there is every reason in the world why someone would want to move from the suburbs into the city today. Unidentified Analyst : Great. That's helpful. And then the last one, when I look at, take a step back looking at the portfolio of Southern California with same-store revenue growth above 5%, compared to New York, with the supply issues that you mentioned, when you think of longer term steady-state growth, what do those numbers look like? Is it one where, do they get to 3% to 4% type range. Where do you guys see a sustainable number for those two markets? Thanks. David Neithercut : I guess, I won't talk about specifically about those markets but just in general in the markets in which we have elected to invest our capital and\u2026 Unidentified Analyst : Yes. That would be great. David Neithercut : The presentation we put our website that does show over extended time period, the outside revenue growth in these markets, the outside increased in sort of underlying asset values in those markets compared to other markets. So like I said about those specifically, but just long term outperformance of these coast and gateway cities in which we have invested relative to more commodity like markets in a country, in general we got several slides on our website that we'll address that for you. Unidentified Analyst : Great. That's all for me. Thanks so much, guys. Operator : And next we'll hear from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Dennis McGill : Thank you. The first question, sorry if I missed this, but did you give the new lease growth and renewal growth that was finalized for the third quarter for the company-wide? David Neithercut : Yes, that was 3.1%. Dennis McGill : Separately the new lease and then the renewal? David Neithercut : Okay. So renewal yes - renewal was for the quarter - renewal rates achieved were 5.3% and new lease pricing was plus 90 basis points for combined number of 3.1%. Dennis McGill : Perfect. And do you have the assumption that's baked into 4Q for those same numbers? David Neithercut : No, we do not. Dennis McGill : Separately, with regard to the development pipeline, just cost to go vertical, any kind of color you can provide on what you're seeing for both labor and material costs and all-in costs of vertical construction and how you guys think that might trend over the next 12 to 18 months? David Santee : Well, across our market we are looking at the growth in hard in cost anywhere from 2% to as high as 6% and 7%. And that's on top of 3% to 7% growth or so a year ago. So we're looking at continued increase in cost a lot of that driven by labor and you know this is just another reason why we believe that we are going to see a reduction in starts and reduction in new deliveries going out, because land prices were up, the hard cost are up and those two yields are roughly low. So we are certainly seeing solid middle or single digit growth. We are expecting growth year-over-year on top of on a light growth of one year ago. Dennis McGill : And David, if you do get a pull back in supply, whether that's capital driven or some other reason, do you think there's an opportunity to that to alleviate some of this burden and lessen that cost increase? David Neithercut : Well, I guess costs are just being driven, but what's going on in new supply. Labors being - these costs are being driven by what\u2019s going on lots of different places and in Boston lot it\u2019s been impact of some casino that\u2019s been built. So, it\u2019s not simply and only exclusively multifamily and but certainly I mean if there is a reduction you\u2019d expect there to be a modest some reduction in construction overall you'd expect to see this growth rate to moderate. Dennis McGill : That's helpful. Appreciate guys. Operator : And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. McKenna at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Marty McKenna : Well, thank you all, appreciate your time today. We look forward seeing many of you Phoenix, and go Cubs. Operator : That concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead. Marty McKenna : Thank you, Ashley. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential\u2019s fourth quarter 2016 results and outlook for 2017. Our featured speakers today are David Neithercut, our President and CEO; David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Parrell, our Chief Financial Officer. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. And now I will turn the call over to David Neithercut. David Neithercut : Thank you, Marty and good morning everybody. Thank you for joining us for today\u2019s call. 2016 represented the culmination of a very important multiyear process for Equity Residential as we completed the transformation of the company\u2019s portfolio, with the sale of nearly 30,000 apartment units and the return of $4 billion to our shareholders in special dividends in what\u2019s been noted by many as one of the most investor-friendly transaction seen in years. Unfortunately, 2016 also brought about an abrupt downturn slowdown in apartment fundamentals as new supply entered the market at a time of slowing job growth, particularly in the growth of higher paying jobs. And as a result, after 5 years of extraordinarily strong fundamentals, our same-store revenue growth in 2016 came in at 3.7%, down from the 5.1% growth delivered in 2015 and more in line with long-term historical trends. Now as noted in last night\u2019s press release, we expect revenue growth to continue to weaken in 2017 with nearly all of our markets expected to deliver same-store revenue growth for this year below 2016 actual performance with Washington, DC being the lone exception. Weakness in fundamentals is not the result of much of any change in the underlying demand for rental housing across our portfolio. On the contrary, occupancy remains strong today and is expected to moderate only slightly through the year. Turnover across all markets, when excluding same property movement actually improved last year, dropping to 48%, a 100 basis point improvement over 2015 and consistent with our expectations for 2017. And move-outs to buy single-family homes remains a non-factor in our high cost of housing markets. Furthermore, while our markets have experienced a slowdown in the growth of high-income jobs, the absolute number of new high-income jobs remains relatively strong. And perhaps more importantly, for the first time since the recovery began, there are abundant signs of wage growth occurring in all industries across the country, which obviously is a very good sign for the apartment business. So as we look ahead to what we see as peak deliveries in many of our markets this year, our teams across the country will work very hard, delighting our existing residents and extending their stay with us, while welcoming prospects and turning them into new residents. And we remain extraordinarily excited about the long-term outlook for our business, portfolio and the company. So with that said, I will let David Santee go into more detail about our outlook for 2017. David Santee : Okay. Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Before I jump into the numbers, I\u2019d like to first acknowledge the commitment and efforts of all of our employees over the past year. While results were certainly bumpy, it only strengthened our resolve to do better. I know our teams are keenly aware of the challenges before us. And I am 100% confident that they will go above and beyond to deliver in \u201817. While markets have now returned to pre-2014, \u201815 seasonality, there continues to be strong demand for high-quality apartments in great locations and occupancy remains above historic norms. Today, I will focus my comments on the assumptions that make up our full year forecast on a market-by-market basis. I will provide you with lease-over-lease growth rates, expected renewal rates achieved, any material changes in occupancy and the percent of contribution to same-store revenue growth that together get you to the midpoint of our full year guidance. I will also discuss what we see in the markets today and provide color on the new deliveries and how much or little we expect them to impact us based on our geographic footprint. I can address any 2016 questions in the session \u2013Q&A session afterwards. So I will start with the markets that we expect to have the most positive impact on our 2017 revenue growth and finish with New York, which will have a negative impact on our performance this year. Los Angeles will contribute around 40% of our growth this year. With job growth remaining steady, we are forecasting lease-over-lease growth of 1.8%, renewal rate growth of 5.4% and a 20 bps decline from 2016 occupancy. These assumptions would deliver 3.6% total revenue growth in 2017. As you know, Los Angeles is the collection of several large submarkets. About half of the new supply in 2017 will be focused in downtown L.A. as we witnessed the creation of a 24/7 downtown for the first time in the city\u2019s history and will pressure our footprint there which represents 16% of L.A. same-store revenue. The remaining new units are spread across the Valley and specifically, Pasadena, which represent 24% of our revenue. There are virtually no new deliveries in West L.A., where we have 25% of our revenue, or in the Santa Clarita or other suburban markets which account for 35% of revenue. On to DC, DC continues to show acceleration and will contribute 21% of our total same-store revenue growth in 2017. Lease-over-lease growth is forecast at plus 80 basis points, renewal growth of 4.4%, with occupancy essentially unchanged. Full year revenue growth would be 1.8%. While news of the federal hire increase causes us to take pause, history tells us that frozen federal jobs are simply replaced with outside contractors and higher wages. However, the actual order says that the hiring of contractors to circumvent the order is not allowed. Like other initiatives the administration has put forth, there remains more questions than answers on the potential impact to our markets, our industry, both at the city and national level. But we still remain confident that demographics will continue to drive strong demand apartments. In the DC Metro, 2017 new supply will be slightly elevated from 2016 and approximately a third of those new units will be competing head-to-head with the majority of our entire DC footprint with the largest concentrations in the RBC Corridor and Arlington. The Navy Yard in Southwest DC will continue to deliver units, but neighborhood amenities and services are not following at the same pace, creating a less desirable but more affordable location. The remaining deliveries are dispersed across many popular suburban locations like Tysons Corner, Reston, around the Beltway to Rockford, Gaithersburg and Prince George\u2019s counties, which all should bode well for continuing improvement in the district. Seattle will contribute about 20% of full year same-store portfolio revenue growth. Lease-over-lease growth is forecast at 3%, renewal rate at 6.2%. With no change in occupancy, our most likely revenue growth for 2017 is 4.25%. With deliveries in 2017 basically the same as 2016, we have yet to see any price pressures as strong demand for rental housing continues to be driven by employers like Amazon and Microsoft. We continue to produce strong results, while expanding their footprint into new business lines or next-generation technologies. The tech stalwarts are also expanding their employment base in the Greater Metropolitan area to better compete with talent, and Seattle continues to have the lowest absolute rents and taxes of any other market in which we operate. No difference in the past 3 years, most 2017 deliveries in Seattle will go head-to-head with our portfolio. Our 4.25% revenue growth reflects our expectation of moderation as a result of increase in competition. Additionally, prohibitions on upfront non-refundable move-in fees that were recently enacted by the Seattle City Council will negatively impact our 2017 revenue growth by 30 basis points. There is still uncertainty around the new ordinance regarding pet rent [ph] that could have a negative impact of an additional 20 basis points that is not captured in our forecast. Contributing 10% each of full year revenue growth are San Francisco, Orange County, San Diego and Boston. San Francisco finished the year by returning to the seasonal pattern that we experienced through 2013 versus the power years of 2014 and \u201815. Currently, San Francisco is best described as stable, with minimal pricing power on new leases as a result of tax stagnation and new supply. Lease over lease rate is expected to be negative 1.5% as expiring leases continue to roll down from market highs and we forecast a 40 basis point decline in occupancy to 95.7%. Renewal rates of 2.9% will offset the negative new lease rate to deliver full year positive revenue growth of 1%. With deliveries in 2017 up from last year, the South Bay will feel the greatest impact where almost half of the deliveries are concentrated. And we have 30% of total revenues in San Francisco. The CBD will see 25% of the deliveries and will impact 18% of our [Technical Difficulty]. We would expect our Peninsula and East Bay assets to deliver better results as only about 20% of the new supply will be delivered in these two large submarkets that combined, make up 53% of our total MSA revenue. Orange County continues to have strong demand as a result of solid job growth, but we will see a significant increase in new deliveries in \u201817. More than half will be concentrated at Irvine, where we have 30% of revenue. The balance of new deliveries, primarily Anaheim and Far North Orange should have little impact on the remaining 70% of our Orange County revenue, which is South and Southeast. As a result, lease over lease is forecast at 2.5%, renewal rate at 6% and little change in occupancy that would deliver full year revenue growth of 4.25%. Like Orange County, San Diego will see increased new supply in 2017, with half concentrated in Downtown, where we have 25% of our revenue. With steady job growth and an expected increase in military spending, we would expect the balance of our portfolio to be modestly impacted by the remaining new supply in the near-term. Lease over lease growth is expected to be 1.8%, while renewal growth remains strong at 5%. New supply causes us to reduce occupancy by 30 basis points off a strong comp of 96.2 that we achieved in 2016. All-in, we expect revenue growth of 3.75%. Moving on to Boston, over the last 18 months Boston and its urban core have experienced respectable gain since the elevated deliveries in 2015 and a significant drop in 2016. However in 2017, we will see more new units delivered with 50% in the urban core and Cambridge, followed by a 30% Far North of Downtown with the remaining 20% West than South. 75% of our total Boston revenue will compete with these new deliveries. Job growth has been steady in high profile corporate relocations like GE and Reebok are encouraging signs that this round of supply will produce results similar to 2014 and 2015, where demand kept occupancy strong with no pricing power on new leases, but respectable renewals kept growth positive. For those reasons, we forecast lease over lease growth to be dilutive by 70 basis points, but strong renewal rate growth of 3.9%. With a modest pickup in occupancy, full year revenue growth would then be 1.5%. Finally, New York City is expected to have a negative impact on our 2017 performance. We also see New York as the market that has the highest potential for volatility to the downside with an increased amount of high end units being delivered into an environment where job growth is relatively mediocre and the biggest gains are in the lower paying sectors of education, leisure and hospitality. Financial services are contracting and tech job expansion has stalled. Our expectation of a 150 basis point decline in revenues assumes the decline of 3.5% in lease over lease rate, a 2.1% increase on a renewal rate and a 40 basis point decline in occupancy. Unlike all of our other markets, our expectations for this market has substantial move-in concessions built in. In summary, there continues to be strong demand for high quality apartments in great locations. Occupancy remains above historic norms. However, near-term supply will create geographic pockets that will lose pricing power on new leases in the short-term. David? David Neithercut : Alright. Thank you, David. Following a year in which we sold nearly $7 billion of assets, 2017 will look slight tame on the capital allocation front. But the investment teams will be working very hard seeking to maximize total return on invested capital in their respective markets. 2017 guidance assumes $500 million of acquisition activity, funded by a like amount of disposition activity at a negative spread of 75 basis points. Now, I want to make it clear that after having backed up the truck last year as we sold nine core assets, there is very little that we believe needs to be sold in 2017. So we will transact if and when we find an opportunity to redeploy that capital into a higher fully return asset. The investment team will also be focused on our rehab activity in 2017, where we expect to spend $50 million this year, covering approximately 4,500 units and would expect our past returns on this capital of 12% to 14% to be achievable again this year. Last year, Equity Residential completed the highest dollar volume of new developments in our history in five assets, totaling $1.1 billion of project costs. And in 2017, we will also complete nearly $900 million of additional new developments and this will contrast sharply with 2018, when we will complete just one development project, that being what would be the last remaining project underway, our $88 million 220 unit project at 100 K Street in Washington, DC. Clearly, we have throttled back our development activity in the face of rising land and construction costs and declining yields. At the present time, we have two potential development starts this year, totaling only $100 million. Beyond that, we will continue to work on several existing operating assets where we hope to upsize our density in order to build additional units. And have just two remaining land sites in inventory that were acquired and are currently held for future development with a carrying value of less than $60 million. Now this does not suggest that we won\u2019t continue to look for opportunities to develop more projects and create new long-term streams of income for the company because our teams continued to look for those opportunities every day. But after a terrific long-term run of realizing development yields well in excess of current cap rates and creating meaningful long-term value for our shareholders in the face of elevated new supply and slowing revenue growth, we have opted to take a more cautious approach to development at this time. So I will now turn the call over to Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Thank you, David. I want to take a few minutes this morning to talk about our expense and our normalized FFO guidance for 2017 as well as our capital expenditure plans. And then I will close with a few comments on our balance sheet activity and our sources and uses. So first, on the same-store expenses, we have provided a range of 3% to 4% for our 2017 same-store expense growth. I am going to go through a few of the main drivers of that at the moment. On the real estate tax side, we expect an increase of between 4% and 5%, with 1.8 percentage points of the increase coming from the 421a burn off in New York. Markets with the largest increases in property taxes are Boston, New York and Washington, DC. For payroll expense, we expect an increase of between 4% and 5% as we face pressure to retain our property level employees in a very competitive market. We have also added staff in some markets to provide even better service to our residents and to support tenant retention. Switching over to utilities, which is our third largest expense category, we anticipate an increase of approximately 2%. In each of the last 2 years, our annual utility expense has declined, so this is a bit of a normalization year. Also, we are seeing some pressure on our repair and maintenance line item. This is due to increases in the minimum wage that impact our outside cleaning and landscaping vendors. We estimate that in 2017 we will incur approximately $1.5 million in additional cost due to minimum wage pressure. And that\u2019s going to add about 20 basis points to total expense growth from these increases in minimum wage. For the leasing and advertising expense line item, after a big increase of 19% in 2016 versus 2015, we have budgeted leasing and advertising expense to be flat in 2017 versus 2016. The increase in 2016 was driven by increased promotional spending and that included gift cards and owner payment of broker fees and approximated about $1.6 million and was spent predominantly in New York, with a lesser increase across the portfolio in Internet advertising cost. We expect a lot of competition in markets with significant supply and we feel they are maintaining spending levels in this category as necessary for the time being. Let\u2019s switch over to our normalized FFO guidance. Our range for normalized FFO for 2017 is $3.05 to $3.15 per share comparing our 2016 normalized FFO to $3.09 per share to the $3.10 per share midpoint of our guidance for 2017. I want to hit on a few of the main drivers. First, our portfolio of 15 properties, totaling about 5,300 units that are in various stages of lease-up should create a total of $85 million to $95 million of NOI. As compared to 2016, this is an incremental contribution to our results of $41 million or about $0.11 per share. We are excited about the current cash flow and about the long-term value creation that these assets will bring Equity Residential. We will caution that cash flows during lease-ups can be volatile due to the lease of timing and changes in rental rate and concession estimates. We expect an additional contribution in normalized FFO of about $4 million or about $0.01 per share from other non-same-store properties, so adding that all up, you get a total positive contribution in the non-same-store category of about $45 million or about $0.12 per share. Second, we expect to have a positive impact of about $0.04 per share from same-store NOI growth in 2017. And offsetting these positive items will be a reduction in NOI of about $48 million or $0.12 per share from our expensive 2016 sale activity, including the Starwood sale. Also on the negative side, we estimate an impact of approximately $0.02 per share from higher total interest expense. We will benefit from the sizable pay downs of high coupon debt we made in the first quarter of 2016, but we will feel a larger negative impact from significantly lower capitalized interest this year as most of our development projects have now been placed into service. We will also have a negative impact of about $0.01 per share from other items which includes lower fee in asset management income. Remember, we did sell Fort Lewis during 2016 and lower amounts of expected interest income. Remember, we expect to have considerable lower cash balances in 2017 than 2016. In another item of note, we expect lower overhead costs, which we define as G&A combined with property management, in 2017 versus 2016 by about $3 million. We have mostly completed rightsizing our overhead platform to our smaller property footprint. As you can see, the robust growth in lease-up NOI that we anticipate in 2017 as well as the more modest NOI growth of the same-store portfolio is being obscured by the lost NOI from our substantial 2016 dispositions. If you adjust prior periods with these sales and for the related debt pay-downs, our average rate of normalized FFO growth from 2014 to 2017 will be a very strong rate of about 7% per year. Now on to the CapEx area, in 2017, we expect to spend $2,600 per same-store unit in capitalized expenditures as compared to $2,235 per same-store unit that we spent in 2016. Included in this is approximately $17 million of additional spend. The customer-facing renovation projects, examples include common areas, leasing offices and exercise rooms. As you know, much of the new product that is being delivered into our market is targeted at the higher end renter. We are making sure that our incredibly well-located assets are able to continue to compete with this new product. This increased spend will be reflected in the line Building Improvements on Page 23 of our supplement. We expect this spend to normalize back down over time. Continuing on CapEx and continuing our commitment to sustainability in all we do, we are planning to increase our spending on projects in the sustainability area by about $8 million in 2017. These projects tend to have very high rates of return on invested capital. Also, the $50 million kitchen and bath rehab program that David Neithercut just discussed should generate strong returns on invested capital. The spending on this program is included in the $2,600 per same-store unit guidance number that I previously quoted. Now, a bit on sources and uses in the balance sheet. The fourth quarter was certainly a busy one for our finance and legal teams. We replaced our $2.5 billion revolving line of credit which was scheduled to mature in about a year with a new cheaper $2 billion unsecured revolving line of credit that matures on January 2022. We made our line of credit smaller to reflect the reduction in the size of the company and the prepayment of a significant amount of debt during the first quarter of 2016. We had strong interest from our bank group in renewing the facility and we are able to obtain market leading terms. We also issued $500 million of 10-year unsecured notes at a coupon of 2.85% and an all-in effective rate of 3.1%. This is the lowest 10-year issuance we have ever done. We also paid $1.1 billion or $3 per share in a cash special dividend in the fourth quarter. These actions now left the company\u2019s balance sheet and liquidity position in an excellent place going into what appears to be a more volatile period. Currently, we have approximately $60 million in cash and have about $200 million in outstanding commercial paper, leaving availability of about $1.8 billion under our new $2 billion revolving line of credit. At the end of 2017, we expect the line of credit or the commercial paper program to have about $550 million balance. I am going to give you a quick summary of some of the cash inflows and outflows. Our guidance includes a $400 million debt issuance in the second half of the year. We expect to payoff $630 million in debt as it matures during 2017 and recall about $340 million of debt that matures in later years, so a total of $970 million of debt repayments during 2017. We will spend about $300 million in 2017 completing our development projects, leaving us with cost of only about $40 million in 2018 to complete our current development starts. Acquisition and disposition activity is anticipated to be about equal in amount. And our guidance assumes that dispositions are slightly front-loaded for the year versus acquisitions occurring ratably over the course of the year. Now I am going to turn the call back over to the operator for the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Juan Sanabria from Bank of America. Juan Sanabria : Hi, good morning. I was just hoping you could speak to the 2017 guidance on the core business of same-store revenue and NOI and just give us a sense of the main variance items between the low and the high end, whether it\u2019s macro assumptions or supply/concessions or whatever color you can provide? David Neithercut : And by that, do you mean how do we set the guidance range for normalized FFO? Juan Sanabria : No. For same-store revenue and NOI, what\u2019s the main variance between the low and high-end, what assumptions change? Mark Parrell : Well, it\u2019s primarily revenue-driven. I would say that in places like obviously, Los Angeles, where we have the largest contribution to growth with the same-store portfolio, we are just assuming more volatility or providing a range for more volatility. New York, same story, New York is probably one of the most undisciplined markets when it comes to pricing and concessions and what have you. So we have assumed a certain level of concessions and rolled down in pricing. But there is more volatility that could happen there than we expect. Juan Sanabria : Okay, thanks. And then on the supply side, any skew across the top markets between the first half and the second half of \u201917, how are you guys thinking about kind of the trends in results from over the course of the year in \u201817? David Neithercut : Yes. I guess I would say that as we built up the budgets from the ground up, we understood when the bulk of the units were coming, whether its front loaded, spread across, equally across the fourth quarter or if it was more back end loaded. So the pace of those deliveries, are embedded in our revenue assumptions. Juan Sanabria : But can you provide any color on kind of maybe Northern California, specifically, what \u2013 how you expect supply to play out over \u201817? David Santee : I don\u2019t have that level of detail. David Neithercut : Suffice it to understand, one, we are certainly aware of the deliveries. And with completion being sort of defined as when the property is finally completed and delivered, we understand when first units will be available and that 60 days, 90 days in advance of that, they will start marketing very strenuously. And so we keep \u2013 take all that into account as we pull our numbers together. Juan Sanabria : Okay, thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi. Nick Joseph : Thanks. David, you mentioned New York City had the most variability in terms of potential outcomes and I think you mentioned at the midpoint, you are assuming down 1.5%, but can you talk about kind of the low end and where that \u2013 where the downside could be for that market? Mark Parrell : Well, I think it all comes down to level of concessions. We have certainly prepared for a certain level of concessions. But you are already hearing some crazy stuff like three months and four months free on 12-month leases. I mean certainly, if that becomes widespread across the entire MSA, then you can get to negative three pretty quick. So that\u2019s kind of our worst case scenario on New York City. Nick Joseph : And how do you think about the use of concessions within your portfolio for New York versus using gift cards and does the same-store revenue guidance at 1.5% assume any use of gift cards or maybe that\u2019s being run through the expense line item there? Mark Parrell : Yes. So let me just explain our overarching strategy for the company and then specifically, New York. We have always thought to be a net effective rent shop. The only market that we have budgeted significant concessions and its $4 million is New York City. We have \u2013 we budgeted the same level of gift cards that we spent last year, but everyone is very clear that, that is a tool that we will only use if absolutely necessary. So our first line of defense is rate, second, concessions and last, gift cards. Nick Joseph : Thanks. And just one other question, for same-store revenue growth, there has been a deceleration on a year-over-year basis every quarter since third quarter of \u201815, but when you look out to 2017 guidance, do you expect that to stabilize at some point, in the back half of 2017 and could there be a reacceleration? David Neithercut : Our guidance assumption now assumes a gradual decline in same-store revenue quarterly numbers throughout the year. Nick, certainly it would be great if there was some sort of reacceleration, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s presumed in our numbers. Nick Joseph : Thanks. Operator : And we will take our next question from Nick Yulico with UBS. Nick Yulico : Thanks. I appreciate all the market level detail on the guidance. I guess going back to New York and San Francisco, the assumptions you gave on new lease growth for each market, how does that compare to where new lease growth is \u2013 was in the fourth quarter and so far in January? David Santee : Well, let me say this. This is why \u2013 I can give you an example of the fourth quarter numbers, but we know from tracking this for the last 10 years that if the market is even stable, the likelihood of having negative lease over lease growth in Q4 is a likely outcome, because you have a disproportionate of people breaking their leases in Q4 versus regular lease expirations. So just to give you an extreme example, so New York in Q4 was a minus 5.3, okay. But almost every market is negative. So basically, you are re-letting units at \u2013 that were at premiums and now you are re-letting them at lower rents. However, you have very few transactions. So you can\u2019t extrapolate the direction of the market from those numbers. So in Q1, it becomes less negative. And then in Q2 and Q3, it\u2019s very positive. And that\u2019s just how the cycle works pretty much every year. Nick Yulico : Okay. I guess what I am trying to get at is whether or not the guidance for New York and San Francisco is at the midpoint is assuming that both markets get tougher versus what you have actually been seeing on the ground of late, so whether you are actually building \u2013 how much conservatism you are building in for these markets this year would be helpful to understand? David Santee : Well, I guess we look at the quarterly numbers historically. We have to assume some level of rent growth, what are leases doing. In San Francisco for 2017, we assume that new lease rents will be flat over last year, right. So rents will be basically the same as they were last year, but people who have lived with us for 2 years, 18 months, are paying above market rents, so those will roll down. So we have incorporated all of that into our guidance on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Nick Yulico : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Mark, just going back to the development starts this year, I didn\u2019t catch that number on a dollar basis, what are the new starts likely to be? Mark Parrell : Let me just put two things together Nick for you. We have no starts assumed in guidance, so no spend on new starts. We have $300 million that we will spend completing things that have already started that you already see on our development page. David Neithercut referred to two deals we may start. If we do start them, they will have a material impact on guidance. I mean there will be draws on the revolver and slightly higher capitalized interest and it just won\u2019t make a great deal of difference to the FFO numbers for the year. Nick Yulico : Right, okay. I just but \u2013 just for the two developments that could start, what is the dollar amount of total cost for those projects? Mark Parrell : $100 million on those two deals, Nick. Nick Yulico : $100 million total? Mark Parrell : Correct. Nick Yulico : Okay. Total cost $100 million for two projects? David Neithercut : That\u2019s correct. Nick Yulico : Okay. So I guess my \u2013 that\u2019s helpful. My follow-up question here then is I mean if you think about it, I mean, you are essentially practically shutting down the development pipeline which means you are \u2013 you could have a lot more used potential for your free cash flow as you get out to next year. I mean, what are the thoughts about where that goes? I mean, are you going to increase your payout ratio on the dividend? Are you going to do more share repurchases? You are not going to have much in the way of future capital needs. David Neithercut : I think we will see at the time, but those two things are certainly would be part of the things that we would strongly consider. Nick Yulico : Thanks. David Neithercut : You bet. Operator : And we will take our next question from Conor Wagner with Green Street Advisors. Conor Wagner : Good morning. Mark Parrell : Good morning, Conor. Conor Wagner : You mentioned that disposition activity could be front-end loaded. What are you seeing on demand and pricing for the assets that you are looking to sell? And without giving away too much, could you tell us how those assets \u2013 how they fit in your overall portfolio. You mentioned David that you had sold largely all of your non-core assets. So, I assume these are assets that are in your remaining markets and closer to the average of your existing portfolio? Mark Parrell : Yes. And as I also noted, Conor, many of which would not be sold if there is not a redeployment sort of opportunity also on the horizon. So I would kind of think about them as more sort of pair of trades, if you will. We have $100 million or so of product that we had hoped to sell last year as part of the larger sort of non-core disposition program that did leak into this year. Beyond that, as I said during our prepared remarks, we have very little identified that we feel like we need to sell, but we do have product identified that we would sell if we could find the right reinvestment opportunity. Just with respect generally to valuations, I can tell you that of all that we sold a year ago or during 2017, we have sold that for about a 3% premium to what we had told our board that we probably could realize on that product. And I think that\u2019s a real testament to Alan George and his team for their ability to attract the market. Those guys are telling us today that values generally are kind of holding in there. That deals with some sort of story or some kind of structure here might be off a little bit on a year-over-year basis, but a great deal of our assets would be right in there, same valuation over a year ago and in some markets, maybe even up slightly from there. Conor Wagner : And then on that acquisition disposition strategy, do you have any desire to use that to shift your allocation between markets at all? Again, it\u2019s obviously a pair of trade strategy, but is there any portfolio refinement strategy baked into that? David Neithercut : I don\u2019t think so, Conor. I mean, certainly, we may sell an asset to one market, buy another and another but that\u2019s not be nearly going to change in any material way NOI concentration. So that won\u2019t be conducted with a specific desire to reduce one market and increase another market, but more just in response to whatever opportunities we may see. Conor Wagner : Okay. And then David in the last night\u2019s release, you noted at the beginning, just in the opening, just the strong demand that you guys are seeing in the potential for great returns in future years. What\u2019s your outlook for employment growth and supply growth in \u201818 and \u201819 and what\u2019s underpinning that constant outlook that you have for your portfolio? David Neithercut : Well, look, it\u2019s hard to ask me exactly where we think \u201818 supply is going to be, but we do think with land prices up and construction cost up and a lot of more traditional sort of construction lending sources maybe winding down a little bit, but there are lots of reasons to think that \u201818 deliveries will be below \u201817. And just with respect to demand, we just think that demographic picture remains very favorable. The job picture remains very favorable. Rising wages, we as you know operate in markets, which is processing. The family housing is very expensive. So we just believe that we have got a lot of residents that will stay with us and the demographic picture will bring more to the market. So, we remain \u2013 we think we have got peak deliveries in 2017. And as we have already discussed in great detail, that\u2019s we are going to have to work our way through that. But on the backside of that, we remain very optimistic on a multifamily business in general and certainly, very optimistic for the multifamily business in our core markets. Conor Wagner : Thank you very much. David Neithercut : You are welcome. Operator : And we will take our next question from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Rob Stevenson : Good morning, guys. Can you talk about what the current expectation in terms of stabilized yield is for the $960 million in the development pipeline? David Neithercut : Sure. I mean of the completions that we delivered last year, so that\u2019s about the $1.1 billion. We think these things will stabilize high 5s, low 6s and the product that we believe \u2013 and we will certainly complete yet this year will stabilize also in the high 5s, low 6s. Rob Stevenson : Okay. So the five projects that you guys have completed in California, the three in San Francisco, the one in San Jose and the one in L.A. that are already on your schedules completed, that already is sort of high 5s, low 6s? David Neithercut : Well, I am not saying it\u2019s already, because they are still in various stages of lease-up but we believe that when they do stabilize, they will stabilize in that ballpark. Rob Stevenson : Okay. And where is that relative to what you expected at underwriting? David Neithercut : Generally better. I will tell you that in those \u2013 in most of the products we have delivered, we are able to price these land and price construction costs at a different point in the cycle. So, our costs were very attractive. And we have seen, as you know, very strong revenue growth rental rate growth during that time period. So, while even our deals in San Francisco might be exceeding our original expectations, they might be a little off of what we had thought they might be at the beginning of \u201816, but still that will deliver at or modestly above our original expectations. Rob Stevenson : Okay. And then you talked about $50 million of redevelopment this year, what\u2019s the overall redevelopment opportunity in the portfolio? And is there any ability to bring some of that more forward and accelerate that over the next couple of years to $75 million or $100 million or is it really $50 million is about all you really can do at on an annual basis? David Neithercut : Well, that\u2019s a very good question, one that we have asked ourselves. But it just there is some capacity requirement, capacity limitations, not just of the number of trades that can do. One of the biggest things driving construction cost out there today is cost of labor. And it\u2019s just, I am not sure that we have the ability to find the vendors that would allow us in these markets to do more than what we are doing. So I guess I would tell you that I think we are probably doing about all we can in any given year. We have had about $50 million or so run-rate for the past 4 or 5 years probably. And I think that\u2019s probably a pretty good run-rate for us just given what we think the limitations are on labor out there in the marketplace. Rob Stevenson : Okay. Thanks, guys. David Neithercut : You bet, Rob. Operator : And we will take our next question from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Rich Hightower : Hi. Good morning, guys. David Neithercut : Good morning, Rich. Rich Hightower : So I got a couple of questions here. I am going to go back to David Santee\u2019s comments earlier in the prepared remarks about first, New York City being the only market where, I think \u201csubstantial concessions were built into the forecast for the year.\u201d Are there other markets where concessions are built in but they are less substantial? And if so, can you kind of give a little color around what those markets are at this point? David Neithercut : I guess, I would say that there is nothing \u2013 there are no markets that can come close to what we have budgeted in New York. Seattle, we put in probably $80,000 to really just because of the concentration within a couple of block area on some deliveries, we did a little bit maybe, call it, $90,000 in DC just because of some concentrations in a specific neighborhood. Other than that, there are no significant concessions budgeted. Rich Hightower : Okay. And so would you also say that the concessionary environment in San Francisco is abated pretty significantly? I guess that\u2019s from the statement. David Santee : Yes, I mean, look, the lease-ups are still giving concessions, that\u2019s just kind of as a standard operating procedure on new lease-ups. But we are, like I said, the market seems stable. Some people are offering concessions, but it\u2019s few and far between. And we think that now that the market has repriced in \u201816 that there is not really a need for concessions. David Neithercut : I guess, what we have seen Rich is the ability to maintain net effective lease pricing across most markets even when they sort of soften. And maybe DC is the perfect example. There are a lot of new supplies you know in DC in kind of \u201813 and \u201814 and we remain Dave, there was discipline sort of in the marketplace and we could continue to operate successfully at a net effective rate. New York is something where the marketplace as David said, originally is less disciplined and is one in which concessions can become problematic and we would have to respond. But away from New York, we found the ability to operate on a net effective basis fairly successful. Rich Hightower : Okay, great, that\u2019s helpful guys. Second question here, so going to Mark\u2019s comments about the balance sheet and how well positioned EQR is in the current environment with respect to liquidity and all the other sort of financing needs you have taken care of recently and he talked about anticipating volatility in the upcoming environment, so does that imply you see better opportunities for capital allocation maybe as a 2018, 2019 type of timeframe, I would also maybe compare and contrast that against the statements earlier about 2018, 2019 being better fundamentally, so where is the source of that volatility and what should we expect in terms of what EQR does about it? David Neithercut : Well, I guess the volatility with respect to the fundamentals, not necessarily with respect to assets sort of valuations. But again, we have four in the last 12 months, 18 months, I think taken a fairly, but not 2 years, taken a fairly cautious approach to investment. Certainly, I think as indicated by the large transaction we did last year with Starwood and the other subsequent dispositions and the big special dividend that we did. So look, we see a lot of new product coming out of these markets. We think there may be opportunities, should it make sense from a capital allocation standpoint to buy new product, it might make more sense to buy some of that product, rather than develop and take development risk, construction risk, lease-up risk, etcetera. So we are just taking a cautious approach, given all the new supply with respect to capital deployment. And as noted earlier, by having reduced the development up to this point and not having any meaningful spend in \u201818, we do create net cash flow which we could use for some other purposes. And we would not be afraid to use that for those other purposes. Rich Hightower : Alright. Thanks David. David Neithercut : You bet. Operator : And we will take our next question from Ivy Zelman with Zelman & Associates. Ivy Zelman : Hi guys. Hello. David Neithercut : Yes. We hear you. Ivy Zelman : I am sorry I am trying to get off speaker. I am sorry. Thank you for taking my question. And really excellent color on the markets and appreciate you not going to the \u201816 results, because I think everybody want to talk about \u201817 and how you are getting to your forecast. One question I had for you guys is with respect to turnover, I realized I think you said you expect flat turnover and you kind of went through with respect to occupancy by market, so some occupancy flat, some down 20 bps, 40 bps, here and there. One of the questions I had is with respect to appreciating the fragmentation of your business is pretty significant and there is a lot of arguably players that are not as well capitalized or may not be as the tenure of being in this business that are in fact telling us they are cutting prices in New York, for example, not concessions, cutting prices and so one of the things I think about is on a renewal basis, if you are a tenant and with the Internet and all the transparency on pricing, what\u2019s the risk that you will see turnover increasing as people recognize there is better opportunities and then if so, what does that do to NOI with the higher expenses on the turn, so that\u2019s my first question, just want to know what you have built in and why you are assuming flat in overall basis? David Neithercut : So I guess I would say that first of all, regardless of rate for renewal increases or lack thereof, we are going to try and retain any resident where it makes economic sense. Frankly, the hard costs associated with turnover are very minimal. New York has a lot of hardwood floors, so really you are paying call it, a couple of hundred bucks to paint the apartment and maybe $100 to clean it. So the real cost is in the vacancy. So our goal is to kind of minimize that vacancy. And I would say that when you look at our forecasted numbers and I gave you the breakdown, we forecasted basically 80 basis points lower in occupancy assuming that there could be people that choose to move in other locations because of the lack of neighborhood loyalty. One of the things we talk about is really what is \u2013 it used to be in New York City that people are very loyal to the neighborhoods and a very \u2013 neighborhoods are very desirable. You have got a big slug of new deliveries in Long Island City. What is the elasticity of our customer and their desire to go further out one more train stop to achieve a lower rent. So for all those reasons, we have kind of accounted for that with 80 basis points lower in occupancy for the full year. Ivy Zelman : And therefore, assumingly the volatility may be that you will need to meet whatever the pricing maybe at that time and retaining that customer as the strategy? David Neithercut : Yes. I mean the volatility would not be in rate. I mean rate would not immediately impact us. It would be in additional upfront concessions or significantly lower occupancy. Ivy Zelman : Got it. Thank you. And separately on transactions side, I think David you mentioned that your \u2013 the overall success that you have had and recycling older assets and bringing in newer assets and I think you obviously commend to the team that\u2019s done so, when you think about the transactions that you would have liked to have done or just understanding what\u2019s going on in the transaction market, there seems to be a bit outspread widening and that\u2019s probably more Class A urban and there has been some disappointment in the market that transactions that just didn\u2019t get done that they were hopeful would have got done or when they saw deals where we traded and they were traded 1% to 10% depending on the asset lower, you guys are saying you are not seeing that or maybe you can comment further on that, because that\u2019s definitely \u2013 a lot of people are saying in the industry that they are seeing the same thing? David Santee : I certainly would suggest that we are seeing did ask spreads widening. But I will tell you that the deals there that are getting done, we think are getting done and valuations that are not showing that kind of delta. Now may be deals are being pulled back in the marketplace, which seller is unwilling to sell at that kind of discount. But I also sort of just say just in support of that is that we are still seeing land prices very strong. We are still seeing construction cost going up and seeing no abatement in replacement costs, which are also going to be, I think the driver of underlying value of existing stabilized assets. Ivy Zelman : Right, very true. Lastly, just can you guys talk about the sensitivity of rising rates and recognizing you are extremely well capitalized, generating strong free cash flow, but just appreciating what can that do to your competitors because some people are just really not as well capitalized and again it\u2019s highly fragmented, so how does that impact the competitive nature of the market for new move-ins and renewals from the way you have modeled \u201817 guidance and what are you assuming I guess for where rates are going to go in your modeling? Mark Parrell : Ivy, it\u2019s Mark Parrell. I may need to disassemble, we may not have understood your question. Is that a question about balance sheet sensitivity of us and others to changes in interest rates or our customers\u2019 renewal, I didn\u2019t understand that second part. Ivy Zelman : Well, I guess what I am saying, there is a connection as rates rise, clearly on the transaction side and what the impact is on underwriting assets and whether it\u2019s training or new development, etcetera, but then it also has impact to the competitive markets and how it may be bad players act, so there is the connectivity and I am trying to understand what you think about it broadly and you are forecasting \u201817 your rent growth, revenue growth, AFFO, everything that you are providing to us, how do you think that the rise rate environment impacts the competitive nature of the market as there is some changes in how people act when I think about a good player versus a bad player, do you have that incorporated in your forecast for \u201817? Mark Parrell : Well, I guess what I will tell you, we have incorporated is the LIBOR, the curve that we do that hike. So we assume LIBOR to be higher and we put that into our forecast for our own floating rate debt. The third increase would be so late in the year it wouldn\u2019t be impactful to us. So we thought about that we will comment say that many of our private, most of our private market competitors are much more highly leveraged than we are and carry much more floating rate than we do debt. So to the extent that you are suggesting the competitive landscape changes, if rates go up suddenly and significantly more than people expect and by that I mean short-term rates, that impact will be profound, I would guess as it relates to our private competitors. And considerably less significant to guys like us, we had around worth 10% to 20% floating rate debt. As it relates to our tenant\u2019s actions specifically, I don\u2019t think we factored that into our thoughts. Well, I think what she is asking is \u2013 we will \u2013 like we saw in the South Bay and San Francisco early in 2016, the rational pricing to fill the building up to convert from construction to permanent financing. So I think we have \u2013 that\u2019s why we have created a much wider range in New York on the concession front, because if people do start operating 2, 3, 4 months free to get their building occupied so that they can then go for permanent financing. I think we have that factored into our assumptions or our ranges. Ivy Zelman : Got it. Well good luck guys. Thank you for taking my question. Appreciate it. David Neithercut : Thank you, Ivy. You bet. Operator : And we will take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you and good morning out there. Two questions for you. Maybe they are both for David Santee. Going back to LA, you said that that\u2019s about 40% of your growth for 2017. And then in your commentary, it sounded I was trying to do the math quickly, like maybe half or so, a little over half of your portfolio are in submarkets away from supply, is that correct? And if not, if you could just break it down sort of how much of your LA exposure is in submarkets facing supply like downtown versus submarkets away from supply? David Neithercut : So downtown, which would include, call it, Koreatown, Mid-Wilshire, Hollywood, that\u2019s where half of the supply is. We only have 16% of our total LA MSA across those submarkets. 25% of our revenues sits, let\u2019s just call it, in the Marina or West LA. Over the past year or so, there has been significant new deliveries in the [indiscernible], which has pressured West LA and the Marina. Those submarkets are just beginning to recover. And we would expect little pressure from new supply in \u201817. Other than that, the last major chunk is really Pasadena, where we only have, call it three or four properties. And then \u2013 but we have properties Far East of downtown LA. We have considerable portion of our revenue up in Santa Clarita, up in the San Fernando Valley. So I think we are good in LA as far as feeling the brunt of the concentration of deliveries and loss of pricing power in the urban core. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then switching coast to DC, you mentioned the hiring freeze and how that also covers contractors, but there is also \u2013 trust me, it was a different phone number, if was the wife, I would have to put you guys on hold. Hey, you got to know who the boss is. So, I think you mentioned that hiring is also impact on the contractor side. But if we see defense clearly seems to be getting favored nation status. So if we do see more defense spending, do you think that\u2019s enough to offset the hiring freeze? And then two, how much of your portfolio is Northern Virginia focused out of your DC portfolio? David Neithercut : Well, I guess, what I would say is when you look at the makeup of all of the defense employees in D.C., a lot of them are contractors already. A lot of defense employees are contract employees. So, we kind of look at that as just an offset to not hiring at the EPA or what have you. But we certainly feel that an increased focus on defense spending which is just the biggest piece of the pie in DC will be an overall net benefit. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, thank you. David Neithercut : You are welcome, Alex. Operator : And we will take our next question from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Vincent Chao : Hey, everyone. I just want to go back to the commentary about the trajectory of same-store performance over the course of the year continuing to decelerate. It sounded like if I heard you correctly. And if we think about sort of I know that\u2019s a bottom-up analysis of the markets and whatnot, but if we think about just supply and I think most \u2013 there is a lot of different estimates out there, but most see the first half being worse than the second half. And then also think about the demand side in terms of job growth which has slowed down a bit here, but potentially could reaccelerate towards the back half of the year. I guess, if I think about your trajectory, does that suggest that you don\u2019t expect any change in the job environment or job growth environment, I should say, towards the end of the year and that you are sort of building in more steady supply deliveries? David Santee : I guess, I would say that we don\u2019t \u2013 we are not forecasting any material change to job growth either to the upside or the downside. A lot of the administration\u2019s initiatives are probably more construction type jobs what have you. I mean, everything else remains to be seen. And that\u2019s kind of how we are looking at jobs. I mean, the unemployment rate is low. Mark Parrell : Unemployment rate and college-educated is 2.5%, so\u2026 David Santee : Right. So the unemployment rate and college-educated is 2.5%, so I\u2019m not sure how much more you could improve in the next 12 months, I think it\u2019s just another yet to be seen kind of thing. Vincent Chao : Okay. So that\u2019s the one half and then the supply would be others, so I mean, it does seem like supply should theoretically be easing towards the end, but maybe there is delay in that benefit as those deliveries lease up? But I guess, maybe just another question on the liquidity side or the sources and uses. I thought I heard just under $1 billion of debt repayments planned for the year and then another $300 million of development CapEx, but I thought there was about $400 million of debt planned for issuance and then is the remaining Delta, the CP program that you talked about? David Neithercut : So, some of that will go on the line remember, we do have $250 million to $300 million on cash flow a year and we will have that again this year after all CapEx. So some of that is offset by that. And then the remainder will be a higher line balance at the end of the year or CP depending on what\u2019s kind of more efficient. So, I do expect this to be more like $500 million or $550 million on the revolver CP program towards the end of the year compared to where we are now at couple of hundred. Vincent Chao : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : And we will take our next question from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Drew Babin : Good morning. Quick question on price, you had mentioned before some leases where rents are probably rolling down to market or you have some legacy leases there above market. Could you quantify that in terms of loss to lease for the whole portfolio and more specifically, New York and San Fran, if you can? David Neithercut : Well, I guess, I would say we don\u2019t really focus on loss to lease in a yield management environment. I mean, that number can change dramatically from Q1 to Q2 or Q3, but it\u2019s more about the momentum in the market. So certainly, anyone that moved in prior to, let\u2019s just say, June of last year in San Francisco is probably 5% to 7% above market today. So that\u2019s where you get the roll down until you reach kind of equilibrium on that. Drew Babin : Okay. And secondly, some of the supply data that\u2019s out there suggest that while supply growth looks like it comes down a little bit in \u201818, it\u2019s still elevated relative to \u201816 in New York and so I was hoping I know not all of that likely gets billed, I was hoping you can give us some color on your read on how much of that ultimately gets build on and when \u2013 at what point during this year might those numbers kind of become a little more firm? David Neithercut : Well, I think our \u201817 numbers are firm. I mean in most of our markets that is in our geographic footprint, this is vertical high rise, mid rise product that started 2 years ago. So we again, we reconcile our delivery numbers with axial metric data with our folks in the field, boots on the ground. So I mean I believe we have a very firm handle on what will be delivered in each of our submarkets in 2017. Drew Babin : I am sorry if I said \u201817, actually I meant 2018? David Neithercut : 2018 got to be pretty firm to-date. I mean in order to build these - in order to deliver anything in \u201818, you have got to generally be pretty much underway in New York City. David Santee : You had to be moving there today. David Neithercut : So we do see from a completion standpoint, sort of defining completion, we do see \u201818 in New York a little more than \u201817. But as part of our budgeting process, we recognized that a good amount of that \u201818 will be available for lease, perhaps even in \u201817 and we have accounted for that in our budgeting process. Drew Babin : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much. David Neithercut : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And we will take our next question from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Tayo Okusanya : Yes. Good afternoon everyone. Again, thanks a lot for the details for most of the market. I just had two quick ones, the first one, the $500 million guidance for acquisitions and dispositions again, granted it\u2019s not a big acquisition, disposition year, but could you talk specifically about if all that is opportunistic or if there is anything targeted in any of those numbers? David Santee : Yes, very little. I mean there is almost nothing targeted on that. For some time, we have had just the very, very short list on the acquisition side, but it covers a little bare there at the present time, just given where we see valuations are at the present time relative to wanting to stop, but that we would sell. So I mean that is all I think speculative at this time. If and when we find good trade opportunities to finance that with proceeds from the sale, we will go ahead and do that. But that\u2019s generally been the way we thought about most of that activity even in last year. We had started with an expectation of perhaps selling some to redeploy that would be in addition in a way from the large disposition process. And we did last year, but they were ended up being very little of that activity actually taking place. So we continue to look for products that we can finance that we do think makes sense and the price would makes sense and we believe we can pair that up with appropriate sale, we will go ahead and do that. But we don\u2019t see a lot of that \u2013 we are not working a lot of that at the present time. Tayo Okusanya : Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then the development pipeline, I noticed with the Irvine, California development project, the stabilization date was to start a couple of quarters, any particular reason for that? David Neithercut : Well, that was finally pushed out in response to having pushed out the completion of that some time ago. We had a particularly difficult problem with the general contractor there and nearly maybe suffering from the same sort of labor problems that contractors are suffering with across most of our markets. So the construction, the delivery of that was delayed. There was always a hope that that might not necessarily because you start building two different phases might not necessarily require us to actually change the complete \u2013 the stabilization date. But now we have done so, so that was really response to a several quarter delay during the construction process as a result of general contractor issues. Tayo Okusanya : Great. Thank you. David Neithercut : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Rich Hill : Hey guys, I know we are past hour, a lot of time, so I do want to maybe keep my question short. Going back to your comment that you don\u2019t really have anything to sell, I am sure I am putting words in your mouth, but if the right opportunities came about, you would sell and maybe rotate into something else, could you maybe give us some color just what you would find attractive in the current market, is it would you find New York City attractive, if cap rates widened enough, are you looking for markets with less supply, I am just curious what you would consider to be an attractive acquisition in the current market, if it was favorable enough? David Neithercut : Well, again, it\u2019s attractive relative to that which we want to sell. So I can\u2019t tell you exactly what it might be, but we may find in a market that a reason why we might want to sell in one submarket and redeploy into another submarket or to sell in A and buy B or sell a B. I mean this was a market by market, submarket by submarket exercise, that is a function of what we can sell and where we can redeploy that capital and does that make sense relative to one another. Rich Hill : Understood. But in an ideal theoretical world, I mean obviously, you have some assets that you would potentially sell, what sort of markets do you \u2013 are there any markets that you would specifically be targeting and view more favorably or is it really as dynamic as maybe it seems? David Neithercut : I would not describe that as a market as much as perhaps as specific assets in a market. So there may be assets that we believe might be an opportune time to rollout of today. And I think that\u2019s not market driven, but more asset driven. So older assets, assets which require capital perhaps so we don\u2019t we want to put into it reasons why we want again, as I said earlier move from reduced that exposure in a certain submarket redeploy in another submarket. Just to make it clear, anything that we had really recognized or identified last year as an asset that we knew that was not a long-term hold for us was rolled up into large transaction we executed as part of the $6.8 billion of dispositions last year. So anything that we identified, anything we did not want to own, we tried to and we are successful in putting that in disposing of it a year ago. So anything now, again as assets, we would be willing to sell this, this is not necessarily something that has to be a long-term capability. But we would be willing to sell this if we could find the appropriate acquisition into which we would redeploy that capital. So again, it\u2019s an asset here, an asset there, that we would be willing to sell and we could find the right thing to buy. And again that\u2019s just a trade in, so that\u2019s all a function of the relationship between what we are selling and what you are buying. Rich Hill : Got it, that\u2019s very helpful. So I sort of think about that in terms of just portfolio optimization, you would like the markets that you are in, you believe in them long-term, but from time-to-time, there might be an opportunity to sell one asset and buy another asset and you would take advantage of that if you could? David Neithercut : I wish I have said it so clearly the first time. Rich Hill : Well, thank you, guys. That\u2019s all I have. David Neithercut : You bet. Operator : And we will take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Thanks. Good morning. You discussed spending additional CapEx as a response to new supply and I am wondering if this is market specific or throughout your whole portfolio and also is the $2,600 annual CapEx per unit, is that the new norm for the foreseeable future or just for 2017? Mark Parrell : Yes. It\u2019s Mark Parrell and $2,600, that amount is just really spread throughout the portfolio. There are some larger projects here and there, but it isn\u2019t \u2013 could very over-weighted in one market or another. I did mention in my remarks, we think that $2,600 as an exceptional number and we would expect it to normalize back down to $2,300 or so. So $2,300 a unit is about 7% of our revenue and that\u2019s kind of a number we think is about right and shows very well, relative to a lot of our competitors. This year, it will go up to about 8% of revenue and that\u2019s again, I think our response to competitive pressures and because we got a few low-hanging fruits in some of the sustainability step that we would like to get done. John Kim : And that can be more weighted towards revenue enhancing this year versus last year? Mark Parrell : No, I don\u2019t see it as materially different. I think a lot of the stuff that we call rehabs is revenue enhancing, has a return associated with it, of course some of the replacements are just that. Replacements of worn-out equipment and maybe doesn\u2019t have a specific ROI, but certainly the rehabs of $50 million was all approved at investment committee. Those are all deals that have to meet rigorous hurdles. John Kim : Okay. And then in New York, we have seen a couple of micro-apartment buildings emerge. And I am wondering if you have had any views on this, if you see this as an opportunity, a threat or no impact to your business? David Neithercut : I guess, I would say that supply is supply. Rental supply is rental supply. And if it competes with us, we own some micro apartments in San Francisco and in Seattle and so have some experience with that and sort of understand how it fits into the marketplace, but I don\u2019t look at it as a specific threat. Just new supply is new supply and it competes with us. John Kim : Is that a part of your portfolio that you maybe willing to grow? David Neithercut : Again, as it makes sense, it\u2019s a very high turnover product and so it does require sort of a little bit different sort of management, but we wouldn\u2019t steer clear of it, but we are not \u2013 it\u2019s not part of a specific strategy to grow at the present time. John Kim : Great, thank you. David Neithercut : You bet. Operator : And we will take our next question from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay : Good morning, guys. Looking at your base case for demand in New York, are you assuming more of the same financial service jobs contracting flattish information jobs? David Neithercut : Yes. Wes Golladay : Okay. And then you have kind of mentioned rising wages to limit employee turnover. Are you seeing an uptick in turnover? And is there any property level impact when this happens? David Santee : We do our best to retain our employees and there is many levers, benefits, enhanced department discounts what have you. There are a lot of team managers out there that don\u2019t necessarily have skin in the game when it comes to offering wages. And we have seen some how we call them outrageous offers to some people. But for the most part, I think, a lot of our people that work at Equity Residential are very loyal. And what we do see are people leaving for simply more opportunity. The good performers that when you are adding 30,000 units over a couple of years in New York City that creates a lot of new property manager jobs, regional manager jobs and what have you, but we don\u2019t see people leaving for lateral opportunities. Wes Golladay : Okay. And then last one, have you mentioned where new and renewal leases are going out at, for January and for the next few months on renewals? Mark Parrell : No, I have not, but I can. For January, we achieved 4.2% on renewals. February, which is almost closed out, 85% are closed out, we achieved 4.2%. And then March, 60%, we still have 50% to be worked, and we are at a 3.9%. Wes Golladay : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : And we will take our next question from Tom Lesnick with Capital One. Tom Lesnick : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I will keep it short since we are pretty late in the call here. Bigger picture and I know it\u2019s early into the new administration everything. But given immigration policy and everything, have you guys looked at migration trends and how that sensitivity applies to your various markets? Is there some sort of demand elasticity that is sharper in some of your markets more than others? Just wondering if you could comment on maybe San Francisco, LA and New York specifically? David Santee : So, we have begun to dig into our database. We don\u2019t identify the people on visas specifically. But there are other ways that we can query folks with no Social Security numbers or kind of an obvious first run. I would tell you that we are not ready to commit to any numbers. But I think what we have seen so far plays out matches up with our thinking in that Boston and San Francisco are very similar for different reasons, right? So San Francisco is more H1B visa. Boston is more international students. New York is probably in between those two places. So once we validate what we are seeing, we would be in a better position to kind of talk about that next quarter. Tom Lesnick : Okay, thanks for the call. I appreciate it. David Neithercut : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And we will take our last question from Nick Joseph with Citi. Michael Bilerman : Hey, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman with Nick. So we spent a lot of time talking about I guess the outputs of your guidance. I am curious into the methodology, the process, the inputs that you used to kind of come up with it. And obviously after last year\u2019s guidance, perhaps, part of it was you are going to delay a quarter which you did. And I think you sort of earmarked a little bit that you are going to come up with a larger range. So how did the process, how did the methodology, how should we think about the guidance you have put out relative to your guidance that you had done last year? David Neithercut : Well, I think when you look at 2016 we went into the woods unprepared. We thought \u2013 we assumed 2016 was going to be a repeat of 2015 and we didn\u2019t allocate the appropriate tools for a significant market downturn like we had in San Francisco. Also, San Francisco made up a very large percentage of our growth. So, the biggest market that contributed to growth at the most significant downturn in a very short period of time. And I think looking back that whether it\u2019s Axiometrics or any other shop, I think people acknowledge that San Francisco went south much quicker and much harder than even those folks expected. So this year, we have given ourselves obviously a bigger range. We \u2013 obviously, 2017 is going to be elevated supply, unlike \u201815 that had tremendous job growth and you packed in 1.5 year worth of growth into 1 year. So, I think we started from the ground up, looked at our trends on new lease, our lease-over-lease growth made our assumptions on rental rate increases in each of the markets relative to supply and job growth and how those flow through the year quarter-by-quarter. And I think we have developed reasonable ranges that cover some potential upside as well as looking where the volatility \u2013 most of the volatility is like New York and covering ourselves on the downside. Michael Bilerman : Okay. And was there sort of top once you did all your bottoms up analysis and additional conservatism baked in top-down in your model? I guess I am just trying to really grasp how conservative you have put out this guidance knowing what happened last year? I just didn\u2019t know if there was any sort of methodology changes or data input changes that would lead to a different outcome? David Santee : No. I mean, we did a sensitivity analysis market by market. We know there is a 50 basis point increase or decrease in revenue what that does to the whole company. And I think we have created the appropriate ranges given the expected activity in the market that gets you to our midpoint. Michael Bilerman : And then so the streets got your NAV at $70 stocks, hovering around $60, so call it 14% or 15% discount, double to the discount of to where your apartment peers trade, you have a 13 million share authorization, call it $800 million or so, why wouldn\u2019t you be buying your stock today? Mark Parrell : We have been using free cash flow Michael, as you know, to complete what has been a very successful development work. We are bringing that down and that creates capacity to perhaps do as you suggest as we get through the development that needs to be completed this year. Like I have said repeatedly on these calls that share repurchases are certainly part of what we will consider. We have bought stock back in the past and we will not be afraid to buy stock back in the future. We got limited bites at the apple and when you do, you would need to make it count and we will make sure that if and when we do it, it\u2019s at the right time. Michael Bilerman : But I guess your stock is hovering around the levels \u2013 the low levels of the last number of months, I am trying to get a sense of whether that\u2019s \u2013 you know your capital needs are, you can certainly lever up knowing that you are going to have the free cash flow next year, whether this is an attractive enough entry point or do you not sort of see the same discount that the street is seeing? Mark Parrell : We see the same discount as the street is seeing. I mean nobody is more aware of that than we are this management team and our Board. And when we act, we will let you know. But we won\u2019t \u2013 no need I think to say anything in advance of that activity. Michael Bilerman : Correct, okay. Thank you, gentlemen. David Neithercut : You\u2019re very welcome. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. David Neithercut : Thank you all for your time. We appreciate it and have a long day and we appreciate your tolerance with us today. We will see you all around the circuit. Thank you very much. Operator : And that concludes today\u2019s presentation. We thank you, all for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead. Marty McKenna : Thanks, Chris. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential\u2019s first quarter 2017 results. Our featured speakers today are David Neithercut, our President and CEO; David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Parrell, our Chief Financial Officer. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. And now I will turn it over to David Neithercut. David Neithercut : Thank you, Marty. Good morning everybody and thank you for joining us for today's call. As you will hear in just a moment from David Santee and Mark Parrell, the first quarter came in pretty much in line with our expectations. Occupancy remained quite high, particularly on a seasonal basis, clearly demonstrating the continued strong demand for rental housing in our core markets. And we saw retention improve over the first quarter of last year while achieving renewal rates of 4.3%, clearly demonstrating the benefits of remarkable customer service and the dedication of our teams across the country. As expected, new apartment supply continues to pressure new lease rates, causing our portfolio to produce negative lease over lease growth in the first quarter. Fortunately, the apartment demand is proving sufficiently strong to absorb this new supply while maintaining healthy occupancy levels in existing assets across our market. In fact, our own lease up activity in southern California, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington DC is going exceptionally well where we are leasing units with a pace well above our original expectations and net effective rents are generally at or above what we had originally projected. I will let David Santee go into more detail about how our markets performed in the first quarter and where we sit today going into the extremely important leasing season, and then Mark Parrell will give some color on operating expenses. David? David Santee : Okay. Thank you, David, and good morning everyone. I want to spend a few minutes reviewing our performance across our markets and our positioning as we head into the primary leasing season. Our goal in 2017 is to focus on retaining our existing residents to drive the new lease growth and thus far our teams have delivered. Meeting with the local teams and making sure that we all understand the dynamics in every market is crucial for how we run our business and I spend a great deal of my time with the properties for that reason. Over the past several months, my senior team and I have travelled to all of our markets for meetings that included everyone of our employees in each market to ensure that our highly collaborative team members understand our strategy and tactics. As part of these meetings, our sales folks and managers attended an in-depth renewal negotiation workshop focusing on sharing best practices in order to better feel prepared in the coming months. Our reported Q1 results leave us well positioned as we enter the early stages of our peak leasing season. We are pleased with how the quarter played out, given the elevated deliveries across many of our markets. Our revenue growth of 2.6% was driven by pure rate growth as renewal rates achieved for the quarter were 4.3%. More importantly, the percentage of our residents who renewed with us increased from 57% in Q1 of '16 to 60% for this quarter. And this was on a pool of units up for renewal that is about 3% larger than last year. Already, we are seeing good results as our renewal rates achieved in both April and May are up 4.7%. As David said in his remarks, this is a great indicator of the terrific work being done by our teams across the portfolio. Now while renewal rates achieved thus far are encouraging, the peak leasing season has many potential risks, either through elevated supply or uncertainty in part of the economy. We know that summers lag around the corner and following the expected normal seasonal pattern, inventories will be begin to build and occupancies will start to moderate. Our team will continue to work hard, lease by lease, to deliver for our shareholders. Now moving on to the market, I will give you some color on what we are experiencing today and describe where we are on the delivery cycle for new units. Additionally, I will provide a renewal and lease over lease results for the quarter as well as provide color on our average net effective new lease pricing. And just to clarify, our lease over lease results are the net change when we compare old lease rents to new move-in rents for the same unit. These results are influenced by the old rent as well as the term of the previous lease and are not always indicative of current market conditions, especially early in the year. Our net effective new lease prices better represent the year-over-year trend in a market and are the prices the customer uses in making their leasing decisions. So starting with Seattle. Renewals achieved for the quarter were up 7.1% and lease over lease results were up 4.1%. Both well within expectations for the quarter. Net effective new lease pricing was strong and has averaged approximately up 7% versus the same quarter last year. Both rate growth and occupancy for the quarter was good and demand remains healthy. And while a greater percentage of the new deliveries will occur in the back half of the year, we continue to expect Seattle to be our top performing market for the full year. At Amazon alone, the open positions numbered within 9000 jobs, many of which are high paying and the recent news of the Boeing layoffs and overall downsizing in their engineering function, specifically in Seattle, should have minimal impact to our portfolio as we have minimal exposure north of town. San Francisco has been stable thus far despite the level of new deliveries that are heavily weighted in the first half of the year. Renewal rates achieved in the quarter were up 3.9%, lease over lease results were negative with 1.7%. Net effective new lease pricing growth was up 2% throughout the quarter and remain at that level. Tech job growth remains muted in San Francisco but there is growth. [DC] [ph] investments appears to have bottomed in Q4 of 2016 and maybe improving. With new apartment deliveries more dispersed across the [indiscernible] than in 2016, we believe that San Francisco should be better positioned this year to absorb these deliveries in a rational manner. Southern California, which makes up about 26% of our total NOI and is expected to deliver nearly 60% of our total revenue growth in 2017, is on track. Orange County in San Diego are leading the way with plus 5% revenue growth for the quarter. LA is feeling the effects of peak deliveries in Q1 while Orange County will see peak deliveries in the back half of the year. As expected, the far north and east LA submarkets are very strong as most of the new supply is concentrated in the urban core and closer in submarkets like Pasadena and Korea Town. Renewal rates achieved for LA were plus 5.7% for the quarter and lease over lease results were positive 60 basis points. Net effective new lease pricing growth averaged just under 12% versus same quarter last year. Orange County and San Diego achieved 6.6% and 5.2% renewal rate growth respectively and lease over lease results were up 1.7% and 60 basis points respectively. Net effective new lease pricing remains at expected levels as we enter the [indiscernible] months of peak demand and average 5% for Orange County and San Diego combined. April renewals results for the three markets are showing seasonal strength with LA achieving growth of 7.1% and Orange County and San Diego achieving growth of 6.7% and 6.3% respectively. So moving over to East Coast and Boston. Most of the Q1 revenue growth was driven by 110 basis point improvement in [indiscernible], as quarter over quarter turnover declined by 260 basis points with fever deliveries pressuring the market then we experienced in the second half of 2016. Renewal rate increases achieved for the quarter were 3.7% and lease over lease results were negative 5.4% and in line with our original forecast. Net effective new lease pricing increased in average of 2.5% for the quarter. With peak deliveries reoccurring in the urban core in Cambridge in Q2 of this year, we expect Boston to perform to expectations for the balance of the year. However, Boston has always been greatly influenced by the high percentage of students, especially in the urban core. With the uncertainty around current immigration policy and the strength of the dollar, we are playing close attention to demand from international students as we began the student season churn. In Boston, our renewal rate growth achieved thus far for April and May our 3.4% and 4.6%, with less than 16% of May renewal offers still open. Net effective new lease rents remain positive but are moderating as inventory is growing as students get there notices to vacate and new deliveries open their doors. New York has remained disciplined thus far considering that more than 10,000 new units are currently in lease-up in the market. Half of these units were delivered in 2016 and the other half delivered in Q1 of this year. Deliveries will continue to grow throughout the year peaking in Q3. Upfront move-in concessions were basically the same in Q1 of 2017 versus 2016 and net effective new lease pricing, and that includes concessions, continued to hold, down only 1% versus same period last year but on an expected lower occupancy. It's no surprise that Brooklyn and the West side are under the most pricing pressure as the largest amount of due deliveries are occurring in these submarkets. On the flip side the East side and Jersey Waterfront are still delivering positive revenue growth approaching 2%. Renewal rates achieved in New York for the quarter were positive 2.3% and lease over lease results were negative 6.2%, both of which are modestly below our expectations. Net effective new lease pricing has averaged negative 1% for the quarter. April renewal rates achieved came in at 1.7% while May results are currently 2.7%, with only 9% of offers still outstanding. Given that the growth in higher-paying jobs is weaker than one would hope and the market continues to see elevated deliveries, we are pleased by the pricing discipline that we have seen in the market thus far. Across the board concessions appeared to be limited to lease-ups as standard operating procedure, while stabilized community concessions are very targeted based on unit price exposure. For instance for the quarter, our move-in concessions averaged $575 per move-in are about 4.5 days of free rent per move-in. Washington DC has performed to expectations despite modestly depressed demand due to the federal hiring freeze and uncertainty about the future of many government agencies. Renewal rates achieved were up 4.1%, lease over lease results were minus 4% which was slightly below our expectations but mitigated with an increase in occupancy. Net effective new lease pricing averaged up 2% for the quarter. April renewals which are essentially close delivered 4.5% rate growth, and in May with only a few renewals open, we are achieving 5% growth. Given the political uncertainties and new deliveries that are extremely weighted in the first half of the year, we would expect the softness in the net effective new lease pricing to remain under pressure for most of the peak season but offset by improving renewal increases as the back half of the year would see a sharp fall off in new deliveries. So the theme for us in 2017 is renewals. It's about working hard to keep our current residents happy with their choice and more importantly, keeping them living in an EQR community. And so we have taken the time to strengthen the skills that our employees need to meet the challenges of elevated supply. As a person who began his career as an assistant manager of a 1500 unit property in Washington DC, I never forget the challenges that our people face. In no other industry does your customer live with you 24x7, 365. I would like to thank all of our employees for what you do each and every day. I am inspired by your spirit, always motivated by your energy and humbled by your commitment to excellence at Equity Residential. Mark Parrell : Thank you, David. It's Mark Parrell. I want to take a few minutes this morning to discuss same store expenses. Our same store expense growth of 3.9% in the first quarter was primarily driven by increases in real estate taxes, on-site payroll and repairs and maintenance. This was slightly higher than we expected due to the impact of the California storm cost that I'm going to go over in a moment. So here is some quick color on some of the bigger expense line items. We saw a 4.2% increase in real estate taxes driven by assessment increases in Boston and Seattle. Also the burn off of 421(a) tax abatements in New York added 1.8 percentage points to this quarter's number. For the full-year we continue to expect real estate taxes which make up about 42% of our total operating expenses, increase between 4% and 5%. Moving on to on-site payroll. These expenses increased to 4.6% in the first quarter. For the full-year we continue to expect an increase of between 4% and 5% as we face the higher property level wage climate with our employees in high demand in a very competitive market. And David Santee just mentioned our laser focus on renewals and as a result of that, we have also added staff in some markets to provide even better service to our residents and to support tenant retention. Payroll expense this quarter was also impacted by the California storms as our property staffs worked longer hours addressing storm damage. Now I'm going to turn to repairs and maintenance where we saw a 6.7% increase in that line item in this quarter. As you saw on the news, mother nature made up for several years of severe drought in California with heavy and consistent rains which resulted in increased roof repairs, tree trimming and similar costs. These costs totaled approximately $570,000 in the first quarter which drove this number up to 6.7% from about 3.7%. Now on to a less material expense line item, leasing and advertising expense, which in the quarter increased to 12%. The increase in the quarter was driven by increased resident referral fees, including broker fees and more spending on resident activities to keep our customers engaged. These expenditures were generally all budgeted and expected. Last year, we reported an increase in this line item due to promotional spending, including the use of resident gift cards primarily in New York. We have budgeted about $700,000 in gift card spending in 2017 but thus far card use has been minimal. We still expect leasing and advertising expense for the full-year 2017 to be flat compared to 2016. I will now turn the call over to David Neithercut. David Neithercut : Thanks, Mark. On our last call, we indicated that following the year in which we sold nearly $7 billion of assets that 2017 would look quite tame on the capital allocation front and that we would transact if and when we found an opportunity to redeploy disposition proceeds into a higher pool of return asset. That remains the case. Although the one asset we did sell in the first quarter was a sold over from last year. This was a 304 unit asset built in 1970 and located in Milford, Massachusetts. For the handful of you that don\u2019t know where north of Massachusetts is, that\u2019s about 40 miles west of Boston. This leaves us with one remaining asset left to sell, also an older property in Massachusetts, in Franklin, Massachusetts, also well west of Boston. And those are just significant as a holdover from the large portfolio that we undertook to sell in 2016. Although we did not acquire anything in the first quarter, guidance for the full-year continue to assume $500 million of acquisition activity funded by a light amount of disposition activity at a negative spread of 75 basis points. We are underwriting a handful of possible acquisitions at the present time that we think would make great new investment opportunities for us but only at the right price. It remains to be seen where these deals will actually trade. We will continue to hang around the hook, ready to play if it makes sense to do so and track the potential opportunities as they occur throughout the balance of the year. So with all that said, Chris, we will be happy to open up the call to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Nick Joseph of Citi. Nick Joseph : In terms of same store revenue guidance, would you Mark, consider keep an eye on the most volatility that would either result in you ending up towards the high end of same store revenue guidance or towards the bottom end? David Santee : This is David Santee. Given that Southern California is going to deliver almost 50% of our expected growth for 2017, we are obviously laser focused on the results coming out of those markets. Nick Joseph : Thanks. And then you mentioned the lower turnover. What do you attribute that to? Is it something that you are doing from a strategy perspective or is it something that you think is happening across the markets overall? David Santee : Well, I think if you just look at our industry, I think there is an overarching trend that residents are just more confident in the future. There was a Freddie Mac study that said people are staying longer. I think we have seen that over the past years. People just like where they live. They don\u2019t want to move from their lifestyle. Most of these communities are not two-storey walk-ups. They are much less transient. And I think we are seeing the benefits of that. David Neithercut : I think residents, Nick, they get comfortable with the staff. We create essential family and neighborhood in the building. They grow accustomed to the amenities that are nearby and their inclination and desire is to stay. We do everything we can to do encourage them to do that and we are very pleased with the results that the team is delivering out there. Operator : We will take our next question from Rich Hightower of Evercore. Rich Hightower : So I am going to start with a question on expenses. Just to make sure that I have got this correct. I am having trouble squaring, I think, the couple of statements that real estate taxes and payroll, which are the two biggest expense categories. I think you said you are going to grow 4% to 5% for the balance of the year and I just want to square that against the 3% to 4% expense guidance which was unchanged after the first quarter results. Mark Parrell : Yes. It's Mark. It's 4% to 5% for the whole year for those two line items. For payroll it's 4% to 5% for the annual expense number, and it's 4% to 5% for property taxes for the whole year. Rich Hightower : Okay. Thanks, Mark. I guess that begs the same question though. I mean if the two largest expense categories are growing greater than the guidance range, where do you make up for it on the other side, I guess, is the question. Mark Parrell : Well, for the utilities, which we see as pretty low number in the 1% to 2% range and it's 14% of our expenses, is one of the line items where we are going to see a benefit. Rich Hightower : Okay. That helps. Second question from me. This goes back to what David Santee referred to in the prepared comments. There was a comment about sharing best practices. It sounded like on the revenue management side of things, in the face of new supply and maybe changing the game plan a little bit versus what happened in 2016. I am just wondering if you can provide a little more color as to what some of those specifics might be going forward. David Santee : Well, I don\u2019t know that we are changing our game plan. This is more about, a lot of our leasing folks, these are entry level positions, it's probably the highest turnover position in our industry. And it's just included as we enter the peak leasing season each year. The fact that we had a sales meeting before peak leasing season is not necessarily new. We do this every year. What is new is the fact that myself, our senior leaders here, we went out, we spent time with these folks. We heard their concerns. We discussed our opportunities, especially with our service employees. They are a critical piece of the renewal puzzle and this was all about giving them the support they need to be as successful as they can over the next several months. Operator : From UBS, we go next to Nick Yulico. Nick Yulico : First, I guess, on New York. Obviously, a lot of concern with all the supply that\u2019s coming. Can you give us a sense for now much of your portfolio in New York you think is actually exposed to the high, luxury segment of the market where all the supply is being delivered. David Santee : Well, I guess I would say probably most of it. The question that we have always -- that will be answered soon is will Long Island City become a new value destination and will that draw folks from Manhattan or Brooklyn in search of a lower rent. It's probably easier to talk about lower to least exposed, which is probably Jersey City, and the upper east side. But the bulk of our revenue comes from -- well, over 30% of our revenue is just on the West side. So that will, and that\u2019s where most of the deliveries that will directly compete with our portfolios are coming on line. Nick Yulico : Okay. And then, David Neithercut, I had a question on you and the board's capital allocation views right now. So in March, I think, you are doing your annual NAV analysis to the board. I am wondering what the conclusion of that analysis was and specifically how you are weighing external growth versus buying back your stock. David Neithercut : Well, we talk about this on a quarterly, at the board level, and we have for quite some time I think taken a more cautious approach with respect to capital allocation. As you know, we throttled back our development considerably and following the large disposition that we did last year and even last year we did not acquire a great deal. For the past several years our free cash flow has gone to fund our development pipeline which has been extremely profitable and successful pipeline. That has been communicated with our board in our most recent meeting but that spend will begin to reduce and beginning in '18, you know that commitment to that business will not be at the magnitude that it had been over the past few years and that capital could be used for many different uses, including stock buyback, if we thought that was appropriate to do at that time. Nick Yulico : Okay. I guess just a follow-up. Are you also thinking about other options, maybe to free up some more capital. Whether it be selling some of the recent New York City developments or maybe even raising your leverage a bit, sacrificing your A minus credit rating. Because you are, maybe not getting that much of a benefit from it right now versus if you went down a notch. I mean how do you think about some of those approaches which would create even more capital to reinvest somewhere else. David Neithercut : Well, I mean we did sell an awful lot of assets last year and did return a significant amount of capital to our shareholders. So it's not as though we have not been thinking about that kind of thing. In terms of selling assets, we believe that many of the assets that have been recent developments really will be the value creators for the company over an extended time period. Assets that may not be as important to the long-term strategy of the company as demonstrated by that which we sold last year and the meaningful gains they will produce, because of the requirement of distributing those gains that produce a lot of excess cash flow. We have, as you note, our balance sheet is probably in the best shape that it's ever been. Mark and his team has spend a lot of team with the agency getting to know about what we have been doing there and that number has come down. And we have communicated to that side of the investment community that we are not unwilling to use that capacity if and when it makes sense to do so. We fit in the ranges in the bottom [indiscernible] in which we have operated since we went public back in 1993. So I guess I would tell you that we have had these discussions and we will not be afraid to use that capacity if and when it makes sense to do so. Operator : Our next question comes from Conor Wagner of Green Street Advisors. Conor Wagner : David Santee, can you tell us where San Francisco renewals are for April and May? David Santee : Yes, I can. I think said those in the prepared remarks. San Francisco for April 4.8%, and May still has about 42% to be worked so it's 4.2%, so that number should close May much higher. Conor Wagner : Okay. And then what's your positioning on renewal offers for June. Are you guys looking to raise them or hold them to where, probably not just in San Francisco, to where you have been sending them out for May. David Santee : Well, so a lot of the West Coast markets are on our 30-day notice requirement markets. So we haven't issued many of those renewals yet. But I can tell you, on the East Coast where we have to issue those about 75 days in advance, those are, let's [indiscernible] on par with May. Conor Wagner : Okay. And then I don\u2019t if you mentioned, David Santee, in your prepared remarks, the portfolio-wide lease over lease growth for 1Q? On the new renewal growth. David Santee : The lease over lease, that is minus 2%. Conor Wagner : Minus 2%. Okay. Thank you. And then David Neithercut, in the transaction market we have observed a slowdown in total transactions in recent months. I don\u2019t know if you have seen the same thing, I assume so, and then what you would attribute this to or any difference you have seen either as a seller or as a buyer on your counterparties behavior? David Neithercut : Well, I think you have seen and everyone has sort of seen, it's just a widening of the bid ask spread, which is not, shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise, when there is some question about where interest rates are going, where you are seeing some of the softness on the new leasing and this new supply. So you continue to have owners and sellers who think the properties are worth a certain price and you have got buyers sort of saying I am not so sure. So there has been a slowdown of transaction activity for quite some time and certainly we have seen very little in the first quarter away from value added product for which the remaining is a fairly good bid. Operator : And we will go next to Juan Sanabria of Bank of America. Juan Sanabria : Just a quick question on the job growth on the West Coast, in particular Southern California, given its importance to your growth. What are you guys seeing on the grounds in terms of job growth creation, both there, maybe if you can comment on kind of what you are seeing in Northern California as well? Do you see signs of improvement or more softening that you had expected when you set guidance earlier in the year. David Santee : I guess I wouldn\u2019t categorize it either way. I mean it's kind of where we thought it would be. I think the better news for LA specifically is that the number of high paying jobs that are being created are in the places where we are developing new apartments, specifically the urban core. But LA has always been very broad-based, many product types, many different municipalities. So I think it's too soon to say anything either way as we are on track and we will meet the expectations. Juan Sanabria : Okay. And then do you guys have a view on how the investment community should be thinking about the permitting numbers, like the latest month data in March, trailing 12-months was up over 20%. Do you see that as a risk to the expectation that supply would come down at some point in '18 and '19? David Neithercut : Our expectations are notwithstanding recent permits. Based upon the intelligence that we gather from our teams with boots on the ground in the markets in which we operate suggest that generally '17 will be a peak and that we will see new supply reduce from there. We are certainly aware of the permitting activity. We know historically, 85% or so percent of those trends are [starts] [ph] etcetera. But our belief is with land pricings where they are, with construction financing becoming more difficult to get, with the new supply that\u2019s coming into the marketplaces today, we just continue to believe that we should see new supply come down from this peak level that we are going to experience in 2017. By definition, if 85% or so conversion of permits in the starts, that means there is some things that must be left. You know I don\u2019t know what the range is, what the dispersion is around that number but I certainly would believe that there would have to be years in which it would be below 85% and certainly would expect that number to [indiscernible]. Our guidance is around, we are looking at everything. Any of the [indiscernible], any of the players. Mark Parrell, I would ask him to just jump in. Well, he has been on the finance side, what he is sort of seeing and hearing about the debt side. But between land prices, construction costs continue to go up, the challenges that the markets are seeing would result in reducing supply and sort of compressing rent growth. Just making it become even more challenging to sort of pencil and we don\u2019t see any reason why we shouldn\u2019t come down from the 2017 peak. Mark Parrell : And just on the development financing side, I mean we are constantly following banks, talking to loan brokers, talking to developers that are out there in the private market. And it certainly was an inflection point back in December of '15 when the bank regulator issued its letter. There is a pretty significant view from the banks at that point that they weren't going to increase their partner lending. So what we think is going in the apartment lending generally is that spreads are higher, 300 or so over LIBOR is pretty common. That advanced rates moderated in to the 60%-65% advance rate. So you need to come up with a good amount of equity. And thus all the things that David Neithercut mentioned about higher land cost, higher construction cost coming to play and just make the deal harder to pencil for what is now a pretty big size equity check that needs to be written. Now with the bank financing market is allowing though is as these deals roll off, so in other words become stabilized and are often refinanced with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, that does create capacity at these banks to re-up and to do loans. So we don\u2019t see precipitous declines, to be honest, in bank volume as a whole. We don\u2019t see it going up either as it relates to apartment lending and over time we think that will cause the moderation that David referred to. Juan Sanabria : Okay. Great. And then one last one from me. How should we expect occupancy to trend for the balance of the year? David Santee : This is David Santee. I think we expect, I think I have mentioned that in my prepared remarks, we would expect occupancy to kind of begin to moderate a little bit through the summer months, just due to the level of activity. And then steady off in Q4 that will follow a normal seasonal pattern. There is still good demand. We don\u2019t see any really material changes expected. Operator : And from Morgan Stanley, we will go next to Rich Hill. Rich Hill : I wanted to get a little bit more questions on maybe New York City. So on new leases, I think you commented new leases were down negative 6%. Curious if you just maybe give us some look as to what you think the glide path might look like, sort of given what seems to be some new supply. So said in other words, when do you really start to see that to stabilize. David Santee : Well, I guess I would say that peak deliveries in New York are most likely to occur next year. So 15,000 units this year of which only five have been delivered. And then another 17,000 units next year. So that\u2019s kind of, we have kind of the deliveries mapped out on a graph and for this year those deliveries peak in Q3. But, again, some of the deliveries in Q4 will obviously carryover into '18 as well. So I think David said in his prepared remarks, looking at new lease prices, they will probably continue to be under pressure, but on the other hand these lease over lease numbers that I quote, I mean more often than not they are always negative. It's just one of those nuances in our business. And what's not factored in that number are the fees. Most of these people that move in November, December or January, February. These are people that are forced to move. These people are the people that typically have to early term their lease. We are charging significant fees for the privilege of doing that. And those do not show up in these lease over lease numbers. David Neithercut : And to just expand on that a little bit. So we know that lease rates moderate through the year, so I mean if someone leases his unit from us in July, August, and as David said, needs to vacate in the first quarter, we will lease that at a lower number and we expect that rate rather to be a lower number. Which is why as he says, often times first quarter lease over lease is going to be negative. Now because of this new supply, it's probably more negative today than it would otherwise be. But I don\u2019t want people to -- we want people to understand that it's even in an upward market it's not uncommon for there to be negative lease over lease in the first quarter. Rich Hill : Got it. So maybe a little bit of improvement as we go towards, as we progress through the year? David Neithercut : Because the market rates will increase as we get in the primary leasing season, yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Tayo Okusanya : Congrats on the quarter. I know it's a very tough backdrop but the execution looks pretty good. Quick two questions from my end. The first one is, 1Q is a seasonally slower quarter. You still put up, same store NOI growth above your guidance or 0% to 2%. From your comments today it sounds like things are incrementally getting better. So I am just curious why maintain the guidance of zero to 2% for same store NOI growth in 2017? Kind of what are you expecting in the back half of the year that could be negatively impacting that number. David Neithercut : Let me just start by, sort of you have answered your question I think when asking it. And that is, transaction activities accrued up to now were just now getting into the primary leasing season and when the rubber meets the road. So we are trying to give you a sense of what we have seen in the first quarter but as David said, David Santee said in his prepared remarks, we recognize that the heavy lifting is yet ahead of us. Operator : John Kim from BMO Capital Markets is our next question. John Kim : Recognizing that this is the peak year of supplies in your market except New York, can you provide some color on where you think supply will be in 2018 versus 2016. David Neithercut : Sure. Basically these are numbers which as of today most likely will be built because if you are vertical, you are already moving there. So we are looking at across all of our markets, about 54,100 units. John Kim : So is that higher or lower than last year? David Santee : For '18 that will be lower than this year '17. David Neithercut : The question was, how does that compare to '16? David Santee : '16, I don\u2019t have --. John Kim : Okay. David Neithercut : John, [indiscernible] I mean it\u2019s [200,000] [ph] plus in '17. One thing to just think about this supply, when it gets delivered is at a point in time it takes a lot of leasing up. So even '16 deliveries are complication for us today and '17 deliveries will be complication in '18. I know there would be fewer deliveries in '18 than in '17. So we are watching very closely, as I said earlier, we have got our guys, our investment officers, development folks, our management people on the ground. They are on track on all the stuff. And when David gives you that number, so I make it clear, that this is the number of supply that we are looking at within sort of the markets that we draw, that we believe to be competitive with our product. That was not intended to be a number for the entire marketplace but only that which we believe there is product that would be competitive with our portfolio set. John Kim : Okay. Great. Thanks. I have a question now on your utilization of two-year lease terms. Are there certain markets we are using this more. And how much growth do you typically bake in to that second year of lease term, if any. David Santee : So I would say really the only place where we are using two-year leases are primarily in New York. We are obligated to offer two-year leases and I think our belief was that we have done thus far year-to-date, it's about 15% of total move-ins. Again, we very low volume in the quarters, so 15% of a very low number is again a very low number. So it's not a material part of our leasing strategy. John Kim : And is that second year typically flat or is there growth in that second year? David Santee : I would tell you that in experimenting obviously we have had more takers when there is no increase built-in, but depending upon what we expect as far as deliveries in 2018, we may offer two-year leases with no increase built-in. Operator : We will go next to Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Alexander Goldfarb : Two questions for us. First, on the last call you guys mentioned the CapEx and the need to obviously be more competitive with the new supply. Have you guys sort of qualified how much you think your CapEx spending could change and I am not just talking sort of light apartment upgrades but sort of to make those properties as competitive as they can be with new supply. Have you guys sort of quantified what you think it's going to be over the next few years versus your historic run rate, especially as you commented, focus on turnover and keeping tenants in place versus having them jump for better deals elsewhere. David Santee : So Alex, we had talked in the last call about a number as a percentage of revenue for the same store set of around 7% for all CapEx spending where rehabs replacements were all shooting match. This year we are into low 8% range. Again, talking to the team it seems like 7%, 7.5%, somewhere in that range is the right number for us. So that equates to about $2,300 per unit versus the $2,600 we are spending this year. So, again, from our point of view, we don\u2019t feel like our assets have a great deal of deferred maintenance such that we require some sort of catch up. But we are trying to make our assets just a little bit more [indiscernible] accelerating some things we would have done in out years to this year to make the leasing season all the bit better for us right now. So I guess I don\u2019t feel like the run rate has changed past this year. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then maybe for David Santee, can you just give us your thoughts now that the 421(a) discussion is sort of coming out. It would seem from a quick read that its, from Manhattan and the trendy parts of Brooklyn, the new 421(a) is probably not helpful and may actually be positive for existing landlords as far as restricting supply just given the terms. But I am sure you guys are much closer to it. So can you just give your thoughts as far as it pertains to your Manhattan and Brooklyn portfolio, how you think the new 421(a) -- if you think it will encourage development or because of the terms it won't actually add to development necessarily. David Neithercut : It's David Neithercut. We have concurred with your conclusion. Our team in New York has underwritten some transactions and applied the new affordable New York to those and their takeaway that while there are some nuances between the two, there is not really a dramatic change from the private programs. We think that the, to your point, that the big condo land in New York City and all and the rising construction cost would continue to make Manhattan and the Brooklyn markets that you mention, very restrictive for new apartments going forward and that this affordable New York program will likely promote and encourage some rentals but that is more in the outer boroughs. But we do not see it as something that\u2019s going to have a meaningful impact on bringing new development into the Manhattan and of course in Brooklyn markets. Operator : And our next question comes from Tom Lesnick of Capital One. Tom Lesnick : I guess, first following on those comments about why New York, particularly increasing next year. Can you comment on the makeup of that supply, and by that I mean should we see a shift from Manhattan to the boroughs in New Jersey? And in turn does that mean less direct supply for you, the bulk of your products in Manhattan proper. David Santee : This is David Santee. I have kind of misplaced my New York delivery. But regardless, there is no hold on of supply in Jersey City or East Manhattan. I mean a lot of the supply this year and next will be centered in kind of Northeast Brooklyn, Long Island City, continuing the upper Westside, the Westside, and then a smattering of midtown down to lower Manhattan. I mean that\u2019s where all of the development is located both this year and next. Tom Lesnick : Okay. So you are not seeing a concentration shift of any kind? David Santee : No. I mean, concentration -- have to define them. When Long Island City is only train stop away, we will have to wait and see if that\u2019s a drawl out of Manhattan. So there is some jockeying around. There is obviously less neighborhood loyalty, so to speak, and probably what we were accustomed to five to ten years ago. We hear stories of people moving from lower Manhattan over to Jersey City. We see people moving from Jersey City to upper Westside. And really it just comes down to what lifestyle are you trying to achieve. Tom Lesnick : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then, I guess secondly, thanks for mentioning the occupancy cadence expectations for the remainder of the year. I was just wondering if you guys could comment on the cadence of same store growth quarter by quarter for the year as well and perhaps the revenue and expense components as well. Mark Parrell : Hey, Tom. We don\u2019t quarter by quarter same store revenue numbers. Generally speaking, the number will be lower through the quarters and will sort of flatten out towards the end of this year on the revenue side. On the expense side a lot of the quarter-over-quarter numbers are functions of our comps periods. Our comp period at the beginning of this year, you know relative to the first half of 2016 are very easy -- are very hard, towards the end of the year they are much easier. We had relatively high expenses, same store in the back half of 2016. So, again, what I would tell you is when we sum this all up, we still feel good about our ranges and that\u2019s why didn\u2019t need them. But each quarter is going to have a lot of volatility based on its comparable period. Operator : Our next question comes from Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates. Ivy Zelman : First question, I was just hoping you could maybe clarify your comment on supply. I think earlier when you talked about the peak in supply in '17 and your analysis, you were speaking of it, it sounded like more from a start to endpoint from a capital availability and construction cost and so forth. So just wanted to clarify, when you think about supply and talk about '17 unit peak. Is that starts completions or lease-up pressure? David Neithercut : That\u2019s deliveries. We would have like a year in which a product is delivered, and I am glad you asked the question in that manner to us because we do track this. There is not, obviously, not simply in the year or quarter in which a property is delivered. And delivered means essentially complete. But our team is out in the field tracking very closely when those units will first be available for occupancy. And it really did become competition days prior to that. So there is a difference between when something is \"complete\", and when it actually is competition and we track the latter on quarter. Ivy Zelman : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And so as we triangulate against the national numbers which are showing both permits and starts being strong double-digits. So far this year I think even over the last six months, inputs the way, I guess, that\u2019s happening outside of your market concentration as you look at it? David Neithercut : Yes. I mean we are certainly aware of what those national numbers are and we are tracking those assets in our markets that we believe are competitive with us. And then just to add a little on the loan color side. Some of the feedback we have gotten from the banks and the brokers and the like, as it relates to our urban markets is that the banks are more interested in making loans in areas in the suburbs, where there is a little bit less construction over the last year or two. Just again seeing the numbers decline a little in the urban core is discouraging. Also they would suggest the hardest loan to do right now is a syndicated urban loan. So a very large $100 million-$150 million loan. From our perspective that\u2019s particularly good news because that\u2019s the kind of competition that David Santee and his team are facing most of these larger urban assets that do require pretty significant syndicated construction loans. David Santee : And just to double back on the deliveries in New York. Basically the easiest way to describe this is, where the concentrations are today, they are even more concentrated next year. So this year Brooklyn is 3700 units, next year Brooklyn is 4500 units. Queens this year, the Long Island City is 3000 units, next year that is 5700 units. So next year just between Brooklyn and Queens, that makes up 10,000 of the year of 17,000 units. Ivy Zelman : Okay. And then David Santee on the new lease and renewal rates. Thanks for the color by the markets as you progressed here into April and May. Do you have a portfolio-wide number on 2Q today for both new renewals. David Santee : Not Q2 to date. Just for the quarter. Ivy Zelman : Just for first quarter. Okay. We can follow up there. And then also just to clarify the comments you made on Boston. With new leases under pressure, I think you said 5% in the first quarter. And I thought you said that was going to moderate through the year but then I also thought you said that the supply was front half heavy. So maybe you could just clarify how you are seeing supply play out through the year and the trend in Boston. David Santee : Yes. So the supply is kind of coming on us right now and it's definitely concentrated back into the urban core and Cambridge. Kind of that\u2019s the same time that the students which make up a vast -- well, not a vast but a large majority of our residents in those two sub-markets, begin to give notice for the end of the school year. So there is just, the next several months will be a period of very high leasing activity where we try to prelease for fall of 2017. Operator : And from RBC Capital Markets, we will go next to Wes Golladay. Wes Golladay : Actually I was going to ask some questions on the international students, but I guess I will go to my next one. Looking at New York, when do you see that market reaching equilibrium when you factor in all the lease-up and maybe some, just maybe take a little bit longer to lease some of these projects. David Neithercut : Well, that\u2019s not just simply the discussion of supply that David shared with you, it's a function of the demand as well. So as I mentioned, product being delivered in '18 would continue to be the leasing up in '19. So it would take probably into '19 before things can stabilize unless we see a nice pickup in the higher paying jobs sector in New York which we all -- that we haven't seen in a while. Wes Golladay : Yes. Fair enough. I hope for that as well. And then looking at the increased retention ratio, is that something that\u2019s coming as a surprise and do you expect that to continue? David Neithercut : Well, if it is one quarter, while it was a more turns in the first quarter '17 than it was in the '16, it's still not a lot relative to the churn that we all experience throughout the whole year. As David mentioned, the overall spending we have spent and not just recently but over the last year, spent a lot of time training out people. Making sure they appreciate who important renewals are and the service expectations that we expect for them to deliver, to do that. And so we have every expectation, every hope that retention will remain strong because we have got our focus on it as David in his prepared remarks. Operator : And we will go next to Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Rich Anderson : So just if I could wrap up just a couple of things that were said but not explicitly committed to. New York, you said supplies moving out of the suburbs and into the -- out of the urban core into the suburbs in the sunbelt. Would you second that? Kind of directly can you answer that question? David Neithercut : In the sunbelt. No, I... Rich Anderson : From the urban core into the suburbs and the sunbelt. David Neithercut : I don\u2019t really have -- I know nothing about what's happening in the sunbelt. Although Mark Parrell just mentioned that the lending community had suggested that they prefer the smaller size loans out in the suburbs as opposed to the larger deals that require syndication downtown. But I have got to no -- can't comment on what's happening in the sunbelt. Rich Anderson : Fair enough. And then one question was answered, things are turning out the way you thought they would be turning out. And I am wondering if that\u2019s actually a good result. By that I mean, if you compare how you feel today versus how you felt in the fourth quarter when you were doing this call, would you say you feel incrementally better that things have actually stabilized and met your expectations and hence maybe you feel better about the future as well when you think about supply kind of starting to decelerate next year. Could you make that type of statement today or no? David Neithercut : I guess it's hard as we see here around the eve of the primary leasing season recognizing that we have the least amounts of actual transaction activity in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter. But we have talked about some markets like San Francisco maybe having found the bottom, having reset to a level, that David in his remarks mentioned, that in San Francisco we hope that the position, they have got more rational pricing as new products comes online. But we just do want to emphasize that work is yet to be done ahead. Because most of the leasing we will do, will be done in the next 90 days and we will have a better perspective of how it's going and we view the shape up when we visit with you at the end of July. Rich Anderson : Okay. And then just on New York, you mentioned, I think Santee, you called a disciplined. So do you feel like just specifically about that market despite all the commentary about supply, do you feel a little bit better going into the heavy leasing season in New York because of that discipline that you are sensing in this past quarter. David Santee : Yes. I certainly feel better but that doesn\u2019t mean things can't change very quickly. You know we look at our fully committed concessions, May looks very good and we will see how that plays out. But again, we still have to deliver, we are in the midst of delivering another 10,000 units on top of 10,000 units that are currently making in lease up. Operator : And we will take a follow up question from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Tayo Okusanya : I just wanted to understand the delta between the offers you send out for renewals and the actual rates you end up looking. What's happening to that delta? Does it continue to kind of expand? Is it starting to close up? I am just kind of trying to get a sense how tenants are reacting to the renewals offers that they have given? Mark Parrell : So we use March as an example since that\u2019s closed out. Typically that spread has been 180 basis points. We closed March at basically 190 basis points. So I would say for the most part all the market spreads are holding as we expected with a little wider spread in New York City. Operator : And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. McKenna, at this time I would like to turn the conference back to you for additional or closing remarks. Marty McKenna : Well, I thank you all for joining us and look forward to seeing many of you in New York City in June. Operator : And this does conclude today's presentation. Thank you all for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. And now I'll turn the call over to David Neithercut. David Neithercut : Thanks, Marty. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for today's call. We were pleased to continue to experience very deep and resilient demand for premier living across our markets. And as David Santee will explain in more detail in just a moment, most of our markets should meet or exceed our original expectation for revenue growth this year. It was driven by very strong occupancy, retention and renewal rates, despite elevated levels of new supply which continue to pressure lease rates in some markets. Across our portfolio, we see the benefits to our business of a growing economy, producing jobs, loans, unemployment, and rising incomes which continue to drive strong and steady demand for rental housing in our core markets. We also see the benefits of the remarkable customer service provided to our residents and prospects by our teams across the country. Their hard work and dedication really do drive our business and they inspire all of us each and every day. So now I'll let Dave Santee go into more detail about how our markets are performing during the extremely important leasing season, and then Mark Parrell will give some color on operating expenses and our guidance for this year. David. David Santee : Okay. Thank you, David. As we discussed on the last call, our relentless pursuit of delivering remarkable service to our current residents and getting them to renew with us in the phase of elevated deliveries is our number one goal. Our teams continue to deliver outstanding results achieving renewal increases of 4.8% for the quarter and a 100 basis point improvement in retention. Year-to-date annualized retention improved by a 150 basis points. Our Q2 revenue growth of 2.1% was driven by better-than-expected renewal rate growth and a 250 basis point increase in the percentage of residents who chose to renew with us. For the quarter, new leads over lease growth of 1.4% was shy of expectations, driven mostly by a choppy leasing environment in Washington D.C. Demand across all of our markets continues to be very good as evidenced by our reported occupancy for the quarter of 95.8% and a 96.1% occupancy we enjoy today. And despite the elevated deliveries that we are experiencing across our markets, we see no indication that demand has softened beyond the normal seasonal trends through the balance of the year. The percent of people in America who choose to rent versus own is now at a 50-year high. With a resurgence in job growth and more visible signs of upward wage pressure among the highest field and highly educated, we remained cautiously optimistic that our markets would continue to absorb new deliveries in an orderly fashions and continue to exhibit strong pricing discipline. As we sit here today with our projected full occupancy, we expect to be 40 basis points higher than same period last year and an exposure that is 60 basis points lower than last year, we are well positioned as we exit the peak leasing season. Renewal rates achieved should be 5% for July with August currently at 4.8%, with rates mostly baked for the full year, should we continue to experience better-than-expected occupancy through year end, full-year revenue results would be closer to the high end of our original guidance range. Moving on to the markets, Washington DC is our only market that we failed to meet or exceed our expectations, as job growth came to a grinding halt in April, while at the same time new deliveries were the highest of any quarter on record. Uncertainty around the new administration's ability to deliver on its agenda and a sharp falloff in procurement spending caused many government contractors to hit the pause button on hiring. As a result occupancy for the quarter was 70 basis points below Q2 of 2016. As a result of the choppiness in pricing, DC was our only market to see an increase in turn over for the quarter and flat quarter-over-quarter results of the percentage of residents renewing, as renters took advantage of attractive rental rates at newly delivered communities. While renewal rates achieved in DC in the quarter were up 4.8%, our new lease over lease results were minus 80 basis points. Well we remain cautiously optimistic that DC maybe getting back on track. The market is expected to have few deliveries of new units in the back half of the year, and currently we are achieving occupancy and exposure results that are better than the same time last year, and today our July billings show a 1.7% revenue growth versus July of 2016. This activity supports recent reports of job growth in DC being expected to reaccelerate. While we originally believed that Washington DC would be our only market that would deliver better results in 2017 than last year, we now see Washington DC delivering results similar to 2016. And New York City is exceeding our expectations, in that it is not as bad as we had planned. Despite the level of luxury product being brought to the market, owners have been remarkably disciplined with their pricing. However few '17 deliveries will not occur until Q3. Move-in concessions continue to be utilized mostly at new lease ups. The stabilized communities remained committed to net effective rents with minimal targeted concessions. From the dollar-volume perspective, year-to-date same-store concessions have averaged $485 per move-in or 3.8 days of free rent per move-in, which is down from first quarter of $575 per move-in or 4.5 days of free rent. Renewal rates achieved in New York were unchanged in Q1 of 2.3% and lease over lease pricing improved from negative 6.2% in Q1 to negative 1.8% in Q2. Factoring in the use of concessions year-to-date, net effective rates are down 2.3% from a year ago. Boston is on track to meet our full-year expectations as the expected new deliveries in the financial district in Cambridge put pressure on new lease rates. Student churn is still in process, but based on our current occupancy and exposure we should come out of peak season better positioned than we were in 2016. In Boston renewal rates achieved in the quarter were 4.4%, while new lease over lease rates were up 1.4%. With deliveries evenly spread across the quarters and peak season just about buttoned u, we think Boston has the potential to do modestly better than our original expectations. Moving over to the West Coast; Southern California, which represents almost 60% of our expected growth at the original midpoint of our guidance is on track to meet our full-year expectations. As expected Downtown LA and Pasadena are producing the weakest revenue growth as few submarkets have the greatest concentration of new supply. With new deliveries peaking in Q4 in both LA and Orange County potential speed bumps remain ahead, although both submarkets make up a very small percentage of our total revenue for the region. West LA revenue growth is accelerating as we had hoped as Silicon Beach continues its growth with virtually no new supply insight, and San Diego will exceed expectations with only a thousand units left to be delivered this year. For our South Cal portfolio, Q2 renewals achieved were 6.6% and lease over lease results were 2.4% with both LA and San Diego sitting today with 100 and 180 basis points less exposure respectively than last year, and Orange County flat for last year it is clear that today demand remains very strong across the entire region. San Francisco has certainly found its footing and should exceed our best case expectations for full year revenue growth. Despite delivering more units in 2017 than in 2016, the lease up environment appears to be significantly more accommodating. Like many of our markets San Francisco renewal increases are driving better-than-expected top-line growth, while year-to-date move-outs are down 12%. Renewals achieved for the quarter were up 4.4% with forwards months accelerating. Lease over lease results were up 1.5%, which was better than expected, and occupancy was right on target. While job growth in San Francisco has slowed compared to previous years, it still remains above the national average. With most - almost a 40% decline in expected deliveries for 2018, we see no reason why San Francisco won't continue to move up from here. Now we always believed that Seattle could deliver another year of very strong revenue growth, but with peak deliveries of almost 7,900 units we hedged our bets in our guidance. However, like last year Seattle continues to absorb units without a flinch. Amazon continues to try and rule the world and Microsoft is still a major player in cloud computing as evidenced by the Q2 results that we reported last week. Renewal rates achieved were up 7.8% on lower turnover, continue to drive top-line growth that will exceed our full year most optimistic expectations. Our lease over lease results were up 10.4% for the quarter, so all across our markets demand remained strong. Markets are absorbing new supply, some that bring minimal pricing pressure, some none at all. Our occupancy is better today than last year and our exposure and turnover are both lower than last year. So in closing, I'd just like to give all of our folks out there a big shout out for your focus, your commitment, and most importantly, delivering rate results. Mark Parrell : Thank you, David, and good morning. I want to take a couple of minutes today to talk about our same-store expenses, our revised plans for the year and our full year normalized FFO guidance. First off regarding our same store expenses, we have raised slightly the midpoint of our full-year same store expense guidance from 3.5% to 3.625% to reflect increased payroll costs as well as costs associated with the severe rains in California this year. And these costs were on both in payroll, in the form of higher property-level overtime, and through the repairs and maintenance line item. These elevated costs have been somewhat offset by our expectation of lower gift card spending in 2017, due to the strong renter demand that David Santee just discussed, and this should lower our leasing and advertising costs. Our year-to-date same store expense grow of 3.9% was primarily driven by increases in real estate taxes and in on-site payroll. We also had a relatively difficult comparable period. First half expense growth in 2016 was 0.9% and we will benefit from an easier company in the back half for 2017. Now I'll give you some color on some of the major expense items. We saw a 4.7% increase in real estate taxes in the second quarter that was driven by increases in Boston, Seattle and New York, with the New York increase in turn driven by the burn off of 421a tax evasions. For the year, we still expect same store expense growth for real estate taxes to be between 4% and 4.5%. Away from same store, we had a change in our estimates of the assessed value of several of our California development properties as well as a change in the expected timing of these assets going out on - going on the California tax rolls at their full value. This will increase non-same store real estate taxes for the full year by approximately $5 to $6 million. Turning back to same store and discussing payroll expenses, we said on several prior calls that we expect pressure in this category throughout the year. This is due to a combination of wage pressure to retain our property level employees in a very competitive market and the addition of staff in some markets to provide even better service to our residents and support tenant retention. These factors drove our original estimate that onsite payroll would grow by 4% to 5% for the full year. We now expect to increase about 6% in this category and that change is due primarily to higher estimates for certain employee medical insurance and Workmen's' Comp claims. We now expect leasing and advertising expense to decline 6% for the full year versus our prior estimate that this expense would be flat for 2017 versus 2016. L&A spending increased 2% in the second quarter of 2017 and 7.5% for the six months - first six months of 2017, so we expect a meaningful deceleration in L&A expense growth in the back half of this year. Please recall that we spent approximately $1 million in gift cards in 2016 all in the second half of that year. Driven by strong retention, low turnover, and high occupancy that we are now enjoying, we now anticipate that we will use less than 200,000 of the 700,000 in gift card spending we'd previously budgeted for 2017. In fact as of June, 30, we have spent almost nothing in this category. Moving on to the balance sheet, as you may have seen, we were upgraded by Moody's to A3. We are pleased to be recognized for our rock solid balance sheet and proud to be one of only a handful of REITs across all of the asset types to carry A ratings from all of the rating agencies. In our earning release, we raised the midpoint for our anticipated unsecured debt offering to $500 million from 400 million, as we consider a larger and earlier offering to take advantage of the opportunity to lock in today's favorable rates. We had planned to use the proceeds from an offering to pay down on our outstanding commercial paper and revolver balance, which today stands at a combined $900 million. So moving on to normalized FFO, in our earning release we raised the midpoint of our full-year same store revenue guidance to 2% from 1.6%, driven by all the positive factors David Santee just enumerated. I just went over our expectation of the modest increase in same store expenses, which collective caused us to raise the midpoint of our same store NOI guidance to 1.25% from 1%. On the normalized FFO side, we are picking up a bit more than $0.01 per share from higher same store NOI and smaller amounts from our expectation of less transaction dilution, due to the timing of our acquisition and disposition activity this year, and higher non-same store revenue; though this better non-same store revenue is more than offset by the increase in California development asset real estate taxes that I previously mentioned. Put all this in the blender and the result is a modest increase to our normalized FFO guidance midpoint going from $3.10 a share to $3.11 a share. So, all-in-all revenue has improved, expenses are generally on track, normalized FFO slightly improved, and positive news in relations to our credit ratings and our anticipated capital activity. And I'll now turn the call back over to David Neithercut. David Neithercut : All right. Thanks, Mark. Really quickly, before we open the call to questions, just a bit on capital allocation. As we noted in the press release last night transaction activity was modest in the second quarter when we acquired one asset and disposed off two. The property acquired was a 136-unit asset built in 2016, located in West Seattle, acquired for $57 million with 418,000 of unit at a cap rate of 5%. During the quarter, we disposed off a 312-unit property, a secondary submarket of Cambridge, Massachusetts for $168 million or $535,000 a door at a disposition yield of 4.5%. And a 288-unit property located in Franklin, Massachusetts for $51 million or $177,000 a door at a disposition yield of 6.7%. Now year-to-date, the $267 million of dispositions have the weighted average disposition yield of 5.3%. This compares favorably to the recent acquisition at a 5% cap rate. We've also got several other deals we're currently underwriting, which we believe could be acquired at cap rates ranging from the mid-fours to low fives. As a result, while we've maintained the guidance of $500 million of acquisition activity, a $500 million of disposition activity for the year, we've narrowed that - the spread of that activity from 75 basis points to 50 for the year. So right, operator, we'd be happy to open the call for questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Nick Joseph with Citi Group. Please go ahead. Nick Joseph : Thanks. How much of year-to-date revenue outperformance do you tribute to better-than-expected demand versus benefiting from some of the expected supply being delayed and delivered a little later than probably you originally anticipated? David Santee : This is David, Nick, David Santee. When we look at our deliveries there's only a couple of markets that have really had any significant delays, specifically New York, but that's only 700 units that kind of got shifted from the first half to the back half. And then the only other market of any significance would be DC, again only 700 units that moved from the front half year to the back half. So I would say that most of this performance is driven by continued strong demand. Nick Joseph : Thanks. And then in terms of development, how does the four seven stabilized yield on the Freemont deal compare to your original underwriting? David Neithercut : David Neithercut here, Nick. Generally the ballpark, that property was impacted significantly by the - this downturn or step back at San Francisco we experienced a year ago. We started lease up of that property in April of last year and you know that it was just around that time in the spring time that San Francisco began to weaken. So that number - essentially sort of met our expectations. I can tell you that in 2015 or early 2016 we had thought we'd do significantly better but it generally met our original expectations, which frankly if you think about it were Type-1 construction, in such a phenomenal location that those are lower expected going in years. Nick Joseph : Thanks. And just finally, what's the expected stabilized yield on the remaining projects, and maybe if you can provide a range on the low-end and the high end? David Neithercut : Well, the other product excluding Freemont would have a weighted average yields in 5.5 to low 6's. Nick Joseph : Thanks. David Neithercut : You're very welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from Nick Yulico with UBS. Nick Yulico : Thanks. I was hoping you could give updated thoughts on the submarket revenue growth projections. I think you had last updated them on the 4Q call? Mark Parrell : Okay. So I'm going to give you the likely full year revenue growth expectations. Boston remains at 1.5. New York remains - improved to minus 30 basis points. Washington DC, 1.4; Seattle, 5.75; San Francisco, 1.8; Southern California, I'll give it to you by major market, LA is - remained steady at 36; Orange County, 4.5; and San Diego 4.25. Nick Yulico : Okay, appreciate that. Just going back to the supply topic, we looked at it today; it looks like the second quarter and third quarter of this year, just using Axiometrics data was the largest amount of supply completions in this cycle. And we've gone through first half of the year and seen some of the impact on fundamentals and you've talked about a couple of other markets like New York, DC and parts of Southern California where the supply impact actually hit deliveries' pick up a bit in the second half of the year. How should we be thinking about where we are versus the supply in this cycle? And because I think we're trying to - a lot of us are trying to wrestle with of have we gone through this supply or - and we've seen the impact to rent growth or is there still kind of this lingering issue in the back half of the year and into next year where there's still a fair amount of supply that could pressure rent growth. Just I'd love to hear your thoughts on that. David Neithercut : On - and it's David Neithercut here. There's certainly supply coming this year and we expect supply next year. Nick, in some markets we expect supply to diminish next year, in other markets we expect there - it will be so modestly more. But fortunately and as we've already discussed, demand remains strong, occupancy is strong and retention very strong. So, so far the market has demonstrated enough depth to absorb that supply. And while it's too early to call 2019 in many markets, our expectation is that we will see a decrease in supply beginning in 2019. Nick Yulico : Thanks. David Neithercut : You're welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steve Sakwa, Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. David Santee, I appreciate all the color that you gave on the new and the renewals by market. Do you sort of have a rolled-up blended number for the portfolio on sort of renewals and new just for the whole portfolio? David Santee : So the combined number for the new lease and renewals for Q2 was 3.2%. Steve Sakwa : Okay, thanks. And then maybe just kind of coming back to New York for a minute, could you just talk a little bit more about the new supply, the impact, maybe some of the submarkets? And are there projects that you either see being put on hold or perhaps have been delayed or cancelled at this point that maybe give you a little more confidence about the outlook, say 18 to 24 months from now in New York? David Santee : We update our supply or our expected deliveries every quarter. Obviously, we wouldn't expect any cancellations in 2017. These deals are pretty much ready to open the doors. Certainly, the concentrations in New York are specifically Brooklyn and Long Island City. That's where - we have nothing in Long Island City, but we are monitoring any potential impact that Long Island City could have on surrounding submarkets. New supply in Brooklyn is more north than in east of us in Downtown, but nevertheless we are feeling some of the pricing pressure and Brooklyn would be our lowest performing submarket in the metro area. David Neithercut : In - Steve, in New York City I believe with a competitive product which is all high-rise kind of product. We've got a 40-or-so-month sort of building cycle in that marketplace. So anything later than 2018 we've sort of known in there. Anything that's a surprise in '18 only slips from '17 or a surprise in '17 yes, will be moved up from '18. And it's going to be very soon before anything that's going to be delivered in 2019 got to be underway. And so we've got a pretty good handle we think in New York City as to what the supply is this year and next year, and we expect a - based upon what our guys in the field are monitoring, a meaningful decline in new deliveries in 2019. Steve Sakwa : Okay, and I guess last question, David just in terms of capital allocation and thinking about development, I know you've really taken your foot off the gas. Are there any kind of land parcels or any potential new developments that you guys are exploring or looking at, at this point or pretty much deliver these four projects and kind of wait for the next cycle? David Neithercut : Yes. We've got a couple of projects that could begin yet this year, which are frankly quite small. We've got a deal in Seattle that we expect, that we've already given approval to the guys to build, which is just $62 million. We've got a small deal of less than $50 million on a - sort of a site adjacent to an existing property that we got in the Archstone transaction which could begin yet this year. So that's just a $100 million or so. Beyond that we've got some sites that we currently have in LA and in the Bay Area and in Boston that we could do something on but we're not going to pursue those very aggressively at the current time. I mean the teams continue to work on them, but I - we'll just sort of see how things play out. We're not - we're looking - I mean we continue to underwrite new land sights, the guys continue to look at what's out there but there's nothing that we find attractive, given where costs are today and the pressure on land costs, the pressure on construction cost and where yields are today. And I guess I'd tell you that the product that Alan George and his team are looking to acquire today, products built in 2016 or 2017, we believe there's opportunity to buy some of that product at current replacement cost or maybe even a modest discount there too. So in present time we just don't look at that development as particularly compelling, yes, then we do have some things in the pipeline as I said that we could start this year, some other product that we'll continue to keep the close eye on but should not expect to see us be taking down new land sights in the near future. Steve Sakwa : Okay, thanks. That's it for me. Operator : We will take our next question from Conor Wagner, Green Street Advisors. Conor Wagner : Thank you, good morning. Good, thank you guys. David Neithercut, could you comment on the transaction market a bit more? Have you seen any change year-to-date, given that some of these markets have recovered? Has buyer or seller expectations - have they changed at all? David Neithercut : Well, transaction volume is down meaningfully from a year Conor. But as we talked a lot about with various investors that we met in New York, in June, those transactions which are taking place continue to take place sort of at cap rates and valuations that I think remain very solid and within - generally within the same valuation range as of a year or so ago. So transaction volume is down but valuations and cap rates are pretty much where they've been. Now I can tell you that the brokerage community will constantly tell us that we're working on a lot of opinions or value and that they know a lot of owners that are interested in selling product, and we expect to see product but at the present time it's down considerably from a year ago. Conor Wagner : Great, thank you. And then maybe David Santee, if you could comment on how the rehab program has been going year-to-date in terms of the type of returns you've been getting on your kitchen and bath upgrades, and then, if you can refresh me if those - if that's been focused on any particular markets or if it's been evenly spread across the portfolio? Mark Parrell : Hey Conor, it's Mark Parrell. No, it's pretty well spread out throughout the portfolio. We continue to see cash returns on at - in the 12%, 13% or so range. We are doing a little more this year than we have in past years. So this year it's more like 8 % of revenue and typically it's been more like a 7%. And we mentioned, I think a couple of quarters ago, we're going to have to sort of accelerate some things in terms of customer facing improvements like clubhouses and the like, and expect that to kind of go back down next year. So just in terms of geography, it's pretty well spread out throughout the portfolio. Conor Wagner : Great. Thank you. Mark Parrell : You're welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Kim, BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Thank you. I'm interested in your commentary on the demand in DC weakening this quarter. I think last quarter you alluded to it and now it's a little bit more pronounced. In your opinion, is confidence in the Trump administration the key driver of future demand? And if the approval ratings remain low, is there a chance that your 2017 figures in DC will not meet 2015? David Neithercut : Well I - based upon things that I've read, I think a lot of it just has to do with actually filling jobs of - in positions that actually can approve procurement contracts. So I think last call there was probably almost 400 vacant positions across all departments and many of these positions were folks that approved procurement contracts. So certainly, it appears that the market has rebounded, although it's not going to see the rate growth that we had hoped. But the rate growth has improved, occupancy has improved, demand has improved. But yet there are still potential obstacles ahead and procurement is going to drive the strength of DC. John Kim : Okay. And then I'm not sure if you have disclosed this in the past but what percentage of your leases are backed by guarantor? And I'm wondering, if you have tracked this, how this has trended over time? David Neithercut : It's a very small percentage. Typically, we're talking about more student-oriented properties and then where we have most students or in the case of international students, we actually refer these folks to a third party that they can purchase guarantee insurance that insures us for the full balance of the lease should they default. John Kim : And are these excluded from the rents-to-income figures and can you also just update that on - that figure for the - this quarter? David Neithercut : Yes. We do exclude guarantors certain - we actually exclude income below a certain level I think - and above a certain level. So we kind of chop off the extremes so that we get at a more well-rounded number. The revenue - the rent-to-income ratios really remained unchanged. I think what is more interesting is just how we kind of look at the total income of our residents that moved in last July versus the total income of the residents that moved in - up to this year data\u2026 David Santee : Yes, it's David. So I mean - we've looked at close to 30,000 new leases for the 12 months ending July '16 and the 12 months ending July '17 of the same store set. So it was just those leases that had been entered into in that trailing 12 months. And the average incomes are up 4% year-over-year and the median income up almost 6% year-over-year, and in both instances, the average rent-to-income or median rent-to-income is down in seven of eight markets. So we continue to see very strong incomes and very acceptable and perhaps even low rent-to-income levels. And even Seattle, which has experienced some of the biggest expense growth, continues to have the lowest along with Manhattan the lowest average rent-to-income and median rent-to-income. John Kim : That's very helpful. Thank you. David Santee : You bet. Operator : We'll take our next question from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Vincent Chao : Hey everyone. Just a quick question on Seattle, just continues to sort of defy gravity in terms of the performance there, even in the face of new supply. But I was just curious, I mean the job growth there, still very strong versus the rest of the country but has been decelerating fairly quickly. I was just curious if the demands out there from a job-growth perspective has met your expectation, and then, I think last quarter you said that Seattle was expected to peak in the second half. Is that third quarter or fourth quarter, I don't know if you maybe update us? David Neithercut : Yes, we run into a tougher comp in the back half of the year versus last year, but - I mean we just don't see any change in demand in Seattle. I mean we project some softness that really just has never materialized, and we've kind of taken that approach over the last four years in some of these submarkets, especially when there is a community that's going up down the street or across the street and we expect to have to see some softness, and frankly, we've just never seen it. And our barometer is the open positions at Amazon, and I think, last quarter they were 10,000 and I think last week, they were 8,500. And then with the continued growth in cloud computing, I think Seattle has created - it's created a niche as the backbone and the plumbing of all things that are generated out of in Dallas. So Seattle remains very strong. Vincent Chao : Okay. Just maybe if you could just remind us, I know you talked about the focus on service and the turnover ratios have been reflective of that and I think some of the increased wage growth has been part of that as well. I was just curious; can you just remind us what you're doing at the asset level to sort of really drive that service level home with tenants? David Neithercut : Well, I think it's really - it all starts at the top, right? And I think we've talked about our efforts on the last call. All of our senior team, myself, Michael Manelis, people from other departments visited each and every market, jade outside of our expectations, we continued to try and experience - tried new approaches with resident experiences. We have a very deliberate and active kind of activity program that we're piloting in New York City. Our - we're focusing as well on our employees, giving them the training that they need. Certainly, we are watching compensation. Mark talked about our wage pressure in our industry. But I'm also pleased to report that turnover through the first quarter of all onsite employees was down a 120 basis points versus same time last year. So I think everything that we're doing is providing a very significant return on investment in our time. I also like to say that Tom Lebling, who is our Senior VP of Property Management, is very instrumental in making sure that all of our folks are all on the same page and that our messages are very clear and we're all going in the same direction. Vincent Chao : Good thanks a lot. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Robert Stevenson : Good morning guys. David Santee, given your comments about the weakness in DC, you've seen any meaningful performance differential between the various Northern Virginia submarkets, between themselves, and then also versus the district proper? David Santee : We had more supply in the RBC corridor in Q2. We have a large percentage of our portfolio there. But I would say just in general the entire region seemed to have hit pause button. There's numerous - even for [indiscernible] there's numerous publications that you can read, but I think of it just this dark cloud over the entire region, partly fueled by a short fall off in procurement spending. Robert Stevenson : Okay. And then David Neithercut, how would you characterize your relationship today with Airbnb? You guys working with, trying to combat stuff, I mean where does that stand today? David Neithercut : We continue to work with Airbnb on a handful of properties that have a - that we've earned only because of our working with them. We've got a high share, a large share of the activity to work with them till we get some transparency and understanding and control as to a lot of activity that's taking place on our properties. So far we think that that's working fairly well and is a better approach than what others are - have decided to tackle themselves. Robert Stevenson : What type of control are you getting relative to when you don't know that somebody is renting? I mean are you getting approval process - how do you characterize it? David Neithercut : Because of what we're doing with them we do know what's taking place on our property. And the only way one does know is by working with them. And so we have absolute understanding about what's taking place on our properties and have control of being able to turn people on and turn people off and limit the amount of activity that's taking place on any given property at any given time. So because of what we're doing with Airbnb, we do have knowledge and then will have control of it, that those who do not work with Airbnb won't have. Robert Stevenson : Okay thanks guys. Operator : We'll take our next question from Geoffrey Liu [ph] with Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst : Hey thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to go over the Bay Area and if you could talk a little bit about the performance of the CBD versus the submarkets, if there is any differences there? David Santee : Well I guess I would say that certainly last year the CBD, especially our same store CBD which were all the assets spread in great locations went head-to-head with all of this new supply and the concentration in Downtown. But let me - so year-to-date, Downtown is performing all on par with our full-year expectations. So I said our revised number was I think 1.8 and today San Francisco is currently doing positive, Downtown is doing positive that 1.9. Unidentified Analyst : Great thanks and then just also on the Bay Area, the concessions, if you can maybe talk about Rincon Hill versus the Design District in your asset, 100 items there, what you're seeing maybe in terms of concessions and then also if you're seeing anything kind of towards the San Mateo Peninsular area, if you're seeing any concessions there? David Neithercut : So as a general statement we are not utilizing concessions at any stabilized properties across the entire San Francisco MSA. I would tell you that demand at Henry Adams has been very strong. We - depending upon our lease-up pace, we have kept concessions in place but at the same time raised the suite rate. In some situations we have removed concessions. So it's, - leasing up a building a very dynamic process and you want to - we don't set it and forget it, and we're always trying to optimize revenue by pulling the levers that are appropriate given the pace of lease up. So we are seeing very good results at Henry Adams, and while we see very few concessions in the submarkets that we're in, we are not utilizing concessions. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates Dennis McGill : Hi, thank you guys. One question just going back to the phasing of deliveries in 2017, I think you touched on this in a few markets, but if you were to look across your markets how much of the deliveries do you guys show today being in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year, percentage wise? David Santee : Across the entire portfolio, simply it's 30,000 units in the first half and 35,000 in the back half across the entire portfolio. Not a whole a lot of that. Dennis McGill : Okay. And then just to clarify, I think a point you made earlier on the seasonality of business, just to clarify; when you look at the leasing trends that you've assumed within the guidance second half of the year is that reflect normal seasonality, better than normal seasonality, worse than normal seasonality? David Santee : No, just normal seasonality in the original guidance. Dennis McGill : Okay. And then last question, I think there was a comment on as you get out to '19 everything you can look at today would suggest you'll see a decrease in supply. The comment on '18 though was a little bit back and forth, I guess depending on the market. Again, holistically, if you were to look at '18 today, is that more of a flattish trend in supply? Is that what you were implying David? David Santee : Well '18 numbers on a portfolio basis currently are pretty on par with our '17 deliveries. So you really have to kind of get down to the market level. So New York in 2018, we would expect more deliveries. Let's see, Boston we would expect fewer deliveries; San Francisco, significantly fewer deliveries in '18; Seattle, slightly fewer. The big pop would be LA in 2018 when contained almost 14,000 units, but that's - that hasn't been a secret. Orange County, kind of same, 5000 this year, 5000 next year; and then San Diego, call it 3000 units next year versus 2500 this year. Dennis McGill : Okay, very helpful. Thank you, guys. Operator : We'll take our next question from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Juan Sanabria : Hi, thank you. Just on the expense side, you guys made allusion on the top plan that you could be at the high end if occupancy kind of holds in relative to where you are to date. Any comments on the same store expense side on comfort level at the high or low end and how you're thinking about that? Mark Parrell : It's Mark Parrell. No, I mean I think 3.6 right at the middle is kind of how we feel right now. We don't really have a bias either way and relatively small amounts of money on a $600 million same store expense budget can move us a tenth. So I think a lot of our rate's kind a little down the middle at this juncture. You've got a question, Juan? Operator can we\u2026 Juan Sanabria : Can you hear me? Mark Parrell : Now we can, yes. Juan Sanabria : Sorry. Just with regards to new lease trends in the second quarter and in July, could you just give us a sense how those trended across the portfolio, kind of on a month basis? If you were getting the benefits of seasonality kind of through June and into July? David Neithercut : Yeah, I'm not really sure how to answer your question. Our new lease rates with the exception of Washington DC are trending equal to or slightly better than we'd expected. Juan Sanabria : But was the year-over-year change in June better than April and May? Just trying to get a sense of the - how the curve looked throughout the quarter into July? David Santee : Yeah. Well the new lease rates obviously were much better in Q1 than Q2. From April to June, the curve generally moves up and it moved up just as it has in previous years. So really no change to what we see from previous years. Its following the same curve just at a lower level. Juan Sanabria : Okay. And then just one last question for me. Are you guys doing any - have any programs or plans in place to take advantage of maybe demand for shorter term leases as some of your peers are looking to harness that demand? David Santee : I guess I would say we used to have a corporate housing company - equity corporate housing many years ago that focused on corporate leases. We're not really looking to get - add additional volatility to our operations. In fact, we've kind of gone the other way. When you stick with LRO and our yield management systems, I mean typically, these systems price shorter term units in many cases probably a 100% higher than a 12-month lease rate. So if somebody wants to pay double the rent, we'd certainly entertain that but it's not a segment of the business that we're actively pursuing. Juan Sanabria : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Tayo Okusanya : Yes, good morning. I'm just trying to reconcile the same store NOI growth guidance for the year. First half of the year you're averaging about 1.7%, for the year the midpoint is about 1.25%. So we're still kind a talking about further slowdown in same-store NOI growth in the back half of '17. But we're talking about less supply and better demand trends at this point. So I'm just struggling a little bit to kind of reconcile why the slower same store NOI growth in the back half of the year? Mark Parrell : Yes. So maybe can just assemble that to revenue and expense. I think if your point is our current guidance will of course imply lower same store quarter-over-quarter revenue some number around 1.8% in each of the next two quarters. If things go as David Santee implied they may in the back half of this year and we continue to stay very well occupied and we have good renewals then that revenue number would be much closer to the very top end of our range and we won't see that deceleration, so that that NOI number will be higher. On expenses, we just spoke to that, I mean we do have different, very different comp periods. We had a tough comp period the first half of this year, we'll have in each year once in the back half of this year but we still think 3.6 is a pretty good number. So I guess I'd sort of look at it that way that the two pieces sort of aren't moving in sync necessarily and on the revenue side we may pick something up here as things continue to go pretty well for us. Tayo Okusanya : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Rich Hill : Hi, good morning guys. Want to spend a little bit more time maybe understanding how your same store revenue, maybe when it will drop and when maybe when it will begin to accelerate a little bit more. And so if I think about this in terms of guidance I think your guidance is implying around the 1.5% same store revenue for 2H, what's driving that? Because I know you already mentioned that there is really strong demand trends in place which I fully appreciate, given everything that we're seeing. So is it really just a supply bottleneck that's occurring in 2H? We had heard some commentary previously that some of the 1H supply got pushed into 2H. So do you see a whole bunch of supply coming in 2H and then when can we really start to see it reaccelerated - reaccelerate again? Is it maybe a 1Q '18, is it more of a 2Q '18? I do recognize you said by 2019 things are looking a lot better. So maybe any more color about how we should think about the velocity of same store revenue relative to what your guidance is implying. Mark Parrell : Thanks for that question. Its Mark Parrell. I'm going to start and we're going to kind of hand it off between us because that's a big question with different aspects. But just mathematically that implication is more like a 1.7 or 1.8 for the back half of this year. And if things go as we sort of hope and as David Santee implied in his remarks, prepared remarks, we wouldn't see any deceleration, and the third and fourth quarter as quarter-over-quarter numbers will be the same number more or less, maybe slightly higher than the number we just reported of 2.1 for the second quarter of '17 over the second quarter of '16. So and now David if you want to comment a little bit on just the supply\u2026 David Santee : Yes. So I mean I think the key point to remember is that this 2017 in many markets is peak supply, peak deliveries. For the most part the expected deliveries that got pushed from the back half - the front half to the back half is really its miniscule, and we don't see it having any material impact on how we operate and our expected results. So it's just a matter of - as an example in New York as new supply continues to open the doors does pricing continue to remain disciplined or does there - is there a more dislocation that could occur in the market. So in DC you still have continued supply expectations for full year job growth of economic performance across the MSA is dependent upon the - Congress passing the budget. So I think there's many potential speed bumps that could have an impact on performance to varying degrees in some of these markets. But we see - but going back to demand, demand continues to remain strong regardless of these other potential speed bumps that I mentioned, and so at the end of the day it would be how the markets react to any changes in the leasing environment. Rich Hill : Understood, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Neil Malkin with RBC Capital Markets. Neil Malkin : Thanks guys, thanks for taking my questions. First, I don't think you needed - but can you give what new lease rate growth has done to July I know it's basically over so do you have an idea on that it was at above the 1.8 that you did in second quarter? Mark Parrell : We don't have that number yet. Neil Malkin : Okay. And then kind of towards the West coast markets, I'm wondering if you guys think the Trump administration's sort of hard lined on H1B visas and immigration can or either potentially have an impact on some demand in some of your apartments and then secondly if you think that sort of the reduction in legal immigration has had an impact on choking further the already heavily constrained labor issues going on in the market? David Santee : Well, first to address the H1B visa, I think when you look at what actually occurred. I think that's a net benefit to our portfolio. I mean the only thing that the administration changed regarding H1B visas is making sure that they are used as they were intended to be used, which is for highly skilled, highly compensated labor versus many of the shops that were bringing over outsourcing employees that - these outsourced employees were coming into IT shops and they - having to train these outsourced people. So I think I mean there is no decline in the number of H1B visas and so really the only significant change was the elimination of the express approval in the H1B visa process. So net, net, net I think the focus on the H1B visa is a strong positive for our portfolio. As far as immigration, certainly it is very challenging. From a construction perspective, there are definite shortages in construction which is driving up labor cost. We feel that in our day-to-day apartment turnover, repairs and maintenance, rehabs, it is definitely being felt. And hopefully it will be addressed going forward. Neil Malkin : I agree and then lastly from me, given your balance sheet strength and that your development program is kind of idled for now, are you looking at any mass lending or loan down situations on some West Coast developments that you can get an attractive return while you wait and then possibly take out that project at a later date? Mark Parrell : That's an interesting two-part question. As it relates to providing capital financing or loans for projects that might not otherwise get built, we're not in the business to providing said capital. Would we be interested in providing some capital or something or some project that we might be interested in only upon completion and have some sort of option to buy, we'd certainly consider that, but have not seen much of that opportunity today. Neil Malkin : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Daniel Santos with Sandler O'Neill. Daniel Santos : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just one quick one from me, I want to go back to CapEx. It seems that's been ramping up year-to-date and just wondering if you expect that trend to continue? And whether you would say that's allowed you to boost trends or is just keeping your units competitive? Mark Parrell : Yeah, it's Mark Parrell. So we feel like we're sort of on track for our guidance number for the year which is $2600 unit number. So we typically do more CapEx in the third quarter but it takes a while to get all these things going. So no, we don't feel like we're off track on that, I think at all. And in terms of boosting revenue, all I could tell you is we took a look at the 30 to 40 projects that we have underway on the rehab side and took the rent results from those smart properties isolated and we compare them with the rest of the same store set, and it really just again because of where the projects are located and what the momentum of those deals are, meaning, how many units have already been improved and how many haven't. It made no difference to our reported number year-to-date. Daniel Santos : Got it, thanks. That's helpful. That's all for me. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Unidentified Analyst : Hey it's Michael calling in with Nick. Maybe another question, I'm curious if you can talk little bit about sort of the stock price you've recognized the stock is a little bit out of your control. But more so from the perspective of now your shares of trigger of the discount to underlying asset value NAV while your peers are effectively in line. So there is both on absolute discount but more importantly a relatively discount to your peers. And understanding from the challenges that happened last that sort of exacerbated that discount and perhaps some of the weaker same store NOI this year could be attributed to it. I'm curious when your board asks you why the stock is trading where it is and what things you can do now to help narrow that gap, what's your response? What are you doing to help drive the relative performance? Mark Parrell : Well, but we've spend a lot of time with investors and investment community explaining what's going on in our markets and what's going on in the transaction markets and the underlying value of our assets. It's been as much time as possible with limited success but what sounds to success having more of those conversions with generalized investors. Well I think that have been more of an impact on evaluations and relative evaluations in the space. We've acknowledged that we stubbed our toe last year and we're working on a way out of that. We've also have acknowledged that our strategy of having our assets primarily in the higher-density locations and probably with high lock scores are experiencing elevated levels of new supplies on a relative basis that's put us in a position this year perhaps less than the same sort of revenue growth and NOI growth as others might be experiencing. But nothing has changed in our mind nor our Board's mind about the long term move to that strategy, as demonstrated by a lot of material that we provided in our investor brochures information about the performance of these higher density markets over extended time periods. So we are having conservations that explaining people what's going on. I'm happy to have this opportunity in this call to reiterate the depth of the demand we're seeing across our markets and the way that our assets are performing and the job our teams are doing out there. But, we already have a cyclic business and at the present time because of the new supply we're a little bit more challenged on the top line perhaps other compared to others, but we remain convinced that we're in the right assets and in the right markets as the nation continues to re-urbanized and there is more and more people to live in the high density urban markets. Do you have any another question Michael? Unidentified Analyst : Can you hear me? Okay? Mark Parrell : I can now. Yes. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. As you think you're going into next year, you have more free cash flow available for pipelines down. How are you thinking strategically about potential stock buybacks as one way that if you - if you believe and the value of asset base and where the stocks trading and AB that way or two selling additional assets either into partnerships with institutional investors who appear who still have a lot of interest in the multifamily space or taking a much more aggressive disposition program in being able to take advantage of the discount that your stock trades at both on an absolute and relative basis. David Santee : Well the stock will continue to trade at a discount NAV is that gap is narrowed over the past 90 days or so and we'd said even when it was trading it at a larger discount and we didn't think it was at a level that made stock buybacks make up a great deal of sense for us. As we experienced in the sale of portfolio to Starwood last year and as we've talked a lot about joint venturing assets or selling assets we got up a significant amount of gain built into these assets that we acquire a significant pay out should we go down in that path that does not provide a significant amount of free cash flow after the fact to make any meaningful impact on the stock price in stock buyback. As it relates to free cash flow, I think we've mentioned on these calls in the past that after having our free cash flow for above $275 million or so million dollars a year, after having that targeted to a very profitable development business over the past five or so years, that having brought those stock down beginning 2015 and in 2016 and in this year that might by 2018, to your point we will have meaningful amount of free cash flow that will not be targeted for that development business anymore and will be available to do a handful of things. And we've sat with our board in June, continue to have a conversation with them and let them know of those various options that we might have with respect to use of that cash. We could pay down debt, that we could buy stock back, we could increase the regular ended dividend, we could buy assets, we could start developments and we do have a lot of flexibility option with respect to that particularly in light of the recent balance sheet - the perfect sort of - as Mark Parrell mentioned. So we got a lot of flexibility there and we have socialized that notion with our board and we will continue to discuss with them that optionality as we go forward. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks David. Operator : And for our final question in the queue, we will go to Jim Sullivan with BTIG. James Sullivan : Thank you. We have seen some material increases in commodity cost this year but I don't think you have raised your estimated development costs. Are you not seeing some pressures here or is it just the costs were fixed before the recent increases in commodity costs? David Santee : Yes, just the fact that these prices were fixed, the development that we are now delivering and those prices with contracts where they are left a long time ago. Now I can tell you and I mentioned earlier we have recently approved. If they start a construction of the project in Seattle and we see those construction costs go up meaningfully but we will knock that down at the present time. So and certainly you have got a lot about the fires in Canada and the impact on lumber. There was just a lot of pressure on costs lot of pressure on - lot on pressure on construction costs as David mentioned pressure on - which makes up a pretty big share of total costs which all the leases why among many that we had serve taken their foot of the gas on the development side of our business beginning in 2016. James Sullivan : So given that the revenue projections in Seattle and San Francisco which is where I think about 80% of you pipeline is located have are improving, is it fair to conclude that the kind of the value creation spread on that development pipeline is there if anything increasing. David Santee : We are certainly increased from when we started those projects. We just noted that we stabilized our deal - and San Francisco ad up 4.57 or so number we are in some discussion earlier about how that played out relative to original expectations but that deal would trade all day along with the - end so certainly made money there, we certainly made money on all of the developments. But we have seen those views on new developments begin to compress considerably and personal position where we questioned at least a move of continuing development going forward. But certainly in Seattle we have done very well, revenues has grown significantly - down are significantly so the yields that we are executing there that exceed our expectation in the San Francisco at or have modestly exceeded our expectations but cap rates has played low and the value creation has been very impressive in all those transactions. James Sullivan : Okay the quick question on Boston, you had mentioned in the prior call that you that the international student demand weakening as a potential negative variable of Boston, is there any sign of that here in the third quarter? David Neithercut : Yeah. So we has been very aware of the potential for that and we have been asking as many questions responsible but based on the level of new deliveries and that our in the financial district and - which tend to be a little more student reliant given our occupancy, given our exposure as we come out of the student churn it think it's safe to say that we haven't seen any impact at all from that. James Sullivan : Okay really good and then the final question for me following on from Michael Dylan's [ph] question about strategy. Apparently we may see more details on the administration's proposed tax overall this week. I wonder David if you can give us your insights as to what the likely proposal maybe for section 10/31 and if 10/31 were to be eliminated or as proposed or as been talked about what the impact might be in your recycling strategies? David Santee : Well we don't know what will come out of it and I am not sure the President knows what's going to come out of the proposal. Certainly there has been a lot of discussion about 10/31 and we have been one of probably the biggest user of 10/31 during the past 10 years there is anyone, in fact our transaction with Starwood, which was a $2.5 billion 10/31 in our part so much of the benefit of the 10/31's that we've already used and could certainly go forward quite comfortably even if there was a change there. I would suggest though that if something did happen to 10/31 that the relative value in unit could become significant more valuable in the more of the real estate. It's a security that I think has not been utilized to the extent that we would have hoped in the past but I think - if 10/31 is to go away I think it would be very beneficial to reach that able to issue both the units in an acquisition situation. James Sullivan : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : At this time there is no further questions in the queue, I would like to turn the conference back to your speakers for any additional or closing remarks. David Santee : Well, thanks everybody for your time today, I hope you will have a wonderful summer and we will forward to see many of you come in September. Thank you so much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference we appreciate your participation.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead. Marty McKenna : Thanks, James. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's third quarter 2017 results. Our featured speakers today are David Neithercut, our President and CEO; David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Parrell, our Chief Financial Officer. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. And now I'll turn the call over to David Neithercut. David Neithercut : Thank you, Marty. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for today's call. We were pleased that across our markets we continue to experience very deep and resilient demand for apartment living. As David Santee will explain in more detail in just a moment, despite elevated levels of new supply our portfolio performed very well during the lease confusion. Driven by great property management and operational support teams that will now deliver results for the full year that will meet or exceed our original expectations for revenue growth in every markets day one Across our portfolio we see the benefits to our business with an expanding economy producing jobs, loans, unemployment, and rising incomes which continue to drive strong and steady demand for rental housing in our core markets. As a result we now expect to achieve year-over-year growth of same store revenue and net operating income towards the upper end of our original expectations and our year-over-year growth in normalized funds from operations will be the upper end of the range we provided last February as well. So I\u2019ll let David Santee go into more detail about how our markets performed during the extremely important third quarter and then Mark Parrell will give some color on operating expenses and our guidance for this year. David Santee : Okay. Thank you, David. I am extremely pleased with the performamce of our property teams during our busiest quarter of the annual business cycle as they continued to deliver remarkable service and renewal results despite elevated deliveries across all of our markets. In addition to the 4.7% renewal rate increases achieved for the quarter, our annualized year-to-date retention improved 230 basis points which was up 80 basis points from Q2. In addition to renewing 54% of our expiring leases for the quarter, occupancy improved by 40 basis points sequentially and was 20 basis points better quarter-over-quarter. And as I said on the previous call, physical [ph] occupancy continued to hold which it has, we would deliver full year results at the high end of our original guidance which we will.  With 2017 deliveries peaking in the second half of the year across most of our markets, our results demonstrate that demand for quality, urban apartments, continues to be very good. And as I\u2019ve stated last quarter, we see no indications that demand will soften beyond the normal seasonal trends for the balance of the year. Renewal rate thus far for October are 4.6%, with occupancy 20 bips higher than same week last year at 96.3% and available inventory flat we are in a good position to end the year and deliver full year revenue growth of 2.3%. Moving out of the markets, again no different than last quarter, Washington DC is our only market that will fail to meet or exceed our original expectations. As peak deliveries from Q2 led into Q3, rates have stabilized community further deteriorate in the Central district sub market. Federal job vacancies and weak government procurement further pressured this sub market as new development came online in a lot of front sub markets. However, the fall-off in demand that we experienced late in Q2 did recover allowing us to achieve a fully basis point increase in sequential occupancy to 96.2%. Renewal growth moderated to 3.8% for the quarter as DC is our only market to experience an increase in year-to-date turnover. New lease pricing was a minus 2.6% driven mostly by the Central DC and the FAS [Ph] to submarkets. While all indicators signal an improving local economy, the pace of improvement is only sufficient to absorb new units at market rental rates that were below expectations. Better clarity on federal initiatives and improving job growth will be the necessary catalyst to absort future deliveries with positive late growth. New York city was stable in the quarter and continues to outperform our relatively pessimistic expectations. Today, we enjoy a very strong occupancy of 96.9% an exposure that is 30 basis points better than same week last year. Renewal increases were 3% for the quarter and combined with higher retention mitigate the minus 4.1% renewed lease over leased results that combine to achieve the positive 10 basis points revenue growth year-to-date. Compared to Q2, these results are very good as New York had more leads available in Q3 than any other quarter in 2017. Moving two sessions of one month or more are still mostly limited to new lease ups, concessions on stabilized assets across our portfolio which again are very targeted to certain properties and unit pipes ticked down slightly from $485 per move in to $436 per move in or from an average of 3.8 days to 3.5 days per move in for the quarter. Our net effective rents which factor in concessions are currently flat from the same time last year which is an improvement from last quarter when they were down 2.3% compared with the same time the previous year. Additionally, we have not the need to use non revenue incentives such as gift cards. And as a result New York City list in advertising cost are down almost 39% for the quarter. These have been positive signs thus far but we acknowledge that the market still faces a significant amount of supply and slowing job growth. For Boston, the summer student churn proved to be a little more challenging than previous years, but recovered quickly to deliver a 30 basis point quarter over quarter improvement in occupancy. Renewal growth of 5.2% was very strong in addition to 130 basis point improvement in retention. New lease pricing was positive 30 basis points for the quarter. New deliveries and downtown in Cambridge continue to weigh on new lease rents, however recent annoucments with large office space leases by Facebook, Bristol-Myers Squibb in these sub markets are encouraging for demand and above average led growth in the future. Seattle remains on track to be our top performing market and will exceed our most optimistic expectations. Renewal increases for the quarter were 7.8%, however new leased pricing weakened either in quick reaction to the news of Amazon HQ2 or due to rate pressure as new deliveries peaked in Q3. New lease rate increases were 2.6 for the quarter which was down from the 10.4% increase realized in Q2. Occupancy also dipped 50 basis points, but this reaction proved to be short lived. Today, new leased rates are now back up to 6.9% versus same week last year and renewal increases for October are 8%. They have averaged 8% going all the way back to May. Today, both occupancy at 95.7% and normal seasonal exposure are now back to the same levels that we\u2019ve experienced in 2016. Estimates are that Amazon still has approximately 10,000 new jobs to fill before they begin to level off in 2018. The Jury is still out on the full impact of the HQ2 decision, but given the City has not kept pace with infrastructure and transportation needs perhaps a few years of moderation is the best interest of everyone for the long term. Recent announcements of large office space leases other than Amazon or related entities is welcome news in the interest of a more diversified economy. More down to San Francisco, San Francisco continue to be steady through the quarter as deliveries reached their lowest level in seven quarters, while job growth was near than the national average and the lease up environment remained accommodating there was little momentum to overcome the rental rate hangover we experienced in 2016. New leased rents improved modestly resulting in a leased over lease decline of 1.9%. Renewal rates continued to improve and increase to 4.6% for the quarter. This combined with a 260 basis point increase in retention drove revenue growth of 1.6% that far exceeded our original expectation. Southern California still remains the story of submarkets and the story is playing out as we expected. The LA region downtown in Pasadena was weakest as new supply pressured new lease rents. West LA, this valley in Santa Clarita delivered exceptional results as new supply is nonexistent. Job growth remains healthy and economy that relies heavily on the film industry is being bolstered by outsized demand for original content as code cutters sneak out alternative forms of entertainment. While leased out release rates were up 80 basis points, renewal rates were up 5.9%. We also had a 100 basis point improvement in retention and a 30 basis point within occupancy. In both Orange County and San Diego, new deliveries fell off significantly in the back half of the year. This helped drive lease over lease growth of 2.3% and 2.5% respectively and renewals were second only to Seattle at 6% and 6.9% respectively. So all-in-all we had a very strong quarter, given the level of new deliveries across our markets. I am extremely proud of our team\u2019s ability to achieve the renewal results in both rate and retention and know that all of our employees out there are the secret sauce that allows us to happen. So thank you all. Mark? Mark Parrell : Thank you, David and good morning. I want to take a couple of minutes to talk today about our same store expenses, our revised full year normalized FFO guidance and our capital markets activities. Our same store expenses were up 1.7% for the third quarter and this was driven by a relatively modest increase in payroll and utilities and an increase of 2.9% in property taxes. On the plus side, the third quarter property tax increase was considerably less than we had expected due to favourable results we obtained on several property tax appeals. Our annual property tax expense guidance included an estimate of appeal success based on the many years of experience of our in house property tax team and we had a few large appeals that were resolved sooner than we had anticipated in our guidance. And as we discussed on the July call, leasing and advertising expense growth has as expected turned negative for the quarter and year-to-date , newly non-existent spending on resident gift cards as David Santee mentioned is driving the reduction. Switching to the year-to-date numbers, our same store expenses are up 2.9% for the first nine months of 2017, again increases in real-estate taxes and onside payroll continue to be the primary drivers of this growth. Same store payroll expense was up 4.7% through the first nine months of the year. As we have discussed on previous calls we continue to be impacted in this category by a combination of wage pressure to retain our property level employees in a very competitive market and the addition of staff in some markets to provide even better service to our residents and the support resident retention. These factors and a higher estimate for certain employee medical insurance and workmen\u2019s comp claims have caused us to maintain our estimate that on-site payroll will grow about 6% for the full year. We have revised our full year same store property tax expense increased guidance to 3.4% and that\u2019s down from our previous 4% to 4.5% growth expectation all for the reasons I just mentioned. This improvement in our estimate of real estate tax expense growth in turn drove the reduction and our same store expense growth guidance to 3.2% which is slightly below the low end of our previous guidance range. Moving onto normalized FFO, in our earnings release we provided a full year same store revenue increased guidance expectation of 2.2% and that\u2019s at the high end of our previous range driven by the factors that David Santee just discussed. This revenue number and our new expense growth guidance of 3.2% will lead to an increase in same store NOI of 1.8% which is slightly above the top end of our previous range. For our annual normalized FFO guidance we are picking up two pennies per share and higher property NOI with a contribution from both our better same store performance and strong performance from our leased up properties. We will see a one penny offset to this improvement due to slightly higher interest expense due to the size of our debt issuance as well as other items including a slight increase in corporate overhead. Combining all of this the result is a modest increase to our normalized FFO guidance midpoint to $3.12 per share from $3.11 per share. Now going to the balance sheet, as we discussed in our earnings release, we issued $700 million of unsecured debt in August and that consisted of $400 million of 10-year notes and $300 million of 30 year notes. Our July guidance included an assumption that we would issue about 500 million in tenure notes this year, recognizing the strength of a third year market, we decided to add a third year issuance while slightly pairing down to 10 year note issuance and indeed overall demand was exceptional for us. We were over four times oversubscribed, our tenure was down at a coupon of 3.25% and an all in rate of 3.32% and the third year has a 4% coupon and an all in effective rate of 4.11%. The third year was our lowest cost third year issuance ever and one of the lowest third year unsecured bond coupons and REIT industry history. We used the proceeds to pay down our outstanding commercial paper and revolve the balance. We thank our many strong supporters in a fixed income community for this terrific result. So all-in-all better than expected revenue, expense and NOI results, a slight increase in our normalized FFO and a very good unsecured debt issuance. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to David Neithercut. David Neithercut : All right thanks, Mark. Just a moment, a quick moment in capital allocation. As we know it in last night\u2019s press release, our transaction activity picked up some in the third quarter with the acquisition of three assets. A stabilized 301 unit property completed in 2016 in the Wiltshire Center submarket in Los Angeles was acquired for $117 million at a cap rate for 4.5%. During the quarter we also acquired two brand new assets that were both nearing completion of their initial lease up, one in Boston, 160 unit property acquired for $116 million has stabilized cap rate of 4.5%. We also acquired a 350 unit property in Bellevue, Washington for $178 million at a stabilized cap rate of 5.3. During the quarter we disposed off one asset a 120 unit property in [Indiscernible] California built in 2002 for $53 million at a disposition yield of 4.3% and we realized a 10.1% unleveraged IRR on that investment. Now at the present time we do not expect to acquire additional assets before the year is up. So as a result the $468 million acquired through the end of the third quarter will most likely be our number for the full year, but that could change if the seller needs to complete a transaction by year end and we are incentivized to help make that happen. We also continue to actively work on the disposition of a handful of assets that could close yet this year, so we have every expectation that we will get closer to the original guidance and dispositions of $500 million for the year. On the development side, in the third quarter we were very excited to essentially complete the construction on our new 398 unit high rise tower in Seattle, just two block from high place markets. Rents and absorption rates are well above our original pro forma and we expect this asset to stabilize at a yield on cost of about 5.6%. You\u2019ll note that the budget for this development has been increased by the $11.5 million and this represents changes in scope that have occurred since construction began on this asset in 2014. As rents continue to increase across the Seattle market, we were compelled to increase the quality of the unit appliance packages and the overall finishes of the property including the amenities in the common areas. We could not be more pleased with the job our team in Seattle did delivering this asset and the market reaction to it has been tremendous thus far. But during the quarter, we also completed our 178-year development in Washington DC's Mt. Vernon Triangle Submarket, this asset is also been very well received by the marketplace. Since occupancy began in June they\u2019re already 69% occupied and 80% leased as rents that are very much in line with our original expectations. We expect to realize the stabilized yield on cost of this new development of 5.7% this was a job well done by a DC team. During the third quarter we started our first new development of the year, a small one, 137 units in the Capitol Hill market in Seattle. This project has a $62 million development cost and we project a high 5% stabilized yield on cost in this transaction. And it remains possible that we will start construction and one more development project before the year is out, also small 84 units in Cambridge Massachusetts. This is adjacent to an existing 186-unit asset we have in that market in the construction budget and this deal would be about $50 million and the yield on cost currently projected in the mid-5s. So before we open the call to Q&A I just wanted [Indiscernible] one additional time on having been recently recognized by GRESB for the fourth consecutive year as a leader in environmental, social and governance performance. We take our responsibilities and our commitments on these matters quite seriously here and everyone at Equity is honored that we recognize that this year's global residential listed leader. My thanks to everyone at Equity for helping, make that happen again this year. So with that James we\u2019ll open the call to Q&A. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question today from Nick Yulico with UBS. Nick Yulico : Thanks. I wanted to start with the topic of supply. In your view is this year the peak supply impact for your markets overall? And then I was hoping to break down which cities are still are seeing your supply ease versus get worse. I think New York City, Seattle and San Francisco are couple controversial markets that come to mind? David Neithercut : Okay. Nick, this is David. I\u2019ll just kind of give you a higher, lower by market. Starting with Boston, 18 deliveries slightly lower, New York slightly higher, but -- or higher but some of that is push from 17 and 18, Washington D.C. pretty much identical to 17. San Francisco little bit lower. Seattle lower, Los Angeles significantly higher 8000 up to 14 14,500, Orange County about the same 5,000, San Diego just a little bit more at 3,500 units. Just to be clear Nick this is the way we look at the \u2013 with our competitive set those projects in these marketplaces that we look at that would compete with us. So this would not be a holistic amount across an entire marketplace, but those that are within that, so defined boundary that we look as competitive to us. Nick Yulico : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. So I guess, David putting this all together. It has been several years of him slowing growth -- revenue growth and multifamily. You\u2019ve gone to this year you're seeing some stability in your markets. There is some supply pockets of pressure still next year. Hoping to just get any earlier thought you\u2019ll be willing to share on next year and whether your same-store revenue growth could excel a great next year? And what would be a driver for that with certain markets or not? Thanks. David Neithercut : Well, I guess I would say, job with full employment it's probably difficult to expect outsized job. And then when we go across the markets we just look at where the supply is going to impact us. So, as an example Boston 50% of the new deliveries will be in the urban core and 20% are going to be in Cambridge. But there\u2019s announcements of Facebook taking a sizable office spaces in Cambridge which I discussed previously. So even though there is elevated supply there we expected to be absorbed with minimal impact to rate. You know, D.C. is really, it's pretty much everywhere, but 45% of those deliveries are very concentrated in the Riverfront D.C. Central and NoMa Submarket, so places like RBC corridor where we have little \u2013 where we have a lot of product we\u2019ll see little deliveries. Kind of going on to New York, I mean, when you look at the deliveries or even the delayed delivery, 57% of those numbers both really this year and next year are in Long Island City will we have no presence. And then Midtown West where we don't have a large presence, adding that in Jersey Waterfront is 23%, so 70%, 80% of the deliveries in New York are really not directly competing with our assets. So, I mean, I can go on through the rest of the markets, but I think that\u2019s how we\u2019re kind of looking at next year and our ability to drive rates and retain our residence and grab good renewal rate growth. Nick Yulico : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I mean, just a follow-up here. So is it, when you look at everything you look across your markets right now and everything you talked about supplies is just too early to get a read on 2018 showing you better rent growth and revenue growth for your markets? David Neithercut : It just too early, we\u2019re not prepared to give guidance at this at this juncture, Nick. Nick Yulico : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Next we\u2019ll hear from Nick Joseph with Citi. Nick Joseph : Thanks. David, you talk about the acquisitions in the third quarter, but just more broad there, are you\u2019re seeing more opportunities for acquisitions that you have over the past few years? And what do you think is driving that, if so? David Neithercut : I\u2019ll be careful with the use of the term opportunity, Nick. Are we seeing more product? No. I think the volume is, I guess, okay. It\u2019s still down from a year ago. I don't think we\u2019ve seen the same amount of product that we had seen kind of in the past. And I wouldn't characterize any of it\u2019s from an opportunity. I think there\u2019s a lot of capital that\u2019s maybe backed away maybe from core product, but there's still enough out there that what is getting done is getting done at the same kind of cap rates and valuations that we\u2019ve seen first for some time. But I would not suggest that we\u2019ve seen anything would represent as opportunities. Nick Joseph : David, you had talked with Michael Bilerman and its probably going back 18 months that there were as more merchant development or the potential for merchant development deals to start to crack and that was in the serve potential as an opportunity to put a lot of capital to work sort of within this timeframe. Is that not coming to fruition at all? David Neithercut : Well, I guess I'm not sure, my comments Michael should have interpreted expecting something to crack, but more that there just would be deals that one could acquire that been recently built that might represent better sort of risk-adjusted opportunity to deploy capital rather than develop oneself at least in the marketplace today. Now as I noted, what we acquired in the third quarter two of those were deal that had been recently completed and that were in their final stages of lease-up. So we have executed couple of those. I think we got decent going in yields relative to what stabilized product might have traded for. So I wasn\u2019t -- I'm not sure we expected anything to sort of crack, but rather there might be a flow of product. We demonstrated by buying two and my guess is that there will be opportunities for us to look at more of that product from 2018. Nick Joseph : Thanks. And then, just one more follow-up. In terms of the free cash flow for next year I think you talked about the 275 million or so. Just curious what is most attractive where we stand today for the use of that in terms of additional acquisitions, development, paying down debt, raising the dividend. Just your thoughts on that where we stand today? David Neithercut : Well, I guess, I\u2019d say, we will consider all of those, Nick. We had board meeting in September and Mark Parrell laid out that exact situation and the options we might have with that free cash flow now that our development spend has decrease considerably over the past several years. So, we\u2019ll consider when the time comes what we think is the best execution on behalf of our shareholders and won\u2019t be afraid to buy if it make sense, address the dividend if it makes sense, or think about development if it make sense. Nick Joseph : Thank you. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll hear from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Rich Hightower : Hi. Good morning guys. David Neithercut : Good morning, Rich. Rich Hightower : I wanted to quickly follow-up on Nick Yulico\u2019s question about New York. Just with respect to your outlook for submarket supply next year, but does your experience in 2016 where I think you sort of discovered that renters were submarket agnostic in many ways in New York. Does that sort of temper your view on what New York could be next year in terms of rent growth despite the fact that you're fairly well protected from a submarket perspective currently? David Neithercut : Well, I think the biggest most obvious discussion for our portfolio would be Long Island City and we just haven't seen \u2013 our concern was with value hunters be willing to move out of the city into Long Island City for a better value. And we just really haven't seen that materialized. And then when you look at a big portion of what's being delivered in Brooklyn is further east. Brooklyn pretty much held up reasonably well for us. So we don't see a big chunk of these new deliveries next year really impacting us if the market continues to be disciplined the way it has this year. Rich Hightower : Okay. That's helpful. And then back to third quarter results really quickly in Seattle. So pretty strong on the rent growth side, but there was a pretty significant delta between rent growth and in total revenue growth. Can you tell us what was going on in some of those other revenue categories during the third quarter in Seattle? Mark Parrell : Hey, Rich, it\u2019s Mark Parrell. So just going over to the quarter-over-quarter numbers and giving you a little bit of background. Average rental rate physical occupancy and turnover are all numbers we compute solely with regards to the residential portfolio which is 96 plus percent of our income. We do have as you know, retail in the base of our buildings as tenant amenities dry cleaners and the like. That number that we report, the revenue number for the quarter for Seattle which was 4.9%, that number does include retail garage than anything else. So we had some retail vacancy in the third quarter in Seattle. We also had some stuff that was really a timing issue that will correct itself in the fourth quarter. So if you would've look at that number, 4.9 it would have in the 6% number just on residential. But again it's not anything particularly material and a great deal that will reverse itself in the fourth quarter. Rich Hightower : That\u2019s perfect. Thanks Mark. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll move to Conor Wagner with Street Advisors. Conor Wagner : Good morning. David Neithercut : Good morning, Conor. Conor Wagner : David Santee on the bay area can you give us some color on the difference between the performance in Oakland, San Francisco and then San Jose? David Santee : Sure. So we don't have anything in Oakland. Conor Wagner : I mean the East Bay in general. David Santee : Okay. So, the downtown market continues to be under pressure. That is the b bottom performing submarket. The best performance is in the Peninsula, and then East Bay, South Bay, Berkeley kind of all in between, but very similar. Conor Wagner : Okay. And then in South Bay, that's your in San Jose there in Silicon Valley? David Santee : Yes. Conor Wagner : Okay. And then on that transaction activity, David Nethercutt, can you just remind me, the numbers you are putting in cap rates, is that one year forward nominal or on the lease-up what rent is that on? Is that on the assumption of stabilization? David Neithercut : The transactions that are stabilized that would be our forward 12 across the acquisition. And on the lease-up it would be the second 12 month period of ownership. Conor Wagner : And on that second 12 month are you assuming some rent growth in that interim period? Or is that based on today's rents? David Neithercut : Depending on the marketplace it would either be \u2013 that could include some combination of burn off of perhaps what the developer might offered in concessions, as well as some sort of rent growth. Yes, there would be some view as to what would be taking place on the rent side in that second 12 month period. Conor Wagner : Okay, great. Thank you very much. David Neithercut : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Juan Sanabria : Hi. Good morning. I was just hoping you could talk to the concession environment for lease-up across your major markets and whether you've seen any step up in the amount of free rent or other forms of concessions into the fourth quarter today? David Santee : Juan, its David Santee. As far as concessions on lease-up, I mean, it\u2019s been very stable and within expectations places like Seattle, even our Brannan deal in Downtown San Francisco. We had very strong demand, so we didn't come out of the chute with the standard one month concession. And everywhere else it's pretty consistently. I mean, there's not no markets that are giving more than one month on lease-up at least in the lease for our portfolio and we don't we haven't seen any change through the peak season. Juan Sanabria : So its fair to say you aren't seeing the same panic that we saw in 2016 at least to date despite the peak supply at this point in 2017? David Santee : Not even close, no, very stable. Juan Sanabria : Okay. And then just on the new lease growth. Could you give us a sense of the trend throughout the third quarter, and kind of where you are fourth quarter to date for the portfolio as a whole? David Neithercut : Well, all I could give you today would be kind of a snapshot of our market rents relative to our exposure and today across the portfolio, market rents versus the same week last year are up about 2.5% which bodes very well considering we\u2019re in the entering the slower time of the year. Juan Sanabria : And the churn on the new lease signed during the third quarter decelerate throughout the third quarter given seasonality? David Neithercut : Well, I guess that would be a market by market discussion, but I gave you all of the Q3 lease over lease numbers in my prepared remarks. Juan Sanabria : Great. Thanks. And one last quick one from me, any reason for that we saw a couple of development delays in the expected delivery dates, any reason for that it seem to be more on the West Coast? David Santee : Well, there is several reasons. I can tell you that our property in San Francisco our Brannan asset is just having some issues getting sufficient labor to close out the last 122 or so units on that property. And then on property cascade in Seattle, we had some issues completing some of the exterior work because of some work that we'd be done \u2013 being done across the street that was sort of closing down some streets or some sidewalks that caused delay. But its very important sort of note with respect to these two deals. Each of them have been pushed back maybe one or maybe one a couple of orders, but that did not push back at all the date upon which those properties were first made available for lease. So I think it\u2019s a very important thing we get ask a lot of questions about what's happening with \u2013 is your performance and the result of property being pushed back or completion being pushed back and this is a perfect example of why we don\u2019t really pay a lot of attention to those being pushed back. These deals were pushed back but did not affect when they open and available in the marketplace, and it will not affect the overall leasing velocity and overall performance of these assets despite that one being pushed back a quarter and I think being pushed back a couple of quarters. Juan Sanabria : Thank you. David Santee : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Dennis McGill with Gilman Associates has our next question. Dennis McGill : Hi. Thank you, guys. First one, just for the portfolio as a whole do you have the new on the renewal rate increases in third quarter? Sorry if I missed it. Mark Parrell : The renewal for the portfolio was 47 and the lease over lease was minus 90 basis poins. Dennis McGill : Okay, great. Thank you. And just back to the supply conversation. When you noted the different increases across markets are increases or decreases, as you said, it was on how you define the boundaries and what\u2019s competitive with you. Can you maybe just elaborate on how you do define those boundaries? Is it a distance from the property? Is it qualitative at the market level? Any thoughts there would be helpful? David Neithercut : Well, I think if you look at some of the data stops, they\u2019re using the statistical MSA which if you use New York as an example goes all the way down to almost Philadelphia far west into New Jersey, further up into outer New York almost Connecticut. And in our portfolio in New York is really Manhattan, a little bit on the Jersey waterfront and then a little bit in Brooklyn. So we just kind of draw a circle around all of that and focus on the deliveries within that boundary. This year or last year we decided to include Long Island city which really is a different price point probably a different -- a little bit different demographic knowing that new submarket could draw residents from the city. So, I think we\u2019re very conservative in giving ourselves, being intellectually honest withdrawing these boundaries plus we\u2019re going all the way down to kind of five level \u2013 five-unit communities, so we\u2019re including everything knowing that anything that's on the market for lease could impact demand in our footprint. Dennis McGill : So that the radius of that circle is defined at each level with the local teams, or is there uniform definition? David Neithercut : Yes. Dennis McGill : Okay. David Neithercut : So, we \u2013 go ahead. Dennis McGill : Okay. So on New York specifically earlier you had said in New York that the supply in 2018 would be slightly higher, I think are higher versus 2017. But then later you said that about 80% of what's being delivered is not directly competing with your assets? So the increase encompassing some of those areas like Long Island city that you mentioned are not directly competing or is that slight increase versus 2017 just in your competitive set? David Neithercut : So the increase in New York for 2018, some of that is a push going back back to that delayed units, it's you probably couple thousand units that are being moved from 2017 in the 2018. Now when you look at where all of these deliveries are, the largest concentration and when I say concentration I mean literally within a couple of blocks of each other. 57% of the number for 2018 is 19,000 units. So 57% of those 19,000 units are predominantly in Long Island city and Far East and North Brooklyn. Okay. So we have probably four smaller assets in Brooklyn. We have nothing in Long Island city, but we have incorporated that into our own customized but competitive set knowing that because of the value opportunity in Long Island city that some folks could [Indiscernible] to save on rent. Dennis McGill : Okay. That makes sense. And then I\u2019m just venting [ph] to compare against? Mark Parrell : Well, we started out the year with I think a little above 15 and now were down to 13\u2026 David Neithercut : It\u2019s about 15 to\u2026 Mark Parrell : 15 to 17 and 19 for 18 [ph], yes Dennis McGill : Okay, great. Thank you, guys. Good luck. Mark Parrell : And I\u2019ll just, before we go to next question, I had one little other piece of information to you Dennis with respect to that lease over lease. The number that David gave you 90 basis points is our total lease over lease. 12 month lease expiring over a 12 month lease which's been writing is half that amount, so it's about negative 40 basis. David Neithercut : Right. Operator : Next over here from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning. Dave, just going back to the comments on the lack of opportunity from the Merchant, you had to pick up deals from the Merchant guy. Is that, you think that's more just where your portfolio is in terms of timing of deliveries and maybe those deals that you thought would crack this year getting delayed until next year or is it something else going on. Because obviously from some of your peers, they've said differently. So, I'm trying to figure out if it's deals getting pushed that's causing the lack of opportunity versus literally in your markets, it's just you're not seeing it because of capital flows et cetera? David Neithercut : I guess, it's perhaps all of the above, Alex. And again, I'm not sure that I ever implied there is going to be some tsunami wave of these deals coming but you also many of these markets see them all going up and our expectations is over some accretive time. May not, maybe that's some of them had been delayed because construction has been delayed, some maybe want to get stabilized, maybe some have got some institutional capital it's willing to sit for several year. I mean, it's all of the above. But we certainly will expect to see some of those brought to market as I know we bought two. So, certainly they, some of them are already are being brought to market. I'm sure we've underwritten scheds more than just the two that we've acquired and I'm sure that we will look at more yes this year and certainly into 2018. But I'm not so sure that there is any reason why there's a fewer today that I may have led you to believe when we talked about this pool of potential investment opportunities have on horizon. We're looking at them, we bought a couple and we'll certainly look at more. But I don\u2019t think there's been any change necessarily in the flow of that product. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then, David Santee, when we look at Seattle, I mean, clearly Amazon's been the 800 gorilla as far as job worth and expansion, in all facets. But at the property level, are your teams seeing just predominantly Amazon employees or companies that are spawned because of Amazon or it's a view that there is sufficient other tech growers and other companies that are going to Seattle that even if Amazon dials back there's still sufficient demand. I'm just trying to get a sense from you guys from what you're hearing from your local teams how much of an impact they think it's going to have? David Santee : Well, I mean obviously the closer you are to closer to property is to it sounds like giving in the more it's going to be influenced by Amazon. But we have a wide range of people living with the works for different employers but again I mean we measure that every so often but it's not necessarily concerning at any one community. I guess that's all I could give you for now. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then just final question. I just saw the news item on the litigation or I guess class action whatever in California. Is there anything that you can provide some more color on this or perspective? David Neithercut : Well, 2014 a lawsuit was brought against us because of our late rate late payments and process and procedures and I will just sort of tell you things like this and sort of standard operating procedure for a company like us and particularly in complex in California. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. I appreciate it, thank you. Good luck. David Neithercut : Very welcome, Alex. Operator : Next we'll hear from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Thanks, good morning. David Neithercut : Good morning. John Kim : In Seattle, David Santee referenced Amazon HQ2 and its impact on new leases. But I was wondering with that announcement in combination with the approval of a new municipal income tax because that's impacted your underwriting for Seattle investments going forward. David Neithercut : Well, we haven\u2019t, we're not really underwriting anything new at this point in time. But we certainly there have been numerous city council initiatives what have you that involves fees and taxes and we always update those items when we are underwriting either an acquisition or a new development. David Santee : Yes. David's comments about HQ2 weren't specifically citing that but just mentioning that we did see a little kind of wobble if you will of some of our pricing around that time. But as you also noted in his prepared remarks, the markets recover and he's now operating the same levels that it had from most of this summer. But certainly as we think about looking at Seattle which represents maybe only 8% or 9% of our NOI, we take all of these things into consideration, the impact of gorillas like Amazon and Microsoft and issues with fees and regulations and all those things will be part of what we'll consider is we underwrite the future cash flow streams of the assets we want to either build or acquire. John Kim : Okay. Next question maybe Amazon related. But on the discussion of wage pressure, can you just clarify is this the direct result of new multi dynamic supply and also there was some commentary on additional staff needed to provide better service. And I was wondering if that was in relation to packets delivered? Mark Parrell : Hey John, it's Mark. Some of this is just wage growth as we said because there are wage pressures in the field. But there also are and we mentioned this on the prior earnings call as well, some adjustments that we are making that are very hard for us to predict. To work means comp and medical insurance reserves, we are self-insured. So, as a result of that when those items run through the numbers, they can impact on the margin a bit. So, when you look at what's going on and we talk about a 6% number for the year, a fair amount of that kind of part over 4% is probably driven by these workman's comp and medical insurance reserve adjustments that we made the last few quarters. And that we're making estimates up in the fourth quarter that could change a fair amount. We're wrong, that number could be a fair amount lower than 6% or a bit higher, it's just very hard for us to pack. John Kim : Thanks, Mark. And any commentary on additional staff needed? David Neithercut : Well, I think, I mean we targeted several of our larger buildings or buildings that were across the street from one and other that we may have used one manager to run two or three buildings and we felt that in this very competitive environment we want to make sure that our residents were being serviced that we had appropriate resources to administer our renewal programs, to ensure the sales were in tip top shape. And when we discussed that at the beginning of the year, most of that was put in place and we really have it made any further adjustments since then. We don\u2019t see we have not really added staffing solely because of packages. We are more focused on 24/7 package rooms that we have been extremely focused on delivering to our employees this year. So, I mean when you look at the wage growth wage pressure, with the retail slowdown however you want it to categorize what's going on with retail, office employees are not really that under pressure. It's more on the service side, the guys that know how to fix refrigerators and HVACs and what have you. So, we feel good about the changes that we made year-to-date for the most part where pretty stable right now. John Kim : Thank you. David Neithercut : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird. Drew Babin : Good morning. David Neithercut : Good morning. Drew Babin : Have you heard anecdotally from a couple of your peers that the bay area's maybe benefit as a little more than other markets from construction delays over our competitive supply this year. I just wanted to ask A) is that accurate with what through second system with what you're seeing in the Bay area. And B) what sub markets maybe benefitting the most from projects being pushed out in the next year? David Santee : Well again, I mean, I know there was a large buyer in the East Bay in a new development that certainly would help the East Bay. David just discussed our experience at our Brannan property in downtown. But again the fire certainly is taking something out of the mix and pushing it out another year or two. But we have not seen anything that is categorized as delayed but has not begun to lease up. So, the units coming to market are still coming to market as we expected when we began the year. David Neithercut : Yes. And just to reiterate what we said earlier. Just because projects are being quote-and-quote delayed from their final completion, does not mean their doors did not open for occupancy when originally expected and certainly they begin marketing those units 60, 90 days in advance. So, just because something gets quote-on-quote sort of delayed or its completion gets pushed back, it does not mean it was not in the competitive set during the third quarter. That was possible but it's just and in our own experience it's been on two deals that on this press release we're notifying you for the first time have been delayed, their doors were open as we expected and first occupancies took place as we expected and the delays did not impact any of that. So, we'll just use that as an example of being careful about drawing too much out of the fact that things have completions have been pushed back. Drew Babin : That's helpful, thanks for that. And I'm also to some Merchant did this year, there's been a lot of more discipline in the market obviously with the concessions and things like that with your competitive set. How much of that would you attribute to kind of earlier this year maybe interest rate expectations being reigned in a little bit. Is anything changing or do you expect anything to change, should depend your treasury creep up over the next couple of quarters. Which will determine that? David Neithercut : I guess I'm not sure I understand about maybe you can rephrase that for me, Drew? Drew Babin : Sure. The questions really on the correlation between kind of the urgency of merchant builders to lease up their properties and interest for short term interest rates because your interest costs are going up now. David Neithercut : Oh, I see. Okay, I got it. So, with respect to the urgency. I think what we saw a year ago primarily in San Francisco was people could cut rents from the marketplace and still exceed the original expectations of other rental levels, that's not the case now. I think that people that rent today are in the ballpark of what people underwrote and they have to preserve try those levels. And so, they have to be disciplined with respect to achieving those. And I think that may very well explain what we're seeing this year relative to what we saw in San Francisco a year ago. Drew Babin : Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you. David Neithercut : So, it's less the financing market and more just where rents are today relative to their original pro formas. Drew Babin : Okay, great. Thank you. David Neithercut : You're very welcome. Operator : Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank has the next question. Vincent Chao : Hey everyone. I know this is probably more of a regional impact but just curious given that there has been labor shortages already from the natural disasters we saw this fall. I was just curious if there is any noticeable change in that dynamic post some of the hurricanes? Mark Parrell : We've had labor challenges particularly on the construction side across all of our markets and those continues. I noted actually in San Francisco our Brannan property has been in the last 120 so wide units have been delayed because of this challenge is getting people on site. I have not heard anyone attribute any marginal worsening of that problem because resources have been deployed in taxes of our floor. So, I can't tell you that's the case but we continue to just see labor shortages and our contractors whereas our tradesman are all kind of continuing to sing the blues in that regard. But haven\u2019t heard anyone suggest it that's got worse because of the hurricanes. Vincent Chao : Okay, thanks for that. And then just maybe from guidance from the same store revenue I mean just seem like there is an implied a modest flourishment in the fourth quarter. Is that really just a reflection of the timing of some of this supply that had there really expected some was getting pushed out maybe into the fourth quarter from the third? Mark Parrell : Again it's Mark Parrell. I mean, no just the map here means that in the fourth quarter, our quarter-over-quarter number could be anywhere from 1.9% to 2.3% and still map out to the two two number that we put out to you. And really it's very small changes in occupancy and as we said a moment ago, we're really not buyers in the thesis that there are delays that are meaningful in deliveries that are impacting our numbers. So, there is a margin air in these numbers but we would generally expect the number in the fourth quarter that we report quarter-over-quarter to be reasonably consistent with third quarter number or quarter-over-quarter that we just reported. Vincent Chao : Okay, thank you. Mark Parrell : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley. Richard Hill : Hey, I guess it's still good morning for you guys. Hey, just a quick question on the tax appeals. I want to make sure, was that related to the LA market and can we attribute that to the sharp declines and expenses that we saw this quarter? Mark Parrell : There is two markets were impacted by the appeals in the same store set New York and LA. Richard Hill : Understood, thank you. And are there any other markets where you have ongoing appeals right now? Mark Parrell : We have ongoing appeals in every market. And we underwrite and try and guess and it's really a very good educated guess as to how many of those appeals wind up getting recognized as income received or reduction of our taxes. But it's an estimate and sometimes things happen a little faster or a little slower than we expect. Richard Hill : Got it. And then on your FFO guide increase, you noted that it was a combination of tax appeals and NOIs. Do you have a breakdown or can you provide any guidance of how we should be thinking about the benefit of tax appeal versus the NOI growth? Mark Parrell : I think you can think about the tax appeal as worth give or take $2 million and then the rest of it is a combination of revenue being better than we thought in the same store set and non-same store predominant lease up income being better than we thought. Richard Hill : Great, thank you very much. I appreciate it. That's all. Mark Parrell : You're very welcome, Rich. Operator : Next we'll hear from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Tayo Okusanya : Yes, first for all congrats on a great quarter. Following-up on Rich's question, how do we start to I know again you're not giving a lot of insight into 18 yet. But from an operating expense perspective, how do we kind of start thinking about kind of same store FX growth kind of on a regular run rate basis, these to kind of say an opportunity it's kind of keep driving things down or this quarter was specifically unusual and you expect a higher run rate going forward for same store FX was? David Santee : So, this is David Santee. I think we've kind of talked previously that real-estate taxes are a big driver. It's 40% of our total operating expense and one of the key inputs to that are the increases or the step ups in our 421-a in New York which will add probably a 150 basis point to normalize real-estate tax growth up through 2020. So, for the past several quarters or year we've talked about real-estate tax growth of 4% to 5% up through 2020. And then everything else is payroll is obviously our second biggest expense group wage pressures this year. We probably would expect a little bleed in the next year. And then utilities we are trying to or making investments into LED lighting, a lot of energy conservation. At the same time, we kind of try to lock in future natural gas prices that add significant discounts year-over-year. So, all in all I mean I think expenses going forward, we kind of always said three handle. Tayo Okusanya : Got you. Okay, that's helpful. And I know this is not part of your normalized FFO per share number but could you talk about the legal settlements during the quarter what that was about? David Neithercut : Sure. That was a construction defect lawsuit and lawyers were able to resolve in a favorable way for us. So, we received the money and you can't capitalize it, it has to go through an income account. And so we do exclude it from normalized FFO even though it's a benefit. Tayo Okusanya : Got you. Thank you, very much. David Neithercut : You're welcome. Operator : Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets has our next question. Wes Golladay : Hi, good morning guys. Could you guys give us the new rent growth for October yet? David Neithercut : No, we did not. We do not have that number. Wes Golladay : Okay. And then looking at the Seattle market, you mentioned the supply will be down next year. In particular I see looking at hosted date of the CBD would be arriving next year. Do you agree with that and how do you view your trade area, do you lump it together as Queen Anne -- like Union or just a little bit more color on how you see supply going down? David Santee : So almost all of the delivery in 2018 is going to be in downtown CBD. So that is compared to this year, it\u2019s a pretty meaningful reduction, relative to what was delivered this year in North Seattle. I mean the bulk of it is really CBD. David Neithercut : And we do consider all those areas within our competitive sort of trade areas, they are going back to the conversation about sort of the boundaries, Belltown, Queen Anne, downtown Salt Lake Union Capital Hill, Belleview -- I mean they are all considered part of that trade area. Wes Golladay : [Indiscernible] sorry go ahead. You go finish, sorry about that. David Neithercut : No it\u2019s just \u2013 since its a trade area, I just want to make it clear that area that we consider new product being built to compete with us, so that would, all those markets would be included in that area. Wes Golladay : No I\u2019d just say then that you guys have walked all those areas, the sights right. I believe you mentioned on the last call. David Neithercut : Our local teams? David Neithercut : Oh yes, my guys certainly are tracking all those things, they now examine, we\u2019ve got platforms you can go online and see every potential site who owns it, what\u2019s being contemplated to be built, when our teams expect it to start, when our teams expect it to be not just completed but available for occupancy and they track all that information absolutely. Wes Golladay : Okay, thank you. David Neithercut : You\u2019re very welcome. Operator : That will conclude the question and answer session. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Neithercut for any additional closing comments. David Neithercut : Yeah well thank you everybody. We\u2019ll see a lot of you in Dallas next month. Thanks for your time this morning. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

David Neithercut : Thank you, Marty. Good morning everybody. Thank you for joining us for today's call. We are pleased to have delivered operating and financial results for 2017 that were at the high end of our original expectations for the year. Now obviously a lot of things had to go right for us to do so, because it required every market to achieve our absolute best case level of performance for the year and stayed one that\u2019s pretty much exactly what happened. Naturally as we began the year we were quite cautious, about the elevated levels of new supply across our markets, which had begun to impact landlords pricing power in 2016, ending several years of above trend performance that had been driven by extremely favorable supply and demand conditions, as we emerged from the last downturn. However, while revenue growth certainly slowed as compared to prior years, several factors allowed us to mitigate the impact of this new supply and outperform our original expectations. First as everyone is keenly aware, there is clearly very deep and very resilient demand for apartment living in our urban and highly walkable suburban markets, which continue to be powered by an expanding economy, which has driven employment -- unemployment to record lows and is ignited wage growth that had been dormant for much of the recovery. As David Santee will explain in more detail in just a moment, the second factor for our success in 2017 was the relentless focus on our prospects, our residence and our properties, by our property management and operational teams and everyone else across our enterprise that supports those teams. Our 2017 performance was the result of everyone, working as one team, providing remarkable service to our residents and sweating every detail. This was a job very well done across the enterprise and I'm extremely proud and honored to give a hardy shout out to the mall. However, we don\u2019t get to celebrate our successes for too long, because as these teams know all too well, 2018 will bring more of the same. New supply will continue to be delivered across our markets, which will continue to pressure new lease rates, occupancy and retention. Fortunately all signals continue to point to further economic expansion, corporate earnings continue to grow and the corporate tax cuts are encouraging companies to deploy capital and increase wages, which are very, very good signs for the apartment business. There is no question that demand for our high quality rental properties will continue to be extremely strong. Our residents will see their wages increase and will have more after-tax money in their pockets, as a result of the new tax act, while still being disinterested or unable to afford single-family homes the cost at which continue to rise in our already high single-family market, high cost of housing markets. It won\u2019t be easy, but you can count on EQR teams across the country to continue to perform at highest levels and deliver optimum results in the New Year. David Santee will now go into more detail of our 2017 results, and how we expect our markets to perform in 2018. And then Mark Parrell, will give some color on operating expenses, our earnings guidance for the year, and the various assumption that support this guidance. David? David Santee : Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. A year ago, when we laid out our guidance for 2017, I told you that our teams are keenly aware of the challenges before us, and I was 100% confident that they would go above and beyond to deliver in 2017. They did and I'd like to recognize those efforts, which allowed us to keep revenue growth at the high-end of our original guidance and expense growth that came in well below the bottom end of our guidance. In a new supply environment like this one, we know that our customers have many choices, but despite these above-average levels of new supply across all of our markets, our teams were able to deliver 4.6% renewal rate growth, while achieving the lowest resident turnover in the history of our company. They also continued to improve our customer loyalty scores, which have increased 25% over the last couple of years. And we did this while, also seeing our employee engagement scores remain at peak levels and our property employee turnover decline. Our wining culture and the desire to deliver our best will be called upon once again in 2018, as we face another year of elevated supply. And so our 2,000 operating strategy is very simple. Hit the replay button and keep a laser focus on our customers and employees. Renew and retain combined with market pricing discipline will be the key drivers in our ability to deliver 2018 revenue results that are very similar to 2017. Now moving on to the markets, I\u2019ll focus my comments on the assumptions that make up our full-year forecast on a market-by-market basis. These include new lease growth rates, the expected renewal rates achieved and the percent of contribution to same store revenue growth that together get into the midpoint of our full-year guidance. I'll also discuss what we see in the markets today and provide color on the new deliveries and how much or little we expect them to impact us based on our geographic footprint. So I will start with the markets and we expect to have the most positive impact to our 2018 revenue growth and finish up with New York, which will have a negative impact. Before I get to the specific markets, a note on the impact of tax reform, while it\u2019s too early to make any conclusions about the impact of the new tax plan, our map in both California and New York, our average single resident will be saving about $2,000 annually and our average married couple about $3,500 annually. Also the new reforms appear to make homeownership look marginally more expensive.  First, Los Angeles, which produced 3.6% revenue growth in 2017, which was in line with our original expectation. We got there from better than expected renewal growth, which offset lower than expected gains on new leases. In 2018, we expect Los Angeles to produce revenue growth of about 3.25% for the year and contribute approximately 35% of our portfolio wide revenue growth. With the national economy appearing to be firing on all cylinders, LA is expected to see improved job growth in 2018, which should help drive strong absorption of the estimated 14,000 new deliveries. Announcements by Amazon, Apple and others have taken again larger chunks of office space in Cargo [ph] City bode well for both downtown and West LA. With the favorable geographic mismatch in the new supply versus our footprint, we are forecasting 96% occupancy, 5.2% renewal rate growth and new lease gain of 75 basis points. West LA, the North, and East suburbs will be the strongest as these submarkets will see virtually no new supply. Downtown, Koreatown and up through Glendale past [indiscernible] we\u2019ll see the bulk of all deliveries, however at a much higher price point to much of our existing portfolio. In 2017, San Francisco produced 2.2% revenue growth, which was better than we expected, but not beyond what we thought could happen. The growth here was again proved better than expected renewal growth. In 2018, San Francisco appears to be on very solid ground and takes the number two position contributing 20% to 2018 revenue growth, with total new deliveries on par with 2017, and spread similarly across the same submarkets. Very strong demand has positioned us for good start to the year. With the new corporate tax plan taking hold, many announcements of tech expansion in the Peninsula and South Bay San Jose are very encouraging for maintaining solid absorption. With deliveries front loaded for the year and current occupancy better by 60 basis points versus last year, we checkmark San Francisco as the market that has the most potential to surprise to the upside. Our 2018 forecast has this market producing revenue growth of approximately 1.75% with occupancy for the full year at 95.8%, renewals up 4.1% versus the 4.3% growth in 2017 and flat growth on new leases versus the negative 1.7% for 2017. On to Seattle, where the 5.6% revenue growth we produced in 2017, driven by good absorption of new supply, candidly [ph] be cautious forecast. We saw both new leases and renewals in this market perform better than expected in 2017. Now in 2018 Seattle will be our third largest contributor to growth at 16%, driven mostly by our strong embedded growth in the ramp up. But as we start 2018 we are more cautious as a result of the concentrated and elevated supply in all of the urban submarkets and the persistent moderation of new lease rent since the announcement of HQ2.  In Q4 2017, rumors of hiring freeze at Amazon appear to play out with the number of job openings hitting their lowest level in years at 3,000. As recent as last week however, open jobs have rebounded to 3,600 and demand in the recent weeks has been good or average, but is yet to be consistent week over week. Occupancy and exposure are on top of last year however notable moderation in new lease ramp remains. With that said, our forecast for 2018 is for this market to produce revenue growth of 3.25% versus the 5.6% growth we achieved last year. For 2018 we\u2019re budgeting new lease growth up 70 basis points, we\u2019re holding occupancy flat, renewals up 5.4% versus the 2017 achieved growth of 7.5%. The Washington DC was the only market in our portfolio that did not meet or beat our expectations in 2017. We produced revenue growth of 1.3% in DC in 2017 as the uncertainty in the market caused by the political environment slowed activity early in the year. In 2018 DC is expected to contribute 11% of our revenue growth as the continued improvement in economic conditions is only sufficient to absorb the level of new deliveries at flat to slightly negative rental rates. With federal government, which makes up a third of the metro economy not growing the private sector will need to be the fuel that creates outsize demand, a necessary variable to achieve rent growth that is closer to long-term averages. With almost 12,000 new units expected, the concentrations in the district submarkets of Nomad, Central DC and the Riverfront will continue to pressure new lease rents in much of our footprint. The RBC Corridor and Alexandria will see little new supply this year and that should add some stability to full year revenue growth. Our expectation for 2018 is revenue growth of 1%. We expect occupancy to be flat at 96.1, renewals the same as 2017 up 4.1% and slight improvement to new lease gain at negative 1.9% versus the negative 3% we realized in 2017. In 2017 Boston produced revenue growth of 1.6% in line with our expectations. We did better than we expected on renewals and occupancy, which offset some softness in rates. In 2018 we expect Boston to contribute 10% of our revenue growth and like last year Boston will deliver 4,500 new units spread across the same metro submarkets with a slight increase in Cambridge. The City will see deliveries front loaded, while Cambridge is back loaded and expected to have a greater impact in 2018. Good news continues to be abundant in Boston as many of the large technology and biotech firms continue to take down large swaps of office space, as well as companies like Phillips who are relocating headquarters. All told 2,000 high paying jobs will be moving to Cambridge alone, which should continue to support good absorption rates with minimal pricing power on new leases.  We expect this market to produce revenue growth of 1.6% this year similar to what it delivered in 2017. Forecast for 2018 hold occupancy flat at 95.8%, renewals slightly less than 2017 up 4.3% with marginal improvement in new lease gains of minus 1% versus minus 1.7% in 2017.  Orange County and San Diego are two smallest NOI markets. Both had very good years in 2017 delivering revenue growth of 4.7% and 4.6% respectively. Again better than expected renewal growth and occupancy led the way in these markets. In 2018 they should produce our best revenue growth, but due to their size will contribute the least to our overall growth at 9% each. Orange County will see a slight reduction in new deliveries that will come online evenly across next four quarters, while San Diego will see an increase of 3,700 deliveries that are front loaded. New deliveries in absolute term should be easily absorbed without pricing disruption, steady job growth coupled with increase in single family home prices continues to fuel demand in excess of supply that allow these two markets to achieve above average trend revenue growth. We expect both markets to deliver 4% revenue growth in 2018. Occupancy forecast for both markets are 96.2% with renewals up 5.9% and 5.4% for Orange County and San Diego respectively. New lease growth is expected to be 2.1% and 2.2% respectively. And then closing with the Big Apple, in 2017 this market exceeded our expectations by producing revenue growth of 10 basis points. Driving by a less use of confessions than expected as well as better than expected renewal growth and occupancy. We continue to be very pleased with the pricing discipline that the market showed in 2017 and that we continue to see today. In 2018, this market will deliver elevated supply approximately 19,000 units in our competitive footprint. 62% of this new supply is in Long Island City and Brooklyn. As we've discussed previously the unknown in New York City is at the level of new supply in Long Island City will begin to attract meaningful demand for Manhattan. Long Island City we see around 4,000 new units come online in the first half of the year with total expected 2018 deliveries of a little more than 6,200 new partners. Brooklyn, a more desirable burrow will almost 4,800 new units with over 1,800 in downtown and 1,400 in Williamsburg. East Brooklyn will see 1,300 new units that are counted separately from Brooklyn. Brooklyn has developed into a destination location and its downtown has been completely transformed. But it only grew for Manhattan lenders seeking value, while Long Island City is far behind in neighborhood amenities and night life. The risk of increasing concessions and the potential to bleed into Manhattan pricing is only one great stop away. A short train ride for a 15% to 20% discount on risk on rent is a risk that we cannot yet quantify. Manhattan alone has almost 4,000 new units coming online in Midtown West and Gramercy and the Hudson Waterfront Jersey City sub market another 2,000. With peak supply in 2018 and job growth for the year forecast to be below 2017 levels, we continue to be cautious for New York. We expect to produce same store revenue of minus 75 basis points in this market in 2018, which will results in New York making a negative contribution of 10% to our portfolio wide revenue growth. Occupancy forecast is 96.1%, renewals at up 2.5% and new leases at minus 3.7%, which is a 50 basis point improvement to 2017. We were conservative in our estimate in regards to the amount of concession we thought we would have to use in 2017 and ended up using less than we budgeting. We begin 2018 with the similar level of conservatism on concessions. In closing, all of our markets will see alleviative levels of new supply, but demand remains very good. Job growth continue to be solid and we are optimistic that the new tax plan will be a very good stimulus to improving the overall economy and the incomes of our customers. Our employees are some of the best and brightest out there and they know how to do things right. But more importantly when to do the right things for our customers and our business that in the end will produce optimal results for our shareholder. And again a big shout out to all of our employees out there, I know that you can hit that reply button and do it again in 2018. Mark? Mark Parrell : Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. And I want to take a few minutes this morning to talk today about our same store expense, normalized FFO and capital expenditure guidance for 2018. Before I launch into some detail on our 2018 same store expense guidance range of 3.5% to 4.5% I want to give some context. Our lower than expected full year 2017 same store expense increase of 2.7% versus the 3.2% that we expected has set up a relatively difficult comparable period for 2018.  We have also benefited from a modest 2.7% average annual growth rate of same store expenses over the past five years. Switching now to 2018, our same store expense growth this year will be driven as it usually is by growth in our big three expense lines, real estate taxes, on-site payroll and utilities, which together constitute almost 80% of our total same store expenses. On the real estate tax side, we expect an increase of between 4.75% and 5.75% with about 170 basis points of the increase coming from the 421-a burn off in New York.  We face the tough comp in 2018, as we had better than expected success in some appeals in 2017, that brought the full year growth rate down to 3.2%, now is about 100 basis points lower than we originally thought back in February of 2017. Jurisdictions with the largest expected real estate tax expense increase in New Jersey and New York. For payroll expense, we expect an increase of around 5%, as we face continued pressure to retain our property level employees, especially in regards to maintenance salaries, which we see up over 6%, all in a very competitive labor market.  Switching to utilities, we anticipate an increase of between 3% and 4% in 2018, after some very good years in this category you might recall we were up 2% in 2017, and we had decreases in both 2016 and 2015. We are now facing a tough comp and increases in trash and natural gas costs. So now move over to normalized FFO guidance. Our range for normalized FFO for 2018 is $3.17 to $3.27 per share. Comparing our 2017 normalized FFO guidance of $3.13 per share to the $3.22 midpoint of our 2018 guidance, the major drivers are first, our portfolio of nine properties, totaling about 3,200 units in various stages of lease up, should create about $71 million in normalized FFO. As compared to 2017, this is an incremental contribution to our results of about $35 million or $0.09 per share. Second, we expect to have a positive impact of about $0.04 per share from same store NOI growth in 2018 and offsetting this will be a reduction of about $4 million or $0.01 per share from our 2017 and 2018 transaction activity. Our guidance assumes that dispositions are relatively front end loaded, while acquisitions are relatively backend loaded. Also on a negative side, we estimate an impact of about $4.4 million, and that approximates $0.01 per share from higher total interest expense, while we will benefit from our prepayment activity in issuance of new data at lower coupons, we will feel a large negative impact from significantly lower capitalized interest this year, because most of our development projects had now been placed in the service, as well as higher expected rates on our variable rate debt. We\u2019ll also have a negative impact of about $0.02 per share from other items, including higher general and administrative costs and property management costs. Because G&A and property management mostly consist of compensation costs for off-site and corporate personnel, these line items are subject to the same cost pressures that I just mentioned as negatively impacting our on-site payroll number. And then finally to our capital expenditure guidance, in 2018 we plan to spend approximately $210 million, which is about $2,900 per same store unit in capitalized expenditures, which is about 8.8% of same store revenue. And about one-third of this is for improvements that we believe are revenue enhancing. Included as revenue enhancing in the $210 million is our unit renovation program, where we expect to spend $60 million to renovate approximately 4,500 units at a cost of about 13,300 per unit and which we expect will produce returns in the low double-digits.  Also providing a return is our spend of approximately $15 million to $20 million, on sustainability related projects like energy conservation through lighting and water retrofits, that both provide the company a strong 20% return as well as further our commitment to sustainability in all that we do. We will also continue our elevated spending level on customer facing projects, like lobbies, gyms and other amenities, to keep our extremely well located product competitive with new assets being delivered in our markets. Over the last few years we've been spending between 7% and 8.5% of our same store revenue on capital expenditures. Even with the slightly elevated level of capital expenditures in 2018, the company should continue to rank as one of the very best in its peer group in terms of capital spending as a percentage of same store revenues. We still do expect that overtime, our capital expenditure spending will modestly decline as we complete some large ongoing projects and renovate a large proportion of our units and as competitive pressures abate. I will now turn the call back over David Neithercut. David Neithercut : Thank you, Mark. I want to spend just a moment addressing the transaction Mark in development activity. So across our markets there continues to be a very strong demand for multifamily assets regularly demonstrated by deal prints supporting all time high valuations despite slowing revenue growth and rising interest rates. The sentiment across the space is that many investments remained under allocated to multifamily real estate and that a lot of capital is looking to be put to work in our space. In fact the annual NMHC meeting in Orlando several weeks ago attracted 6,000 registrants and by some estimates there were more than 8,000 attendees in total. Further evidence of the stability multifamily asset valuations can be found in our own disposition activity. In 2017, we sold five assets for $355 million and the prices realized were 102% of our internal valuations at the time and 105% of our 26 valuations of these same assets. Now as recently as October last year, we thought we might get closer to our original guidance of $500 million of dispositions in 2017, but had more than $100 million of closings move into January of this year. And these assets will trade at 105% of our most recent valuation expectations. Now with highly competitive demand for multifamily assets throughout 2017, we closed on no new acquisitions in the fourth quarter. And we closed on $468 million for the full year at a weighted average cap rate of 4.8%. Consistent with last year, we begin 2018 with an expectation for transaction activity of $500 million of acquisitions funded with $500 million of proceeds from dispositions. And like a year ago, we will only conduct this activity if it can be accomplished with the limited initial dilution and result in higher long-term total returns. Now turning to development, it is becoming more and more difficult as land prices remain strong and the growth in construction costs continues to outpace rent growth significantly reducing development yields in all markets. Nevertheless development capital appears to still be available and around of abundant supply for the right sponsors with the right deals. For the rest of them it appears that putting together a capital stack is becoming harder and harder. Our construction financing does remain available, but at lower advance rates and wider spreads, while requiring more capital support. To us, this all adds up to fewer starts and hence fewer deliveries in the very near future. Now development remains a core competency at Equity Residential and we have development expertise in each of our markets that continue to underwrite new development opportunities for consideration. But the fact of the matter is that we have not acquired a land parcel for development since 2015 when we assembled the site for 238 units in downtown San Francisco. Since then we've seen construction cost continue to escalate and revenue growth slow, resulting in development yield have forced us to the sidelines in taking down new land parcels. In the meantime, we've continue to work diligently to create value in our existing land inventory. During the year we completed $584 million of development projects at a weighted average yield of 6%, which represents a 175 to 200 basis points premium to cap rates in today's marketplace. In 2017, we also started two development projects totaling $114 million where we are targeting 5% to 5.5% returns on cost, representing 75 to 150 basis points cap rate premiums. Now at the present time, we have four development sites remaining in inventory, representing about $1 billion of total development cost and we currently expect to start the largest of these sometime this summer, because after nearly 10 years of extraordinarily hard work the team has all the necessary approvals to soon begin construction of a new tower on the site of our 50 year old parking garage located directly across the street from Boston's north station and the TD Boston Garden.  At 44 Floors this 469 unit property will be Boston's tallest apartment tower, the fantastic views and located in exciting and growing Boston neighborhood. As I said, we expect to begin demolition of a garage sometime this summer and deliver the tower in late 2021 at a cost of $410 million, our current underwriting point to a stabilized yield in the low sixes. Now before we open the call to questions I want to quickly comment on the change in the company\u2019s dividend policy that we announce last night. Coming out of the great recession with uncertain cash flow and an elevated level of development opportunities we adopted a conservative and totally transparent dividend policy pegged off of the midpoint of our initial annualized normalized FFO guidance. With our development spend reduced significantly we\u2019ll have a meaningful increase in uncommitted cash flow going forward and believe that increasing the distribution to our shareholders under this new policy is a very good use of cash at this time. So with all that said, operator we\u2019ll be happy now to open the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Nick Yulico with UBS. Nick Yulico : Thanks. David I just want to go back to the comments you had in the press release where you talked about the outlook in your coastal markets with high homeownership will soon improve significantly as new supply reduces. And I'm just looking to hear your view as to when you think this might happen if you\u2019re seeing any light at the end of the tunnel on supply in the second half of this year or is it more of a 2019 impact? David Neithercut : Well we really look at 2019 deliveries Nick as the beginning of the reduction. In 2018 we\u2019ll still have 2017 deliveries that are spillover into this year and I will say in 2019 we will still have 2018 deliveries spillover. But the number of deliveries that we count as competitive to our assets we see diminishing considerably in some markets less so in others, but we do see kind of light at the end of the tunnel with elevated level of new supply beginning in 2019. I'm not suggesting this going to zero, but clearly while we look at what we think will be and should be continued very strong demand we do see the supply we do see in 2019 and we believe that by that time we\u2019ll begin to see pricing power kind of return to the landlords. Nick Yulico : That\u2019s helpful. And then on New York City in the past you\u2019ve talked about Long Island City Brooklyn is having the bulk of the supply delivering this year it feels like you\u2019re now saying that that competitive impact could be a little bit worse or at least your guidance is factoring some of that in. So perhaps you can just tell us more about how you thought about Long Island City Brooklyn pricing of the competitive new supply impacting your portfolio in terms of your guidance for New York this year? Thanks. David Santee : This is David. At this point we have a lot of anecdotal stories, we have some examples of residents that move out of our communities in Brooklyn not to Long Island City, but after several months choose to move back. But as I said, I think, the long-term outcome of 6,200 units coming online is very hard to quantify. So we prepared for it last year certainly the number of units that are going to be delivered this year especially in the first half of the year are very, very elevated and we planned accordingly. And we hope the discipline stays in the market and owners remain picking to their guidance on profit. David Neithercut : I guess I\u2019d add to that Nick that these developers that are delivering this product have not seen a lot of rent growth from their regional performance and for them to meet their expectation, meet their investments expectation, meet their refinancing expectations, they\u2019re going to be forced to toe the line on pricing. Now that doesn\u2019t mean that some of them will get aggressive and we may not -- we won\u2019t feel that, but I think that unlike what we experienced in San Francisco in 2016 there\u2019s not a lot of cushion for the pricing expectations of these few folks that are delivering these product in Long Island City and that maybe very well why we saw discipline throughout the market in 2017. Nick Yulico : And just to follow-up -- that\u2019s helpful. So it sounds like you sacked in a fair amount of conservatism in New York relative to how this pricing impact could play out. David Neithercut : Well I guess we\u2019re as conservative going into this year as we were last year and obviously we outperformed our expectations, not we\u2019re saying the fact that New York was the worst performing market, so this performance was all relative. We still expect New York to be our worst-performing market, but if pricing discipline holds throughout the marketplace maybe for the reasons that we have noted maybe New York could do better. But I will tell you, if there is a crack in the dike than we could have an outcome on the downside. Nick Yulico : Thank you, David. David Neithercut : You are very welcome, Nick. Operator : And we'll go next to Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Juan Sanabria : Hi, thanks for the time. Just following up on Nick\u2019s question on New York, just hoping to better understand the same store revenue build where you guys are building in maybe potentially more concessions that you didn't necessarily see in 2017. If I didn't miss here, I thought you said, your expectation is for new leases down 3.7%, but you had a 50 basis point increase in 2017. So I was hoping you could just kind of walk us through that a little bit just to understand the assumptions on why you're starting out more conservative as you ended up in New York for 2017? David Santee : Well, I think it's more driven by what potentially could happen in the summer months, a lot of these deliveries will come online, starting at the end of Q1 into Q2 that's when a lot of your lease expirations occur. The other thing is that, New York has the lowest turnover of any market. So consequently renew increases have a bigger impact and have more staying power in New York. So when a new lease turns over the drop and the difference between the current rent and the new lease rent is much greater. So you\u2019ll just have more roll down in the rent rolled so to speak than we saw last year. And then we forecasted, we are prepared with the concessions we think are necessary should the market see pricing contagion with regard to concessions. Juan Sanabria : And so I just wanted to follow-up on that 2019 supply comment. Any sense portfolio wide at this point what the expected decline in units across your competitive set would be looking at 2018 deliveries versus your initial expectations for 2019 at this point? David Santee : I guess I would say 2019 numbers are definitely more bias towards the estimate than fact. But today, based on our boots on the ground and data that we reconcile through Axiometrics, we\u2019re showing almost a 30% decline in new deliveries in 2019 versus 2018. David Neithercut : Now that being said, there are some markets that might be consistent deliveries 2019 over 2018 and -- but more significant drop in other markets. But as David said it\u2019s difficult to make a real call on 2019 in markets in which unlike New York where it doesn\u2019t you can take less than 24 so months to deliver product. Certainly New York, we have an expectation of a material decrease and I think we probably be pretty close for most anything to be delivered in 2019 it's got to be underway in some fashion today. And our guys are covering all this stuff very closely for us. Juan Sanabria : Thank you very much. David Neithercut : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Rich Hightower : Hey, good morning guys. David Neithercut : Good morning, Rich. Rich Hightower : So a couple questions here. So I want to follow-up on some of the market commentary and thanks for all the color during the prepared comments, it was very helpful. But just to stress test the guidance a little bit and you spent a lot of time talking about New York, but maybe some of the other markets just you know what generally would have to happen for you to hit the bottom end of the range versus the high end of the range? I mean, how do to you guys probability wait the different outcomes. And then maybe further on those supply comment, I think we know with certainty that every time we look at these numbers at the beginning of the year the actual deliveries end up in some cases meaningfully less at the end of the year. And I'm wondering if you\u2019ve baked in that same sort of assessment to the way you've envision these markets to playing out in 2018. David Neithercut : Well I'll let David answer the first part of your question. I'll answer the second. So if there is any meaningful change at the end of the year it\u2019s just because that product got pushed into the next year. And as I think we've talked about at one of our last calls. A lot of the data you look at is based upon when properties receive their final CO, and that doesn't necessarily mean that the opening of the door and their first availability for actually occupancy were pushed back any. And we do track that very, very closely and we track not completions as defined by final CFOs, but when in each quarter or each month properties will actually be open for business and able to begin to compete with us actually thinking that occurs 60 or 90 days actually beforehand. So we've got our hand on the pulse of that competitive product. But as it relates to what kind of has to happen for us to be at the low end, I'll let David address it. David Santee : Well, to be at the low end, we'd have to pretty much miss in every market. But I mean as you referenced, we do pressure test, I mean, the art of forecasting in a market is really the gut feel, which way the winds are blowing and that's why we kind a check mark San Francisco, I mean, we feel very good about San Francisco, the headlines are positive. We've had a strong start to the year probably our best last in the last three or four years. So we feel that we consider all of the variables that San Francisco has very positive momentum. Relative to our forecast on Southern California, based upon where our properties are located, the general direction of the economy, we feel that it would be more difficult to outperform, but on the other hand lower risk to underperform. Washington DC for the last three or four years it's been pretty much flat revenue growth. And there is uncertainty with the federal government and what the new budgets will look like that could pressure jobs. I mean, I think a quarter above jobs in DC are directly related to the federal government. So we see -- when we look at DC we see that risk we see continued elevated supply.  And when you look at even the suburbs in DC is stretching far out the rest and what have you those markets are not generating revenue growth as well. So DC would probably be more at risk to the downside. And then New York it just comes down to concessions. I mean, we feel very good about rates will do, what have you the number one variable with New York City is. As pricing remained disciplined and can we manage through these elevated supplies without new deliveries or lease up increasing concessions to a point where it creates contagion across the market. Rich Hightower : That's helpful. Can you guys specify where you are in terms of an overall earn in so far for 2018? David Santee : You mean embedded growth? Rich Hightower : I'm sorry say that again? David Santee : You're asking about sort of what we thought our embedded growth was beginning the New Year? Rich Hightower : Yes, that's exactly right. David Santee : So for the portfolio it's 70 basis points. Rich Hightower : Okay. David Neithercut : Just might describe what that means, David. David Santee : Yes, so what we do is really just take the value of the rent roll for the portfolio on 12/31 for the month, annualized that and divide it by full year 2017 that rent roll value. And that generates 70 basis points. So on the assumption that all other income components stay equal you would generate 70 basis points of revenue growth. David Neithercut : Thank you. Do you have another question? Rich Hightower : Yes, I do one separate question on the dividend. So after the prepared comments, just maybe give us a little more color to the decision there, how increasing the dividend and maybe making the policy a little more flexible compared to other avenues to return shareholder capital including share repurchases? And then Mark, I want to fold you into this as well, can you remind us where EQR is in terms of run rate, free cash flow versus the taxable income, dividend requirement and some of those other elements as we think about the calculation. So it's a bit of\u2026 David Neithercut : So maybe I think -- yes, that will be best maybe for Mark answer that question with the statistics and then I'll talk -- and I'll share with you how the Board thought about those as it change this policy. Mark Parrell : So let's start with just free cash flow then talk tax and then David will interject the policy overlay. So the number to probably start with for 2017 is something around -- or 2018 pardon me is something around $270 million of cash flow after the dividend assuming the run rate dividend but we hadn\u2019t increased it. We have some additional CapEx and that we disclosed in the release. So that uses up $10 million call it. The incremental dividend is another $25 million use. So now you are down of about $235 million, then you have development spending of $100 million to $150 million, it's closer to the high-end of that range because of the addition of the Boston Garden garage that David Neithercut describe in his remarks, which leaves you $80 million to $100 million of excess cash flow that now in our model effectively reduces debt. So if you look, you'll see that we're paying down $1.2 billion in debt this year, but we're only issuing $900 million to $1 billion. So that difference is partly a draw on the line of credit, but it's also partly the application of this excess cash, at least in our model and guidance to repaying debt. In terms of taxable income, we've got plenty of room. We distribute already significantly more than were required few under the re-tax rule. So every year just to give you an approximation we can sell about $400 million of assets and retain the cash without affecting our dividend policy, meaning without forcing the dividend higher. With that I'll turn it over to, David. David Neithercut : Yes, so with all in mind, I think, we have had conversations on these calls for at least the last year and certainly conversations with our Board for the same time period. Giving everyone the heads up that as our development starts were rolling down that as we were looking forward beginning sort of 2018, that we were looking at elevated levels of sort of uncommitted cash and discussing sharing with you all and sharing with our Board what are range of opportunities where with respect to that cash and one of those always was an increased distribution or annual dividend to our shareholders, which is resulted in this new policy. We also did share with the Board that in doing so, that didn't preclude us from doing anything else with excess cash that by doing this that did not preclude us from buying stock back, did not preclude us from starting some additional development transactions like the deal in Boston that we've talked about or buying other deals or taking down new land. So this is just one way one that we\u2019re using this excess and we still have excess capacity to explore any other options and we think it's in our best interest to do so. Rich Hightower : Okay. Thank you for those comments. David Neithercut : You bet Rich, thank you. Operator : We'll take the next question from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Richard Hill : Hey guys, good morning. So I think there has been a few questions about this and just want to get a little bit of a better sense of cadence as you think about same store revenue growth between 1H and 2H. And it seems to me and I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth there seems to me maybe still some bumpy roads in the first half with improvement in the second half as we start to get pass this supply. Is that fair and could you give us any more color about that? Mark Parrell : It's Mark, and I'm going to start and I think David Santee may end up contributing as well on some of the details. But that isn't quite right, sort of as we sit here in January, David talked about the embedded growth. We feel pretty comfortable with our level of first quarter growth and we came into 2018 with pretty good momentum. In 2017 and then this relatively good embedded growth that David Santee just mentioned. In light of some of the upcoming supply headwinds and sort of increased move-in and move-out activity that you always see from us in the second and third quarter. We believe that sort of a step down in our numbers for the reminder of the year is prudent and is what is implied in our guidance. So if you look at the way our quarter-over-quarter revenue numbers moved in 2017, there is likely to be a great deal of parallelism in how those numbers move in 2018. Now if we are able to hold occupancy and increase rate as the year progresses, or we utilized fewer concessions we may very well end up with the upper half of our revenue range. But at this early point of the year our guidance kind of is our reasonable best view of what can be achieved in the year. Richard Hill : Got it. And so that was sort of my follow up question I think there was a question about what would be the low end of the guidance range, but the top end of the guidance range might -- I think there\u2019s an expectation that pushing supply out in 2017 help you achieve the upfront of that range. This year it\u2019s going to be really driven by you achieving the top end of the occupancy range where supply is coming for the most part. Is that fair or how should we be thinking about it? David Neithercut : Well, I mean, the stuff doesn\u2019t turn on and turn off, this is a -- supply is out there we\u2019re still dealing with supply delivered last year and there\u2019s sufficient supply now that is we\u2019re dealing with it and it doesn\u2019t -- there\u2019s not a first half and a second half. I mean, we do track when these things open every quarter, but the fact, the belief out there that somehow our performance this year was a result of new supply sort of being pushed back is just not correct.  It\u2019s just that the markets performed better than we thought, the teams did a great job and it\u2019s not because for some reason there was not as much new supply as we might have thought at the new year. There\u2019s sufficient new supply in the marketplace that we\u2019re dealing with that whatever got pushed back. And again I note that pushing back is the pushing back of the completion not necessarily the pushing back of the delivery of new product that\u2019s competing with us. Richard Hill : Got it, that\u2019s really helpful. I\u2019ll follow-up offline with any additional questions, thanks guys. David Neithercut : Thank you, Rich. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Dennis McGill, Gilman Associates. Dennis McGill : Hi, thank you guys. Actually just clarifying that last statement David, so when we think about the comment earlier about 2018 supply being pretty similar to 2017, I think at this time last year you would have had more of an optimistic view that 2017 would have been the peak. So as you weigh what\u2019s different today versus a year ago as it relates to 2018. How much of the higher level of competition in 2018 is a reflection of 2017 stuff being delayed versus more being in the pipeline than was visible at this time last year? David Neithercut : Yes, again it\u2019s forward not the latter I mean it\u2019s just and again I want to just emphasize this notion of delay. When properties are completed which is how everybody track this all the third party densities track this it\u2019s by completion, which is when they get their final CFO that does not mean that they were delayed in opening their own doors. We had a couple of properties ourselves, and one in San Francisco last year and one in Seattle last year, that was delayed or the completion pushed back but the opening of the door, the day on which these properties became available for rent was not delayed it was simply the completion that was pushed back for various reasons. And one of them we didn\u2019t get some street gate work done because of some issues with the city, but the property opened its doors it was available for lease right on time. So I want to just get away from the people thinking about the stuff was delayed, which means it wasn\u2019t competitive in 2017 it was competitive even though it was pushed back. As we add up the completions of 2017 plus the completions of 2018 the total there really has been no change in our review and the way that we look at competitive product. Dennis McGill : Okay. And then similarly as you talked about the very preliminary look into 2019 and the step down is that from the competitive side or from the actual completion side? David Neithercut : The stats we would give you would be on the completion side. We do give you data that may not be the same footprint as the third party services, but it is defined the same way as the third party services. Dennis McGill : Okay, perfect. David Neithercut : Okay, because we don\u2019t look at say New York Metropolitan area we look -- we draw a different boundary and consider that product that we believe would be impactful to our market. But we do track completions in the manner in which I described you as completed in final CFO which is consistent with the third party service providers. Dennis McGill : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then second question just as it relates to the fourth quarter sorry if I missed this, but do you have the renewal and new lease numbers for the fourth quarter and then maybe any color you can provide on thus far as well? David Santee : Sure, renewals for Q4 were 4.6% and then lease over lease was minus 4.2%. David Neithercut : Now as David has mentioned several times on these calls those new lease rates reductions always are sort of wider than on average, because you're often re-leasing units in the down of the winter versus the up in the summer. And so when people for whatever reason have to come in and term their lease, they leased it at the peak of the season where we got the highest pricing they\u2019re giving it back to us in the lowest time of the season. So it's not uncommon for that delta to be the widest when it\u2019s happening in the wintertime or in the fourth or first quarters and it also does not account for any prepayment penalty or cancellation fees that we might have received. David Santee : And then let me give you January and February renewal numbers. January, closed out at 4.6% on renewals, February thus far which is early and we would expect this number to jump up again another 20 basis points is 4.4%. Dennis McGill : And the new lease on January? David Santee : We don't track the new lease numbers on a month-by-month basis. Dennis McGill : Alright, thanks guys. Good luck. David Neithercut : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Conor Wagner with Green Street Advisors. Conor Wagner : Good morning, David Neithercut : Good morning, Conor. Conor Wagner : David Santee on the Bay area, could you break out your expectations by the three submarkets there, San Francisco, San Jose and open East Bay. David Santee : Well, let me say this most of our portfolio is in the Peninsula and South Bay, we have a few assets in the East Bay Berkeley that should do better this year. So really all I mean most of our assets in downtown San Francisco are still new store. So when you think about same store, it\u2019s really the Peninsula South Bay, which we feel should do very well as I stated in my comments. So the driver of the full market would be greatly influenced by Peninsula and South Bay. Conor Wagner : And then within your Bay area forecast, what are you thinking about the impact of H1B and do you have any sense for how many of your residents are H1B holders? David Santee : We measured that before, I mean, we really haven't seen any material impact from that, I mean, lot of the H1Bs were kind of the $60,000, $70,000 a year jobs, I think the -- we employees -- employers typically get sole security numbers and what have for the employees after they move in. So our proxy is really to kind of measure the number of residents that don't have a sole security number. And that numbers been consistent, but we really haven't seen any negative fallout from all the H1B headlines. Conor Wagner : And you are not forecast anything really to change on that this year? David Santee : No, I mean, the only thing that\u2019s changed really last year was this express approval process, I don't -- I think the actual number of visas really remained unchanged in the big scheme of things. So it's really more about I think they kind of all get approved in like the end of Q3 versus companies paying up $1,500 to $1,000 for this express approval, which I believe that was what was eliminated, the express approval. Conor Wagner : Thank you. And then David Nethercutt you mentioned on development 5% to 5.5% return on cost and the spread that is their cap rates and the bid that you received on your dispositions with your stock trading at an above 5% implied cap rate. How attractive is even a small share buyback given you Mark Parrell that you have $400 million in annual capacity to do that? David Neithercut : Not sure, we attract it at all at these levels and as you know by your own math, that you have shared with us that the after taxable gains and being balance sheet neutral there's just not a lot of capital left after dispositions to make a meaningful impact. And the impact that it has just generally on the enterprise going forward, we don\u2019t think it makes sense at these levels. That being said, we have bought stock back in the past and we won't hesitate to do so in the future.  But levels at which we've traded off of that AZ today and this is about the level that we experienced six or so months ago. The management team here saying the Board just don't believe that the discount is enough to have it make sense particularly given the taxable gains that's embedded in the assets that we own today. Conor Wagner : And so use of the free cash flow even like $100 million buyback doesn't look attractive to you? David Neithercut : I think that that's an option with free cash flow. I guess, I was responding more to the notion of selling assets to buy stock back. There is not a lot of capacity there. But from the free cash flow perspective that is certainly a perspective use of that capital. Conor Wagner : And how perspective? David Neithercut : Well, I mean, it's just an option on the table. I mean, we'll act and we\u2019ll let you know when we act, and don\u2019t let you know ahead of time. Conor Wagner : Thank you. David Neithercut : That's certainly an option that we have with that capital. But we've said for the last year it remains an option. And as I noted in a response to one of the earlier questions nothing that we've done with respect to the increased demand nor the commencement of this deal in Boston has precluded us from having ample cash capacity to do anything else. Conor Wagner : Thank you. David Neithercut : You bet. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Michael Bilerman with Citi. Michael Bilerman : Hey, it's Michael Bilerman here, with Nick. I'm curious David how you feel about sort of the overall private equity and just other money looking at multifamily in a large scale transaction. To-date a lot of that capital has gone to higher cap rate product, value add, secondary markets or southern assets, the assets. And pretty much everyone has been playing in that and may have been able to get the leverage and get pretty attractive ROE. If you think about the deal you did with Starwood in that sale do you think there is capital for a larger scale core type transaction of the product that you own today? David Neithercut : That's hard to say, Michael. And I guess, I\u2019d first add that if notice the Starwood transaction I'm not sure anyone who still exists today has done more in that space than we have with the sale we did to Starwood. Anyone who might have done more doesn't exist as they've gone public to private. But we\u2019re a big company and it's hard to say just because Brookfield might think they can do some of the GGP doesn't mean that same level of capital is available to do large transactions. So, I guess, I believe that to you and other sort of pundits to suggest, it's tough for me to say. Michael Bilerman : I'm just wondering whether you see that now core building up in more assets in the markets that you have whether there is appetite that you're seeing from capital sources to buy that product, because most of the capital has been targeted towards higher yielding product. As this didn't know whether there\u2026 David Neithercut : I think most of maybe the big capital investments have been, but there has been plenty of one-off capital acquisitions of what we\u2019d considered to be core product. I mean, there are prints every day of core products that might not be billion, multibillion dollar transactions of core products. But we think that there is a lot of demand for at least one-off core product that continues to print on a regular basis showing very strong values in cap rates and freeze and certainly low 4s across our portfolio. Now whether or not that's available in scale which is your question, I just -- I can't comment, I just don't know. Michael Bilerman : And your Chairman has been pretty vocal about as you on equity markets and also selling a lot in certainly he's doing that through on a real estate basis through ETC liquidating a lot of those assets. How does his views sort of translate into your strategy from an asset recycling perspective and narrowing this above average discount to your peers as well as above average discount just to pure NAV? David Neithercut : Well, I guess if my math is correct, we've sold more in the last couple of years than ETC has not as a percentage of the company obviously. But I think the $6 billion sale we've done in 2016 is more than ETC and probably worth more than EQC\u2019s total valuation. So it may not represent as larger share in the company, but we\u2019ve been as active as anyone. Michael Bilerman : I'm not insinuating that you haven\u2019t done a lot of things I'm saying that\u2026 David Neithercut : No, I appreciate that I'm not suggesting you insinuate that, but I just think it\u2019s important to communicate to everybody else on the call to just kind of put some of these things in perspective. And so I think Sam obviously he had his view, much of his view of what you hear and talk about on Quark [ph] Box or Bloomberg or whatever is a general view. He has more of his network away from real estate than he does in real estate. I mean, it\u2019s just more of a sort of general view and obviously I have conversation with him more specifically with respect to Equity Residential.  And I can tell you that Sam is not concerned at all about discount to NAV, his suggestion to us after having done the dispositions we did a couple of years ago and his understanding about the arithmetic relative to buying stock back at the current discount, which we believe was insufficient Sam says go run your business, he plans something around for a long time and encourages us to kind of run our business without regard to where the stock price is. That being said, if the discount widens we\u2019ll begin to maybe perhaps need to have a different conversation, but right now it\u2019s go run your business. Michael Bilerman : Just last question in terms of capital you talked a little bit about the equity side and how it\u2019s unsure whether there\u2019s large pockets of software [ph] and or a private equity that would be willing to take down large scale portfolios versus single assets I'm curious what your views on the lending market and Fannie & Freddie certainly bumping up over 50% of the multifamily lending market last year. And whether you think this appetite and what you\u2019re seeing sort of on the mortgage side to fund core type deals? Mark Parrell : Hey, Michael, it's Mark. Fannie & Freddie as you said has just been extremely active, we anticipate them being extremely active in 2018. They have a slight preference probably and their pricing reflects it for certain types of affordable product, but they are certainly a very significant lender on our kind of product as well. And I think are able to do things in size. I would caution however that their ability just really for political reasons to do very large loans on very visible transactions is something I can\u2019t -- I've not discussed and I can\u2019t underwrite or explain. I mean, their ability to just finance our product in the ordinary course I think is unfettered, we have very little secured debt now especially by the end of this year. So we\u2019ve got plenty of room with them and I think others do to. But to do very, very large loans that I think you\u2019re talking about is both in underwriting decision and in their case due to conservative a political decision and that I can\u2019t give you any opinion. David Neithercut : Well, that\u2019s true, but we\u2019ll just sort of add there has not been a transaction in the multi-space of public to private that was not significantly financed by those agencies. Now again to your point Michael that was smaller sizes, but they played a very significant role in -- I think in every public to private event that we\u2019ve seen in our space. Now again there\u2019s political issues that doesn\u2019t mean it will continue, but they have played that role. Michael Bilerman : Alright, thanks for your time, guys. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Rob Stevenson with Janney. Robert Chapman Stevenson : Good morning or afternoon guys. Just a couple of questions left, in terms of the $0.04 negative impact in the first quarter on a sequential basis from same store, can you talk about whether or not that\u2019s more revenue or expense driven and what markets are predominantly driving that as well? Mark Parrell : Hey, it's Mark. It\u2019s really about some real estate tax refunds that we got that I sort of alluded to in my remarks in the fourth quarter. So that just meant that the usual decline we have between the first quarter and the fourth was $0.02 larger throughout really was just those couple of large refunds running through this system in Q4, increasing FFO in that quarter and just making it look like that difference was larger instead of sort of that being spread out probably in 2018 and just kind of move forward a bit. Robert Chapman Stevenson : Okay. And then Mark can you help me understand what the next couple of years on New York tax abatement stuff looks like, I mean, you guys have a lot of assets in the city. I mean, is it just a constant role of those programs down to over the next couple of years or does the peg [ph] go through the pipe on at some point in time and you get back to a more -- you can just sort of normalized the tax abatement stuff in your same store expenses and your same store property taxes? Mark Parrell : I think, it's probably fair to assume there is 150 basis points to 200 basis points for the medium term of growth in our number due to New York 421-a burn off, there isn\u2019t a particular year Rob that\u2019s at all ends in the next year and it's all done, it does go on for some number of years. But I just want to add a remark, it sort of like prepaying a loan, every year you get closer to the end of the loan maturity, the prepayment penalty goes down. Every year we get closer to the end of the 421-a period, the cap rate on these assets decline. So NAV is being created because they trade as these assets get stabilized at a lower cap rate, but in the mean time you do feel it through the P&L in property tax expense. Robert Chapman Stevenson : All right. And then last one for me, any update on relationship with Airbnb and how that's progressing relative to expectations? David Santee : Sure, this is David Santee. We completed the rollout of additional pilots on the 18 properties in Q4 -- I'm sorry 14 building in Q4. And there is not a lot of activity in Q4 as a lot -- most of these buildings that we put on this portfolio were more corporate housing company type properties that typically will Airbnb some vacancies and that's why we selected the specific group of buildings. So it's more about just getting visibility into what these companies are doing and I don't think there has been any surprises, but it's doing exactly what we thought it would do, which is give us transparency into the entire process. Robert Chapman Stevenson : Okay, guys. Thank you, appreciate it. David Neithercut : You bet, Rob. Operator : We'll go next to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Thank you. David four of your six core markets are finalized for the Amazon HQ2. I was wondering if what your thoughts were on which market if we announce the winner would be the best for your company. David Neithercut : Would be the best for the company, that market in which we\u2019ve got the highest allocation of capital deploy. I think everybody is having a great deal of fun trying to figure this out. We think the DC market identify three sort of submarkets within DC. We think that there is a possibility there that would certainly be good for that marketplace. It\u2019d be good for any market, but certainly would be most beneficial in those markets in which we have most NOI coming up. John Kim : Okay. And then the second question is on your same store rental rate declined a little bit of quarter to $2,720, I was wondering if in your 2018 guidance if that contemplates an increase in rates? Mark Parrell : So for full year when you look at 25, when you smooth out the leases on renewals and new lease expectations, it doesn't show much growth. John Kim : The $2,720 is the GAAP number so that\u2019s effective rental rate? David Neithercut : That's a number from the press release. Mark Parrell : I'm sorry you are on $2,720 for the fourth quarter? John Kim : Yes, sorry this is page 11, of your supplemental. Mark Parrell : Yes, I mean it customarily goes down and it's not stunning thing for it to decline in the fourth quarter, a little bit, I mean, it's not as transaction intensely a quarter. David has given some of the parameters about renewals in new lease rates in the rest and I think that what you are going to see in new lease rates there and average run rate is it will go up but only very modestly. David Neithercut : Yes, we talked a little bit about how -- previously about how lease over lease rent that delta is the widest during this time of year when we're often re-leasing units that had been leased previously during the best time of the year meaning the summer. Due to lease cancelations or for whatever reasons and these numbers out again as I noted don\u2019t include a breakage cost that we receive from the person walking out. So it\u2019s the delta while yes lease to lease but that\u2019s not the full economic impact to the company, because of the lease breakage cost that we recover. Mark Parrell : And just to add, I mean, it went down in 2016, I mean, this is not like I said an uncommon thing to have happened. So I wouldn\u2019t take it as a read through against anything that this year in 2018 is particularly ominous. It\u2019s just sort of the way the fourth quarter and compared to the third sequentially often play out. John Kim : Okay, thanks for the color. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to John Guinee with Stifel. John Guinee : John Guinee here, thank you. Let me just focus on two things, first, operating expenses, you mentioned real estate taxes 4% to 5% to 6%, utilities 3% to 4% personnel 5% and we fully expect personnel to continue to go up at least 5% annually they do a great job deserve it. Do you think we should be thinking that real estate taxes and utilities are all going to go up at these sort of levels for the next three to five years or was this a one-time aberration? Mark Parrell : Thanks for that question John, its Mark, and I think David Santee also contribute to this answer. But on payroll just to give you a little background certainly a lot of that is the very deserving pay raises to our on-site personnel, but a portion of these estimates we've given you reflect our estimates and it's very difficult to estimate this changes in our medical insurance reserves like most employers healthcare costs are very significant to us, and we\u2019re effectively self-insured. So large claims which are your lumpy can really move our numbers. We made an estimate of that in there and we had a good experience towards the end of 2017 and you saw our payroll number decline and depending on that that could move that number a lot. So I don't feel that 5% is actually a terrific run rate going forward, I think it\u2019s probably good estimate for this year, because of impart these medical costs as well as the pay increases. On utilities, I think, our estimate of 3 to 4% we hope to be near the lower end to that range but it\u2019s more based on just having terrific result over the past three years, where we were negative in two years and up 2% and seeing some increases in trash in Los Angeles and a few small things, David Santee and his team do a lot of repurchases and hedging of utility costs that\u2019s been very effective. So I don\u2019t think you should think of utilities as a run rate 3% to 4% necessarily, it could be lower. And finally on real estate taxes, the big two things that we were trying to handicap this year because the 421-a stuff is understood is in New Jersey there is submarkets that we\u2019re in that are having their first reassessment in a generation. It\u2019s very hard for us to guess how that will turn out, we may have been too cautious in which case our number is too high or we made out of it.  We also have to take some guess as to how many of our appeals are successful, we are good at that, we pay a lot of attention, we have had some success of late, we hope for more. Depending how that goes you could see that number decline as well from the range I gave you in the script. So a little bit of color for you, but for your run rate I'm not sure 5% is the right number for payroll, that's probably the one comment I\u2019d give you. John Guinee : Okay. We hope no one is listening from the properties for that one. Okay then the second question, merchant builders as you know are about 95%, 98% of all development starts the re-crowd is relatively insignificant and they've been -- they used to underwriter to 100 and 150 basis points spread and they were getting 200 basis point spread and creating a lot of value. Do you see any signs that the merchant builders are closing up shop, laying off people or do you see any signs that equity investors are just shutting down their interest in multifamily? Or do you expect maybe these spreads just to come down and the merchant builders maybe building to a 50 to 100 basis points spreads instead of 100 plus. Mark Parrell : Well I guess I'd say perhaps all of the above. There certainly we believe equity capital that is now sitting on the sidelines because of the sort of shrinking yields. And we do believe that there are some lesser well-capitalized merchant builders that might not -- might have to be forced to the sidelines. At the same time they were certainly well-capitalized, experienced their folks that continue to have access to capital and they may not be building at lesser yields, they just maybe building different product in different locations or different submarkets or further away from their urban core. So I think it\u2019s a little bit of everything. John Guinee : Great, thank you. Mark Parrell : You\u2019re very welcome. Operator : We'll go next to Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning out there. I'll try to be quite quick by two questions. First, David, assuming that Amazon doesn't take the DC area for HQ2, you guys have almost 20% of NOI there and yet you have that market just continues to produce a huge amount of supply every year. And the job outlook that you provided based on the government hiring doesn't sound so great. So if Amazon doesn\u2019t take there, would you guys consider pairing some of your exposure in that market? David Neithercut : Well, sure. I mean we'll consider pairing in every market Alex. What you say is true, we've got a big exposure in DC, that market is really underperformed and we believe will continue to underperform given what we see hiring in the government as well as our outlook for new supply. And those are one of those markets that we think will not see a reduction in new supply come by 2019. So it's certainly a market that we believe will continue to be under pressure. All that being said, there are trades being printed in that marketplace that continue to support valuation. So while the top lines and bottom lines might not be growing we've not seen any real diminution in certain valuations. And I guess I'll say also these tides turn we saw phenomenal results in DC coming out of the great recession. And my guess is DC has been over the long-term a fantastic apartment market we don't think it will be anything other than a fantastic apartment market, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have periods of time in which it doesn't do well. So we've got great assets in the district, and we think again as more and more demand for people wanting to live in the district or in the close in sort of walkable communities in which we\u2019ve got assets in Alexandria and Silver Springs and [indiscernible] et cetera. We think that market will do okay, but we do acknowledge that it's been underperformed at least in terms of revenue growth for the next several years. David Santee : And we did just to remind you Alex, we did sell a fair amount of DC as part of the Starwood transaction and where assets packaged up some of the further out suburban stuff. And we got rid as part of that deal as well. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, that's helpful. And then the second question for David Santee. You talked about the revenue trend expectations for the year. But as far as pricing power, do you foresee that you'll have your normal peak leasing season pricing power or is there a concern that just given how the markets are shaking out that you may not be able to fully push as much as you normally would like as you head into the peak later the spring? David Santee : Well I think the lease over lease numbers that I gave you on a market-by-market are indicative of the curve that we expect in each market. But nevertheless there will be a curve. And the shape of that curve is going to be a little bit different in each market. So yes, we expect peak pricing in the call it April through August periods. And to what levels those rise will determine the outcome of our full year revenue growth. David Neithercut : So if I may add on that, Alex for just a moment. Certainly pricing power is the issue that we have, but demand is not the issue. The occupancies remained very, very strong, so this was just not a function of attracting traffic, it's just how much pricing power we have and we're seeing less today obviously than we did in the five or six years immediately following the great recession. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you. David Neithercut : You're welcome. Operator : And we'll move next to Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Tayo Okusanya : Good afternoon everyone. Just two quick ones from me, the first one in the markets where you are seen increasing supply, could you talk a little bit about just how the local developers or the merchant builders are behaving in regards to lease up progress they get with pricing concessions and is there any concern even in first quarter that you guys may have to kind of compete at that level to get it rationale like they did a year ago? David Neithercut : Well, as we see the markets today, we believe that they have been very similarly to 2017 acting quite rationally. I think as David Santee said in his prepared remarks and in response to some previous questions Tayo. That could change particularly in New York, but we believe that developers are offering normal sort of levels build concession, they offer in order to stimulate lease up, but we\u2019ve not seeing anything that we would believe would be concern for us today, but we remain very cautious about New York and how that might change. But as I\u2019ve noted earlier the fact the rents haven\u2019t moved much since these deals started, we believe gives them very, very little cushion on the ultimate net effective lease rates they need to achieve to meet their expectations for their investors and to meet their expectations for their refinance amounts. Tayo Okusanya : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then my last question just to confirm in 2018 you do not forecast we\u2019ll have any developments starts in your guidance? David Santee : I did I noted that we expect this summer to begin the demolition of our property in Boston, and to begin that demolition of that old garage is going to be the start of that process it does not require a great deal of capital this year. But we will begin -- our expectation is we will begin construction on that project this year. Tayo Okusanya : This year. Okay great. Thank you. Operator : With no questions remaining, I\u2019d like to turn the call back to management for additional comments or closing remarks. David Neithercut : Great well we\u2019ve been added a while, I appreciate your patience and look forward to seeing everybody around the season. So thank you very much for your attention today. Operator : Thank you, sir. That does conclude our call for today. Thank you for participating you may disconnect at this time.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead, sir. Marty McKenna : Thank you, Angel. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's first quarter 2018 operating results. Our featured speakers today are David Neithercut, our President and CEO; David Santee, our Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Manelis, who will take from David on July 1 as COO. Mark Parrell, our Chief Financial Officer is here as well for the Q&A. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. And now I'll turn the call over to David Neithercut. David Neithercut : Thanks, Marty and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for today's conference call. Now as announced last night, the first quarter came in pretty much in line with our expectations. Thanks to occupancy levels are remained quite high, another quarter of very strong retention and having achieved very impressive renewal rates during the quarter, all of this, despite significant new supply across most of our markets. Now this performance, as a result of the relentless focus on our prospects, residents and properties by our property management and operational teams and everyone across our enterprise that supports those teams. Because notwithstanding, it was very deep and very resilient demand for apartment living in our urban and highly walkable suburban markets. We\u2019re facing peak new deliveries in many of our markets this year, which means it is a very competitive marketplace for new perspective residents and our existing residents have a lot of options from which to choose when they lease with us comes up for renewal. So I cannot emphasize enough of the benefits revised from the remarkable cost and service delivery each and every day by our dedicated teams across the country. Now as far as line, I can remember these efforts have been led in part by a Chief Operating Officer, David Santee, who has most of you know is stepping down as our COO on July 1 and he will retire from Equity at the end of the year. Since join the company 23 years ago, David has had a profound impact on all aspects of EQR and it is hard to imagine the company without him. But among a long list of David's accomplishments is a fact that Michael Manelis is ready to step in his role and move us forward without missing a beat. Now everyone will miss David, and I can tell you, it sure as hell won't be the same without him. But thanks to the work he has done in planning for this event. We will carry on, it only get better from here. So I'm happy now to turn the call over to David for what could be his final quarterly earnings call. The preparation for which I know will be one of the things he will miss most when he's going. David Santee : Okay. Thank you, David. Our reported Q1 results leave us very well positioned as we enter the early stages of our peak leasing season. With the elevated delivers across all of our markets, we are pleased with our quarter played out. Revenue growth of 2.2% was a result of achieving our goals for both rate growth and improved occupancy. Renewal rates achieved for the quarter were 4.6%, which is equal to or better than 2017 quarterly results. Our turnover increased 20 basis points year-over-year, Q1 of 2017 was one of our \u2013 one of the best in our history, creating a very tough. Most of our markets were almost flat or down with most of the increase turnover occurring in Seattle. Moved outs to via home continues to be a non-event declining to 11.2% of move out from the 12.5% in Q1 of 2017. A while we've had a good quarter on the books, we know that this leasing season will see more new deliveries in a years past. And like last year, we know that is critically important that every team member at every community knows our operating strategy and the role that they play in renewing and retain both residents and employees. Next week, I\u2019ll join our senior property management leaders to meet with every employee in every market. This is a matter of strategy, communicate our support and learn how we can continue to be faster and better in a very competitive environment. And before I pass it over to Michael for the market commentary, I'd like to take a minute to first thank all of you in the investment community, with your support and believe in Equity Residential more importantly me. It's been one hell of a ride. We all have our own expectations of ourselves in our careers and I feel lucky and bless to have been COO of the best public multi-family company in the world. And to all my friends and family at Equity Residential both past and present, I've always been humbled by your passion and commitment to our company and extremely grateful to the tremendous support that you have given me over the past 23 years. It's been passed at times, it's been furious at times, but it has always been fun. Now many of you on the phone have met Mike over the years. And he and I have spent the last 18 months planning for today. I know I speak for many when I say congratulations and tell you how excited and confident we are in you taking us forward. Michael? Michael Manelis : Thank you, David. So you have been an outstanding teacher for us and friend for the past 18 years. I'm very excited by the opportunity to be this great company\u2019s next Chief Operating Officer. And I truly appreciate all that you have done to prepare me for this floor. So now onto the market. So let's start with Boston. Boston\u2019s residential portfolio performed as expected with occupancy at 95.5% for the quarter and renewals at 4.5%. Our reported first quarter revenue modestly benefited from strong parking garage income. As we moved into March, demand in occupancy were improving in every submarket, this gave us the confidence to start pushing rate in advance of the peak leasing season. But with 61% of the new deliveries begin in the city of Boston and Cambridge where we have 72% of our NOI. We will be watching our occupancy closely. Fortunately, job growth remains strong and continues to support the absorption of new product being delivered. Boston, with its well educated workforce continues to attract large corporate expansion and relocation, especially into the Kendall Square and Seaport areas. Reebok recently stated that they already have 750 employees working at their new Seaport location and recent announcements for Max Mutual and Amazon will continue to strength. As of this morning, I could tell you, we are positioned exactly where we want to be in Boston. Our baselines are up 50 basis points year-over-year, compared to the same week last year. And our occupancy is 96.7%, which is up 40 basis points over the same period last year. Renewal performance remains strong with expected achieved increases for April at 4% and May at 4.2%. Onto New York which has been the focus of many conversations given the elevated supply in 2018. Overall pricing remains disciplined. Our operating metrics were slightly better than we expected with occupancy at 96.0%, renewals up 2.9% and our use of concessions being lower than we expected for the quarter. And a market with elevated supply, it should be no surprise that you read a lot of headlines about increased concession use. We remain focused on competitive net effect of pricing and the use of concessions with our stabilized asset is very targeted and primarily used as a marketing tool for a given unit type or even a specific unit. With yield management in place, the introduction of a concession is not always equate to an exactly reduction in net effective price. During the first quarter, 20% to 30% of our weekly applications received so form of concession. This is compared to a similar percent of application receiving concessions in Q1 of 2017. Today, our occupancy in New York is 96.7%, which is 60 basis points better than the same week last year. Base rents are flat. And for the past several weeks, we have issued concessions to less than 10% of our new application. Renewals remain strong with 2.5% expected for both April and May against quote that we\u2019re just a little bit over 5%. Bottom line is that we are well positioned, as we enter the peak leasing season, where the majority of our transactions will occur. New York employment is at an all time high and we continue to hear stories about companies revving up hiring an increase in compensation. We're going to continue to balance rate and occupancy in strategically utilized concessions only where needed. Our position today is better than what we anticipated when we gave guidance. But we are still early in the year and have two of the largest quarters of deliveries coming out. The results for the next 90 days will have a significant impact on a full year revenue performance and our local team is highly engaged and ready to perform in this peak leasing season. So moving to DC. The main headline for DC is absorption. And we're off to a promising start. DC\u2019s apartment market has absorbed more Class A units over the last 12 months than any time in its history. The positive economic conditions that helped maintain Class A absorption at a pace well above its historical average. However the elevated level of new supply continues to have a moderating effect and rent growth. Our first quarter revenue growth was consistent with our expectations, occupancy was 96.1%, which was 20 basis points higher in Q1 of 2017 and renewals were up 4.0%. Today our occupancy in DC is 96.4%, which is 70 basis points higher than the same week last year. Building up the occupancy in advance of the leasing season was absolutely part of our operating strategy and has allowed us to maintain growth for our ninth consecutive week in a row. Today our base lines are 80 basis points higher than they were the same week last year, we achieved \u2013 we expect to achieve a 4.1% increase on renewals in April and are trending to a 4.0% increase in May. Again this is a market where we are well positioned, but we are still early in the leasing season and have consistent levels of new supply and almost 3000 units per quarter coming out. Moving over to the west coast. Overall the first quarter revenue results in Seattle were as expected. On our last call, we told you that we experienced moderation in the fourth quarter of 2017 and expected that moderation to continue into 2018 and it has. Occupancy for the first quarter was 95.7% which is 10 basis points less in Q1 2017, and renewals average 5.7%. Well, it\u2019s still early in the season our ability to grow rate is somewhat less than we expected. The good news is the vibrancy of the job market in Seattle remains strong. Amazon continues to show strength and the initial pause from HQ2 had announcement last year is definitely in the past, as today we see over 5,400 open Seattle positions under website. Today our occupancy in Seattle is 95.9%, which continues to be about 10 basis points less than last year and our base rents are down 1.6% as compared to the same week that year. We expect our renewals for April to be 5.8%, and May is trending towards 5.6%. Demand remain strong and the current moderation of pricing power is something that we will continue to keep a close eye on as we move through the leasing season. Moving down to San Francisco, we said on the earnings call in January that this is the market that has the most potential to outperform, our same store revenue growth expectation for the year and we still believe that to be the case. We continue to see positive news about employment growth in announcements of new job creation. The tech giant\u2019s expansion continues unabated and venture capital spending is on the rise with $6.4 billion being placed in Q1, which was up 23% from Q4 2017. Our Q1 result in San Francisco were better than expected, primarily driven by our ability to grow occupancy early to gain modest pricing power in advance of the leasing season. We averaged 96.4% occupancy for the quarter, which was 60 basis points better than Q1 of 2017, renewals were up 4.2%. The Peninsula and South Bay are performing the best, South Bay is benefiting from a low and new supply at that sub market is back half loaded with deliveries. Today we are 96% occupied in San Francisco, which is 30 basis points better than the same week last year, and our base lines are up 3.9% versus last year. This week will mark the eighth consecutive week of incremental increases through our base rents our renewals for April are up 5.5% and we expect May to be up 5.3%. Trends up being positive, but it is still early and I look forward to adding additional color on this market in the July earnings call. As we\u2019ve discussed prior calls, Los Angeles is a market with significant increase in supply and while it's a large geographic area almost 60% of this new supply will be concentrated in the downtown metro area where we have 18% of our NOI. Employment growth is diverse and remain strong. Jobs related to online content creation continue to ramp up with Netflix, Apple and Amazon making investments into the area from Hollywood to Culver City. This along with continued strength and expansion of Silicon Beach are aiding in the absorption of the new supply. But we know that the volume of new supply may become a pressure point against our pricing power in 2018. And that is our ROI guidance was a strategy of increasing occupancy early to position us to raise rates beginning in March. For the quarter, we had 96.1% occupancy which was 40 basis points higher than Q1 of 2017 and renewals were up 5.6%. Overall our results were marginally better than expected, but we are still early in the season and the ability to maintain pricing power will be challenged. Our occupancy in LA today is 95.9%, which is 30 basis points better than the same week last year. Our base rents are up 4.6% year-over-year and we expect a 5.9% increased on renewals in April and are trending to 6.1% from May. Moving for Orange County, first quarter results were in line with expectations. Occupancy for the quarter was 96.2%, which was 10 basis points higher than Q1 of 2017 and renewals were at 6.3%. Today, we are experiencing pressure on pricing and occupancy at a level greater than we expected for April. And it's being created from the lease-ups in Irvine area. Our occupancy is 95.5%, which is 80 basis points lower than the same week last year. Our base rents are up 1.7% and our renewals are up just over 5% for both April and May. Demand remain strong and this trend does have a potential to recover through the leasing season. And last, but not least San Diego. Our results for the quarter were slightly less than expected, almost entirely due to the occupancy of 95.8%, which was 30 basis points lower than last year. Renewals in the quarter were up 5.7%, military spending remains strong in the area, but we are also facing several lease-ups in the downtown area. Qualcomm, Dan Diego seventh largest employer also just announced that they will be cutting just over 1,200 jobs in the market. And while this news is a negative for the market a quick search of our residence with suggests the impact of our portfolio would be minimal. Today our San Diego occupancy is 96.2% which is 30 basis points higher than the same week last year. Our base rents are up 3.9%, our renewals for April are at 6% and May is trending towards 6.0%  So to summarize all you sitting here today, we continue to see strong demand and we are well positioned but leasing season. We have New York and San Francisco trending modestly ahead, Seattle and Orange County a bit behind and the rest of the markets on track and performing as expected. In closing, I want to give a quick shout out to the entire equity team. Their excitement and readiness for this leasing season is felt throughout the entire organization. Their ability to deliver remarkable experiences to our residents is evident through our strong renew results, and tens of thousands of survey results received. Renewing our residents in the face of elevated supply remains the team's number one goal. Our sincere thank you to each of you that the work that you do each and every day. Thank you, David? David Neithercut : Thank, Michael. Angel will open the call for Q&A now please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go ahead for first question from Juan Sanabria of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Juan Sanabria : Hi, Good morning, thanks for the time. Just on the same store revenues, which you expected to trajectory some here throughout the rest of 2018, do you still see the decline in the second and third quarter mainly due to supply and when do you think same store revenue growth on a year-over-year basis will stabilize? Mark Parrell : Hey, Juan its Mark Parrell. So the answer to that really depends on how the leasing season goes. And as Michael Manelis and David Santee just said, we're well positioned going into the leasing season, and so we would hope that our quarter-over-quarter number for the second quarter would be just modestly lower than the number we just reported and then the rest of the year to be approximately equivalent again if we have a good leasing season. If the leasing season is less strong than the numbers will decline towards the back half for year quarter-over-quarter. Juan Sanabria : Okay. And then they declined is \u2013 quarter-over-quarter decline and you're saying is down on the year-over-year numbers 2018 versus 2017? Mark Parrell : Yes. Juan Sanabria : Okay. Got you. And then just on the upside and downside risk for the 2018 same-store revenue numbers, where is that risk is in a concessions in New York or with all Long Island City and Brooklyn supply. And if you could speak to that or what\u2019s more it represents to downside risk from here to the numbers? What will have to happen? Michael Manelis : Yes, well. This is Michael. So I guess I would tell you that just based on the commentary, I mean, we have markets with elevated supply coming at us and we\u2019re entering the peak leasing season in the position were Orlando would be \u2013 but our risk clearly, I mean, we denoted that I think on the last call is New York. We also have LA with \u2013 as elevated supply and while it\u2019s doing well in the absorption and we\u2019re positioned well. Those are markets as we go through the peak leasing season that can have a lot of weight on a full year performance. Juan Sanabria : Okay. How is New York and Manhattan being insulated as it is from supply in Long Island City and Brooklyn? Michael Manelis : Yes. So again, we kind of look at this in a couple different ways \u2013 so we know the elevated supply is concentrated with 11,000 of the 19,000 units being in Brooklyn and Long Island City. And as we think about kind of that performance, we\u2019re looking at former residents, the forwarding address that they give us and I think, we said to-date, we have not seen any impact from Long Island city supply. We did a trailing 12-month view back in February and at that time, we had less than 1% of our move-outs, providing us with forwarding address in Long Island city. And we just updated that from a year-to-date basis that trend has continued with less than 1% of our move-outs having that address. So to-date I would say, the absorption in both Brooklyn and Long Island city is better than what we expected. And it is not impacting the performance in Manhattan and even in our Brooklyn portfolio. Sitting here today for the quarter, we have better position than what we would have thought given the amount of elevated supply that we are facing. Juan Sanabria : Thank you. David Neithercut : You\u2019re welcome, Juan. Operator : Your next question comes from Nick Yulico of UBS. Please go ahead. Nick Yulico : Thanks. David Neithercut, I guess question on supply in 2019. I think you and a lot of others in industry have \u2013 as point to supply showing off in 2019 at some point, in terms of delivery, part of the data providers is showing that as well. However, we got some senses your update to national level that shows supply permits and starts from multi-family still doing a bit high since last week. So I guess, yes, how are you thinking about that latest as they came out, as it post some risk on the supply picture still being elevated through 2019. David Neithercut : Well, I think that the data you\u2019re referring to \u2013 Nick is national data and the data we give you is that which we see where specifically not just on markets. But in the footprints that we believe compete with our assets. So nothing\u2019s changed from our perspective, with respect to supply we do seeing generally, significantly in some markets like New York. But generally, across our footprint notwithstanding what may be happening across the entire country. Nick Yulico : Okay. And then just question on capital use, as I think, you had recently or are in the process of having your annual board meeting, where you talk about where you think NAV is for the stock and how that would take your capital strategies and I guess latest thoughts on how you think about it as some of the development pipeline is really slowed in spending as slowed as well. You reserves \u2013 the excess free cash flow there whether it goes to upgrade or did it then grows to stock buyback, other uses, how should we think about your order of priorities, right now? David Neithercut : Well, let me first say it, that\u2019s not an annual conversation, it\u2019s a quarterly conversation with respect to my deployment of capital. And we did in fact have that in our most recent meeting in March. And Mark went through just the cash flow and as know the fact that their cash flow allocated to development is coming down considerably, which it does create some more optionality with respect to where to invest that. And we\u2019ve taken them through the choices and all those conversations are ongoing. Nothing is changed at the present time. I think it\u2019s a \u2013 as I shared with the investment community on this call many times over the last year or so. We\u2019re certainly aware of where we trade relative to what the Street things and then what we think are NAV is. We have watched stock back in the past. We won\u2019t hesitate to do so in the future. But it\u2019s our belief of where kind of that discount needs to be relative to many others, as just a wider discount. So we would continue to have 13 million shares available under our announced plan and at the appropriate time, we won\u2019t hesitate to take advantage of that. Nick Yulico : And I guess just following up lastly on that is, I mean do you think at some point of \u2013 if the stock had discount NAV, I mean, does it \u2013 do you think about selling even more to capitalize on what seems like so strong pricing in the private market versus where the stock is trading. And then also do you think about looking at perhaps some of the newer development you delivered where you don\u2019t have as much of a tax gain to deal with? And so perhaps that could be more attractive to sell some of the development, you delivered in New York City over the last several years for example. Mark Parrell : Yes. Hey, Nick, it\u2019s Mark. I appreciate you starting by noting that assets we\u2019ve owned implicitly room for a while have a great deal of tax gaining in fact the $300 million or so. We sold in the first quarter, I have about $210 million of gains just to give you a sense of \u2013 when you own assets, you buy right, you hold them for a while, you do have quite a bit again in them as well as our frequent use of 1031 exchanges. In terms of selling newer assets, whether it\u2019s New York or San Francisco, I mean those assets we think are the ones that will drive long-term growth for the company and its shareholders. We feel at some extent that you\u2019re selling your seed corn. We\u2019d suggest to you that if we sell these better assets in bulk and that would affect our multiple at some point as well. So again, it\u2019s not something as David said the board are financially teams are willing to give, but it just isn\u2019t costless either to sell even the newer assets that have less been in them. Michael Manelis : Yes. And I guess joining, I add to that. Nick is that the development that we\u2019ve done coming out of the great recession has been extraordinary profitable and notwithstanding the fact that it\u2019s brand new, we\u2019ve made a lot of money on those and there\u2019s a lot of built in gaining those assets as well. Nick Yulico : Thanks everyone. Michael Manelis : Thank you, Nick. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pawlowski of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. John Pawlowski : Thanks. Mark, I think last call you mentioned that 421-a burn-off in New York, it was got an increase 18 same-store expenses by 170 bps. Can you give us an update on what think were earn in that burn-off across your portfolio and will that impact a grow moderate or stay pretty consistent over the next couple years? Mark Parrell : Hey, John thanks for the question. Just to clarify the 1.7 percentage points of the fact is to real estate tax number, not for overall same-store expense growth, so just to give you a sense of that. That outcome will persist for a while. We have about 1.7 to 1.8 percentage points for the next three, four plus years in terms of these abatements burning-off. Again as I noted in the prior call, every increase in net abatement does certainly hurt us on same-store expense growth. But the assets become more valuable, the cap rate declined. So it\u2019s like you\u2019re paying off, any expense of loan of sorts. You are creating value in these assets. It\u2019s just not as visible to the P&L. John Pawlowski : Understood. And moving on to the Boston development, right across the street in TD Garden is that stated to still start this summer. And then could you \u2013 if it\u2019s \u2013 could you just remind us late 2021 delivery, I think you mention a low 6% stabilized yield. What kind of rent and construction cost growth rates are you underwriting between now and then? David Neithercut : You\u2019re correct on all that, John. And we\u2019re in the process of starting at, it will likely \u2013 I\u2019d expect that to be on the development schedule at our second quarter call. So we\u2019re now in the process of preparing the sites, the demolition of the garage. So we\u2019re for full steam ahead on the second quarter. So that is a $410 million of project. It is a \u2013 we do expect it will delivered in late 2021. And as you note, it is currently a low 6 or so \u2013 low 6% yield. On the construction costs, we are all sort of bided in. So we\u2019re not facing any meaningful \u2013 a lot of risk with respect to the construction cost and so I don\u2019t have at my fingertips, what we might be projecting for revenue growth there we feel very good about the market as Michael said in his opening remarks. But we\u2019re quite comfortable with that low 6% number. John Pawlowski : Okay. And then I know you\u2019ve been working on a deal for the better part of a decade. So is that could fall in construction cost of fully loaded number of that contemplates, all of the LIBOR corresponding to the deal? Mark Parrell : That contemplates all the capitalized costs that we\u2019ve been incurred during that timeframe. Yes, I bet your question. John Pawlowski : Okay. Thank you. Mark Parrell : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And your next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead. Nick Joseph : Thanks. David, you guys were active in the first quarter in terms of acquisitions and dispositions. Just wondering, if you\u2019re seen any change either in cap rates or buying interest across multi-family. David Neithercut : No, Nick. We continue to see a great deal of demand for the product we\u2019re willing to sell as well as for the product that we\u2019d be willing to buy. There may not be as many bidders but there\u2019s certainly sufficient number of bidders to continue to validate the pricing in the valuations that we\u2019ve been looking after quite some time. Nick Joseph : Thanks. So then guidance assumes 50 bps spread between the acquisition and disposition yield, most actually inverted I think 20 bps the other way in the first quarter. Was that something you need to the assets, if you sold relative to what you\u2019re expecting to sell remainder of the year? David Neithercut : Yes. We sold a deal in the Upper East side of Manhattan had a sub-three cap rate, which had a big impact on the weighted average cap rate for all the dispositions for the quarter. Nick Joseph : Thanks. And just finally on the good development that delivered, you increased the cost by about $20 million for amenity in apartment improvements. I just want to get your thoughts on why you did that and what the additional benefit of kind of increasing the scale of that loss. David Neithercut : Well, we just felt that putting the hard surface flooring and upgrading the kitchen cabinets, doing the countertops rather, I think stepping up the overall quality of some of the amenities all made sense to continue to have some cost relative to the late addition of air conditioning into that property. So they were all things that we felt made a great deal of sense for that property just given more pricing, it is there today. Nick Joseph : Thanks. David Neithercut : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your question comes from Rich Hightower of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Rich Hightower : Hi, good morning everybody. First really quickly just to congrats the David Santee on a long successful career at EQR, just wanted bring that up. It\u2019s been a real pleasure working with you. So on to the Q&A here, really quickly within the embedded guidance for the year, where do new and renewal rents factor into the guidance range. What are you assuming for those metrics? Mark Parrell : So for the full year, for the portfolio, the new lease changed guidance was at negative 60 basis points. Renewals were up 4.2%. Rich Hightower : Okay, perfect. And then just back to the question on discounts in NAV and share repurchases. So coming out of the fourth quarter earnings call and then coming out of the Citi Conference. The stock was much lower than where it is today. I think the commentary was a little more forceful in terms of the discounts NAV, there was a board meeting coming up. If you don\u2019t mind give us a little sense of maybe if any thinking at the board level change from one-time period to the other in the fact that no shares were repurchased in the interim period. Just help us understand the thinking there. Mark Parrell : I don\u2019t think there was any change in thinking Rich. Look at the board, I think very appropriately looks at the capital, Equity capital is very precious resource and while I understand the arithmetic just believe, again, that we\u2019ve done it in the past. And I think what we did in some of the stock we bought back in all 10-plus years ago. We were buying at 30% and 40% discount to replacement cost. That one only get limited opportunities as we\u2019ve talked about limited by sort of bites at this apple and we just felt like it was not appropriate at this time. I don\u2019t want for a minute to have anyone believe that we're unwilling to. I'm not sure anybody bought more stock backs than we have over the history of the company. As you know we returned a great deal of capital back to our shareholders in the big disposition strategy that we undertook in 2016. So these are \u2013 just there's not an unwillingness on our part, is just an \u2013 I believe that this discount needs to be greater than what it is today. Rich Hightower : Okay. Thanks for that guys. Mark Parrell : You're, welcome. Thank you, Rich. Operator : Your next question comes from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Rich Hill : Hey, good morning guys. I'm sorry if you've disclosed this previously. Obscure fresh on what your rent to income ratios are across your portfolio? Mark Parrell : Yes, we can. The number has been fairly consistent David. David Neithercut : Yes. I mean \u2013 over the years we've always used kind of the same multiplier. So the percentages don't necessarily change over the past two years the most notable change that we've seen was in Seattle, where rents had grown but the absolute level of grants have been lower, but you've seen this influx of high paying tech jobs. So over the past two or three years Seattle was kind of come down in near \u2013 New York City which is our lowest at 17% of rent to income. Everything else is kind of in the 20s and we're at 22% rent to income to that. Rich Hill : Got it. Mark Parrell : That\u2019s been pretty consistent for quite some time. And in the low 20s given the portfolio we have today. Rich Hill : Got it. And so when I hear those numbers, I don't see any issue with continued pressure to push rents you would agree with that? Mark Parrell : Well not from an income standpoint. Rich Hill : Yes, correct. Mark Parrell : From a supply chain, but not from an income standpoint now. Rich Hill : Got it. And one more question on the job front you guys have a really great chart. I guess on Page 27 on one of your recent decks, illustrating that your medium resident age is 33 and primarily focused on millennials. I'm curious how much is population migrations factoring into some of the job growth that you're seeing. You mentioned Boston, is it really job growth that\u2019s driving this or jobs becoming \u2013 or jobs coming, because you're seeing population migrations to certain markets. I came to think that given your millennial population you're in a really interesting position to maybe address that question? Mark Parrell : Well, I guess my question will difference that makes. A lot of the businesses are going to the talent, and the talent is going to these high densities urban environments and so therefore the companies are having to go there. So \u2013 I mean we're just seeing very. very, very strong absorption of this new supply it negatively impacts pricing power, we believe that the tide will turn from 2019. But we're seeing an extraordinary absorption of this new product, certainly from millennials having and profound impact but as I \u2013 we have mentioned a lot of the our nearly 20% of our residents are 50 years of age and older. So we really do believe that we have appeal to anyone who's interested in living that sort of high density urban lifestyle. Rich Hill : Got it. And so maybe putting on inside, are you seeing these signs of population migration out of New York City? We've heard anecdotally some of that, but we personally haven't seen a lot of evidence of it yet. Are you seeing any signs of population migration out of high cost areas? David Neithercut : Well, I guess people try, if you look at the larger SMSA that may be the case, but that doesn't mean that you're not adding population in the urban core, but you may be losing population in some of these markets within the entire footprint of SMSA, but we continue to see what we think is increases in households in density in the urban core. I think Washington State is a perfect example. I mean much of the new construct has been in the district to district is now providing a lifestyle, but it not been available for a long time and you're seeing extraordinary growth within the urban core of the of the district. Rich Hill : Got it. Really, really helpful guys. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you. David Neithercut : Thank you, Rich. Operator : Your next question comes from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. John Kim : Thanks, good morning. In New York the 32BJ, union of workers\u2019 strike was recently inverted have an agreement on salary increases. And I'm wondering how much of the Union impacted in your New York portfolio and also if you could just give us an update on what you think labor cost growth over the next couple years? David Santee : This is David Santee. Yes. We\u2019ve seen \u2013 we renegotiated contract best part \u2013 if you want to call it elevated payroll growth for this year. We have a very good team that works very closely with 32BJ, hence lot of these 421-a buildings require unionized labor. As far \u2013 what was the second part of your question? John Kim : Do you see this issue in other markets are there in New York? David Santee : Just overall labor. I mean well \u2013 if you look \u2013 overall our labor costs in our industry we've talked about this for the past couple of years, but when you're building 10,000 units, 20,000 units in New York, you\u2019re creating tremendous numbers of jobs in our industry. I would tell you that with the impact of retail our ability to attract and retain our office folks has been fairly reasonable. But on the service side with levels of construction, some of the immigration issues, some of the high costs in some of these urban cores it becomes more challenging do to attract and retain the service side of the equation. So when you look at our overall salary growth this year I mean office, administrative function is very much in line, but we're seeing the elevation on the service side. Mark Parrell : And John just to give you some more detail, it's Mark for New York. If real estate taxes were really driving. So New York reported a 5.3% quarter-over-quarter number. They did an exceptional job managing payroll in New York and it was flat for the quarter. It was really about real estate taxes being up 13% and dragging that number up. John Kim : Okay. Thank you for that. And then turning to the development pipeline, it\u2019s now stands at $1 billion which is less than half, it was the couple years ago, and it\u2019s very consistent with what your guys saying. But how low are you comfortable with the pipelines going to give the core confident competency, but development cost remains elevated. Mark Parrell : Well. Its $1 billion pipeline, but what is truly under construction is meaningfully less than that. I mean we're comfortable having that development pipeline be whatever it needs to be. That allows us to commit capital in appropriate sort of risk adjusted manner. Development remains core competency, we've got terrific group of development folks in each of our kind of core markets they continue to look at product for us, and it\u2019s difficult to actually justify any sort of transactions today. They do other work for us, they've been involved in capital projects deals, and they even work underwriting potential acquisitions. So it's a group of people of resource that will retain, and we'll look forward to building that business back up, but only if we want to make sense to do so. We're not going to change products just because we've got folks who would like to be building it. We put those folks who work and doing some other things in addition to them underwriting product and all the time will come and we\u2019ll look forward to doing that business backup. John Kim : Great. Thank you. Mark Parrell : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you. Yes, David discussed, best in your next and the assume that your handicap will improve. Just two questions. First, David Neithercut you mentioned the Sub 3 on the UPREIT side which sounds like that asset had a lot of growth in it. So if you can comment on how you think about selling assets that may have a lot of embedded growth and how that effects FFO growth for the company, but also given \u2013 I would assume the desire to have a mix of assets in your markets of As and Bs. How selling an asset like this fits into that strategy of trying to straddle a number of price points to maximize the portfolios performance. David Neithercut : Well. I guess you presumed there's a lot of growth in that because of the cap rate. Obviously we feel it was less a growth in that \u2013 and that the asset and perhaps the buyer did at. I think that there's a great deal of demand across the space today for \u201cvalue add product\u201d and I think this fits squarely in that. While we're certainly capable of undertaking that work ourselves, oftentimes we think someone will pay us a nice premium to take better risk and work on them and this is one of those situations. And then just, I mean take an example of the kind of trading that we've communicated the street that we're \u2013 they should expect us to be doing by selling assets that we believe will be slower growth and reallocating that capital hopefully assets that will be higher growth. And it be interesting to note that we were under contract to buy another asset a much newer asset in the New York metropolitan area, not in Manhattan specifically but in the New York metropolitan areas. So it's not a retreat from New York but it\u2019s just the reallocation of the capital in New York. And what we own properties across sort of the spectrum in terms of quality, we're not \u2013 I like to consider ourselves as agnostic in that regard, well certainly we've got a lot of very good quality property, we also do have these and perhaps even a season where the process of bringing to be. So we're happy to invest across the spectrum. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second question is. You guys have 25% of your exposure in California the rent control proposition seem to be gaining steam. So if you could just comment one on how you guys are viewing it, efforts and your thoughts on if this does succeed how this impacts the growth profile of your California assets? David Neithercut : Well. California does represent a meaningful share of our invested capital one of our revenue and net operating income and we were working very closely with the group that includes other public reach and other large private owners of multifamily. To address this referendum to appeal the cost of Hawkins' law. And for those who are unfamiliar with that, cost to Hawkins's is the law in the state of California that limits rent control only up to be delivered before February 1995. And it restricts, it actually requires vacancy decontrol on those properties are subject to rent control. So it's important to note, the rent control exists in California today, and municipalities can adopt rent control today, it is just subject to cost of Hawkins. So while we certainly don't think the repeal cost of Hawkins's is a good thing, we also don't think that it's a disaster, because you can have rent control today many, many, many municipalities have decided or opted not to. And in those that have actually been on the ballot measures over the past several years many, many of those have actually been defeated. So it's certainly something that we're watching very closely. We\u2019re aligned with the our peers and others that have got to significant investments in multifamily in California and also to see where it goes. Alexander Goldfarb : But you have a view on what do us with the rent profile? Your growth? David Neithercut : Well, again may cost to Hawkins is not introducing rent control. So the fact that cost to Hawkins is repeal does not mean every municipality which we operate will automatically adopt rent control. So most of our cost to Hawkins has to be repealed and then municipalities have to decide whether or not they want to adopt some form of rent control an option that they currently have, but again I mentioned many of them don't. So it's very difficult to sort of tell you what the impact would be. I could tell you if you wanted to ask them keep a particular municipality adopted rent control what that impact might be, but this sort of suggests would be an entire state would be impossible. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Omotayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Omotayo Okusanya : Yes. Good morning. Two quick ones from me. First one I just wanted to confirm for the quarter interest in other income was about $5.8 million. It seems to be like someone time item and then could you just let us know what that was and whether that being backed out of normalized FFO per share? David Neithercut : Thanks, Tayo. Here is a schedule we prepare for that on Page 22 and those are lawsuitsthat were settled in our favor relating to some development activities, but we do take those out of those recoveries in our favor out or normalized FFO and that is on Page 22 that $5.3 million almost all of that is really that nature. Omotayo Okusanya : Okay. All right. That\u2019s helpful. So that\u2019s number one. And then number two, heading into spring leasing season. I know it\u2019s just a April assets point, but any insight assets point, that you can give into a new lease rent growth. I mean its sound like it was negative again in 1Q and just some sense of if it\u2019s possible for it to turn positive in 2Q or given the supply constraint just to kind of processor making that\u2019s a statement. Michael Manelis : Yes. So this is Michael. I do want to started out and I wanted to share \u2013 I do not believe that looking at the results for just the first quarter is the best way to think about, there\u2019s new lease change metric. I will tell you that every market others in Seattle and Orange County was on track or slightly ahead with our Q4 \u2013 Q1 forecast, even though those were negative numbers. And really there has been no change to our full year new lease guidance assumptions that we shared in the investor presentation back in March. I can also tell you that Seattle and Orange County, which we talked about. We\u2019re also offset by greater than expected performance on the renewal side. And since the volume of transactions during this quarter is low, a lot of this stuff can change on us. We start moving through the leasing season. And I think what you just alluded to if you just go back to some of the commentary for each one of these markets. We are on like our eighth consecutive week of incremental rent increases, week over week over week and that absolutely manifest itself into improvement in this new lease change. But sitting here today like we look at that every single week, this last week we were positive. Doesn\u2019t mean that that friend old, it doesn\u2019t mean that it can\u2019t get even more positive, but that those are the kind of indicators that we have right now in the fact that rents have been moving up, kind of do help fuel performance on the new lease change metric. Omotayo Okusanya : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. David Neithercut : You bet, Tayo. Operator : Your next question will come from Dennis McGill of Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead. Dennis McGill : Hi, thank you guys. First question, so just carrying forward on the new lease questionnaire, I appreciate the clarification. But do you have what the new lease \u2013 in the first quarter and then how that spans across markets. David Neithercut : Yes, sure. So I\u2019m just going out kind of rattled off I will tell you for the entire portfolio same-store we were negative 2.6%. And I\u2019ll just move kind of market by market real quick. So Boston was down 4.2%, New York was down 5%, Washington D.C. was down 4.8%, Seattle was down 4.5%, San Francisco down 1.5%, Los Angeles was positive 20 basis points, Orange County was negative 40 basis points, San Diego was positive 50 basis points. And again I just want to make sure everybody realizes that standalone quarter is not a really good indicator and I think we\u2019re more relevant as whether or not the assumptions for the full year are changing based on what has occurred in the first quarter and outside of that trajectory for Seattle and Orange County, I will tell you these are exactly where we expected them to be. Dennis McGill : That\u2019s very helpful. And just for comparison sort of minus 2, 6 across the whole portfolio that\u2019s comparable to what you just referenced has been slightly positive in the most recent week. David Neithercut : Yes. So I don\u2019t have that in front of me, but I think we were positive 20 basis points for the last week for the entire portfolio and that will be saved metric. Dennis McGill : Okay, thank you. And then second question, can you maybe to share what you\u2019re hearing and seen with respect to capital availability for the development side. David Neithercut : Well, I think everybody just only has sort of anecdotal sort of things about that. Dennis, I can tell you that we have received \u2013 so our investment team has received inquiries about our interest in providing some equity capital for developments from sponsors that never would have called us 12 or 18 months ago. We\u2019ve just \u2013 we\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve heard about things being marked all and things being put on the back burner et cetera. Now that doesn\u2019t mean that well capitalized people can\u2019t find the capital. Can\u2019t find the institutional partners, we\u2019ve heard of some big institutions sort of stepping aside. Mark can you talk about maybe other debt side. Mark Parrell : Sure. So what we\u2019ve seen is generally steady, ability of developers who are able to obtain equity to finance themselves in the debt market. At this point, we see some banks for example, Fifth Third just announced that they are reducing their multifamily lending, the other banks we survey generally say they\u2019re going to be in about the same places, they\u2019ve been in the recent past. There may be a touch more focus on suburban deals that are tending to pencil better. So that they're doing a little bit more development in the suburban areas that are being financed, but it doesn't seem that the banks are the restrictor at the Equity. Because the banks are only loaning it, 50% to 60%, so it's easy for them to make that loan and feel confidence, the Equity that set material risk. It get us really quickly. I mean, if you just have a situation where development costs continue to rise, rental rates continue to be pressured, yields, note to yields getting compressed and adjusted. We just think it's going to a point, where a lot of equity is having their sidelines. Dennis McGill : Okay. And just follow-up with \u2013 if you look at the non-bank resources. Is there anything that would vary from what you just talked about sort of this stable availability? David Neithercut : Yes, there is more. And there is certainly more involvement from them. But they're capital so expensive that they're more of a substitute for that for the equity than they are for the deck. And again, they are pretty pricey alternative. So again, well the cost pressures, we just see this general cracking down of yields and IRRs in with revenue growth being modest across the country. We do just generally feel like those numbers are just not going to add up and we would expect them to decline over time. Dennis McGill : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Wes Golladay : Hi, guys. Just a follow-up to that last question. Have you expect to see a meaningful uptick in current developers getting in trouble, the whole backdrop are right in cost, higher financing costs delay. What you seeing on the ground? David Neithercut : I guess we've not seen much, really if any of that at least at this juncture. As we mentioned earlier, the products, projects that have been delivered are being absorbed. They may not be achieving the rental rates that they might have expected. But they're being absorbed and my guess is that there being they're far from being in distress. They may not be making their every return that they had hoped. They may not be able to refinance out every sort of nickel of construction loan that they had had hoped. But I mean, we're a long way fighting from this distress in the space, just given the \u2013 a very, very strong demand that we're seeing for good quality multi-family today. Wes Golladay : Okay. What if we fast-forward, call it two years from now, if you\u2019re having a hard time penciling in developments and I\u2019d say you have a purpose superior to your cost of the capital, you just raised that around 3.6 pertained to your money. You see the people are going to bode down the date getting that any issues? David Neithercut : I mean, again, if they're breaking ground today and they're being finance, as Mark said, it 50% or 60% there. They're not going to be distressed, they may not achieve their equity returns. But they will not be in distress. Mark Parrell : Yes, just to give a little color around that. We're seeing spreads of 250 to 300 basis points above LIBOR. LIBOR is around 2%, we call it 450. You imagine that rates are up 2%, you could have a situation where the debt rate of developer is staying at 6% and 6.5%. That said, there are underwriting the debt yields of 7% or 8%. So I think the lenders are \u2013 at 50% leverage are probably okay. I think the equity, we will get pinched at some point and you feel it. But I think the lenders at this low leverage. Frankly, as David said, probably in adequate position or coverage. Wes Golladay : Okay. And then looking at the deliveries for the peak leasing season, that share many of the markets. Do you see any risk at least \u2013 at some markets, where it will be \u2013 can be pushing at the back half of the year, where it's not ideal? David Neithercut : Any of the new product being pushed in the back half of the year, there is plenty of product being delivered every quarter, that it's \u2013 whether or not something's opens their doors, 30 or 60 or 90 days later than expected is not going to be a windfall for the states. I mean, there's just \u2013 a lot of product kind of coming and when something opens its door, I\u2019m not choosing have much of an impact. Wes Golladay : Okay. Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Obviously, you guys are reforming the portfolio from a geographic perspective last year. And I\u2019m just curious, if you\u2019re the board had any thoughts about reconsidering markets. Are you pretty contend on kind of the markets you\u2019re currently in? David Neithercut : I think the board asks us Steve, on a regular basis to sort of test our thesis and it have asked us repeatedly, if you were to add some additional markets, what might they be? And why are you not entering those today? If you look at the heat map, we've shared in all of our brochures that there are certainly some markets that on some characteristics. Look I think very attractive for one reason or another either too small or single-family home ownership is price of single family homes as is too cheap or whatever. But we are not committed, we\u2019re not choose to lose stone, where we are if it makes sense for us to add another market or two. We won't hesitate to do it and we continue to do that work to determine whether or not that's meant in our shareholders' best interests or not. Steve Sakwa : David, could you just maybe share with us kind of the one or two markets that you might go back into where and would you go into that through acquisition or through development? David Neithercut : Well, look, I guess, one of the things that we have to be thoughtful about Steve is just given our size for us to go \u201cinto a market\u201d. We've acquires a very meaningful amount of capital to have it make sense for Michael and his team and for investment team and for all the support that one needs to give. So my guess, if we went into a market, it would be with a hopefully, some sort of portfolio acquisition that would then be supplemented by one-off acquisitions. And certainly, we would consider development. I would say that Denver is a market that when we exited that market as part of the large sale of the assets to various \u2013 Starwood several years ago. We\u2019d always consider that not to be a market exit but rather to be a portfolio exit. It was a portfolio of 30-year old quite suburban, surface park walkup kind of product that we knew we would not own long term. We did not see at the way at the time. So having this sort of portfolio that we want to have in that marketplace and so we took advantage of what we thought was very attractive pricing to sell those assets. And it's certainly a market that we would consider going back into if I want to make sense to pick so. Steve Sakwa : Great. Thanks very much, appreciate the time. Operator : Gentlemen, there are no further question at this time. I\u2019d like to hand it back over to Mr. McKenna for closing remarks. Marty McKenna : And I will thank you very much everyone. I'll let you know that David Santee will be in attendance at the NAREIT's meetings in New York and you'll all get a chance to say a goodbye and wish David well and we look forward to seeing everybody at that meeting in June in New York. Thank you so much for your time today. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

Today\u2019s presentation is being recorded. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the floor over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead, sir. Marty McKenna : Thank you, Catherine. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential\u2019s second quarter 2018 operating results. Our featured speakers today are David Neithercut, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Parrell, our Chief Financial Officer; David Santee is here with us as well. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to David Neithercut. David Neithercut : Thanks, Marty. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us for today\u2019s call. We\u2019re extremely pleased with the Company\u2019s operating performance to date as we move towards the tail end of our primary leasing season. Because continued strong demand across the board for rental housing and the relentless attention to customer service delivered each and every day by our outstanding property management teams, combined maintained very high levels of occupancy and record setting resident retention that have enabled us to now expect to deliver growth in same-store revenue towards the high end of our original expectations. With elevated levels of new supply across our markets this year, we had prepared ourselves for modest reductions in occupancy and weaker growth, but it was going to be a -- because it was going to be a very competitive marketplace for new prospective residents and our existing residents, we have a lot of options from which to choose when their lease would come up for renewal. Yet very deep and resilient demand for apartment living in our urban and highly walkable suburban markets continues to be the story. And here, to take you into greater detail is our recently promoted Chief Operating Officer, Michael Manelis. Michael Manelis : Thank you, David. So, similar to the trend we discussed on the last call, the overall demand for our product remains strong through the leasing, despite the elevated supply. Our team\u2019s ability to execute along with continued job growth has put us in a position to exceed expected revenue results for this quarter and increase our full year revenue growth expectations to 2.1%. New York and San Francisco are driving the majority of the overall guidance increase. For the second quarter, we reported 96.2% occupancy. Our new lease change was up 1.4%, and achieved renewal increases were up 4.7%. All three of these metrics were above our original expectations. I\u2019d like to take a minute and recognize our on-site teams. Renewing our residents in the pace of elevated supply has been the team\u2019s number one goal. Not only did they deliver a 4.7% achieved increase on renewal, but they also managed to reduce turnover again to 13.4% for the quarter, while increasing our overall resident satisfaction, the highest levels we have seen in the history of our Company. In addition to being the lowest turnover percent that we have ever reported in the second quarter, when you net out on-site transfers that is residents who are moving to a new unit within the same community, this number drops another 150 basis points to 11.9%. Their ability to deliver remarkable service to our residents is an inspiration to all of us here, and I can\u2019t tell you how proud I\u2019m of all of them. So, now, onto the markets. Let\u2019s start with Boston. Gains and occupancy, 20 basis-point revenue boost from parking income and a continued ability of the market to absorb the new supply has given us the confidence to increase our full-year revenue guidance midpoint for this market by 50 basis points to 2.1%. Our occupancy for the quarter was 96.3% in Boston, which was 50 basis points higher than our original expectations and 60 basis points better than Q2 of \u201817. As of this morning, our Boston base rents are up 2.7% as compared to the same week last year and renewal performance remains strong with 4.8% achieved increases in the second quarter. July is trending to a 5.1% and August is projected to be 5.2%. Moving over to New York. Consistency in operations and disciplined market pricing are the highlights for this quarter. 96.8% occupancy for the quarter was 70 basis points better than both expectations and that of the second quarter of 2017. Achieved increases on renewals were 30 basis points better than expected at 2.8%. Our use of concessions in New York remains very limited and strategic. Our second quarter concessions were 37% lower than that of the second quarter of 2017. And for the past several months, we have only had approximately 5% to 10% of our weekly applications receive some form of moving concessions. We remain focused on competitive net effective pricing and the use of confessions at our stabilized assets will remain targeted, but it is expected to increase in the softer demand period, later in the year. Full-year revenue guidance for New York is being increased by almost 100 basis points from negative 75 basis points to a positive 20 basis points. Today, our occupancy in New York is 96.7%, which is 70 basis points higher than the same week last year. Base rents are up 2.9% year-over-year, and this week is the 14th consecutive week of base rents being positive on a year-over-year basis and the 5th consecutive week being above 2%. Achieved increases on renewals remain strong with 3.2% expected in July and 3.4% for August. So, strong demand and disciplined market pricing in New York positioned us well for the peak leasing season. This provided us the opportunity to both, raise rate and grow occupancy. That being said, we are not out of the woods yet as the third quarter is the peak delivery quarter for New York . Now, these deliveries are concentrated in Long Island City and Brooklyn were to date, we have not seen a significant impact to our operations. Our New York team has performed extremely well through the leasing season, and we like our position here heading into a softer period of activity. Main headline for Washington DC continues to be positive economic conditions have aided in the absorption of new supply, but the overall DC continues to be a market with minimal pricing power. That being said, this is a market that\u2019s going to continue to deliver almost 3,000 units per quarter through the end of 2019. Pricing power will remain pressured until we either see a decrease in supply or an increase in jobs above the 40,000 per year level. Our second quarter revenue growth in DC was slightly better than our original expectations, primarily driven by 96.3% occupancy, which was 60 basis points better than expectations and 80 basis points better than Q2 of \u201817. Renewals were 30 basis points below expectations with an achieved increase of 4.1% for the quarter. Today, our occupancy in DC is at 96.3%, which is 10 basis points higher than the same week last year, and our base rents are 3.4% up year-over-year. We expect to achieve a 4.5% increase on renewals in July and 4.7% increase for August. We have revised our full-year revenue projection for Washington DC for 1.2%, which is a 20 basis-point increase from our original expectation at the beginning of the year. Moving over to the West Coast. Our overall second quarter revenue results in Seattle were slightly below our original expectations. On our last call, we told you that we were experiencing continued moderation and that our ability to grow rate was less than expected. That trend has continued through the second quarter, and we are not seeing signs of pricing power improvement, typically observed during the peak leasing season. Occupancy for the second quarter was 95.8%, which mirrored Q2 of \u201817 and was 10 basis points less than our expectations. Achieved renewal increases for Seattle averaged 5.9% for the quarter, which was also 10 basis points less than what we expected. The Seattle job market remains strong, which has helped in the absorption of the new units, but we expect continued rate pressure from the new supply through the remainder of the year. The good news on the supply front is that the 2019 supply is less concentrated in any one submarket, which should allow modest pricing power to return to our portfolio. Today, our occupancy in Seattle is 95.6%, which is 30 basis points lower than the same week last year and our base rents are down 1.7% year-over-year. We expect our achieved renewal increase to be 6.3% for July and August is trending towards 5.5%. We have adjusted our Seattle\u2019s full-year revenue growth projection down 25 basis point to 3% to reflect lower-than-expected base rent growth. Moving down to San Francisco. Pricing power and occupancy gains fueled by strong demand has resulted in another quarter of outperformance versus our original expectations. We have said in the past that market had the indicators that it could outperform the high-end of our guidance range. We now expect our full-year same-store revenue growth for San Francisco to be 2.9%. San Francisco\u2019s occupancy average 96.2% for the quarter, which was 40 basis points better than expected and 50 basis points better than Q2 of \u201817. Achieved increases on renewals were up 5.2%, which was 100 basis points better than we expected. Job growth remains strong in the Bay Area, 2.1%, and is really fueling the demand and aiding in the absorption of the new supply. Our own newly developed community 855 Brannan in downtown San Francisco is a great example of the strength of this market. This community is expected to destabilize approximately six months earlier than we initially thought. Today, 855 Brannan is at 95% occupancy, and we just renewed 54% of all of our June and July expirations with an achieved increase of 4.2%. Overall, the new deliveries in downtown San Francisco will be limited in the third and fourth quarters. The bulk of our competing products is already delivered and is currently in lease up. Another example of the strength of this market is the fact that our own performance in the Peninsula with 28% of our Bay Area NOI, remained strong in the pace of steady year-to-date supply delivery. We estimate that the Peninsula deliveries will decline by 70% in 2019, which should provide a favorable tailwind to already strong performance. Today, we are 95.9% occupied in San Francisco, identical to where we were the same week last year. Our base rents are up 6.1% year-over-year. Our achieved renewal increases for July are at 5.5% and we project 5.4% increase for August. Moving further down the West Coast, I am pleased to report that Los Angeles, which accounts for almost 30% of our portfolio-wide revenue growth, produced second quarter results, slightly ahead of our expectations. We mentioned on previous calls that we had a strategy to increase occupancy early in the year to not only position us to raise rates but as a defensive move against the elevated supply in this market. For the quarter, we had 96.0% occupancy, which was 20 basis points higher than our original expectations and 30 basis points higher than the second quarter of \u201817. Achieved renewal increases for the quarter in LA were up 6.2%. In the past, we\u2019ve been asked a lot of questions about delays in deliveries impacting our results. We have explained our process and outlined how from an operation standpoint we also focus on when first units begin leasing. Our response has been consistent and that we were not seeing delays beyond the typical 10% to 15% moves between quarters. Specific to LA, this quarter marks the first time we are seeing above-average shift in the timing of deliveries. It is hard to quantify the exact benefits of this shift as we still had over 4,000 units begin leasing activity in the first half of \u201818 but we do recognize that our performance during the first half of the year was impacted in a positive manner since the delivery pressure was not as an intense as expected. Our occupancy in LA today 96.6%, which is 10 basis points lower than the same week last year. Our base rents are up 5.6% year-over-year, and we expect 6.5% increase on renewals for both July and August. Based on modest gains in occupancy, stronger pricing power above our original expectations, along with increased potential pressure in the second half of the year due to the supply shift, we have revised our full-year revenue projection to 3.4%. This would have been a 3.5% increase, but as we\u2019ve disclosed in the release, during the second quarter, we had a onetime write-off from the retail tenant vacancy that will impact the full-year results in this market by 10 basis points. Moving to Orange County. Second quarter results were below expectations, primarily due to lower occupancy and lack of pricing power from lease-up pressure in the quarter. Occupancy for the quarter was 95.9%, which was 40 basis points lower than both expectations and that of the second quarter of \u201817. Achieved renewal increases for the quarter were 5.4%, which was 80 basis points lower than what we expected. Today, we continue to see moderate pressure on pricing in Orange County but our occupancy has recovered to 96.6%, which is 40 basis points higher than the same week last year. Our base rents are up 1.9% year-over-year, and achieved increases on renewals are up 5.9% for July and trending to 5.6% for August. Given the lack of pricing power experienced year-to-date along with revised expectations going forward, we have adjusted our Orange County full-year revenue growth projection down 50 basis points to 3.5%. While this was not as robust of a leasing season in Orange County as we have hoped, this market will still produce our second strongest results in the portfolio for 2018. And last but not least, San Diego. Our results for the quarter were in line with expectations. Occupancy was 96.4%, which is exactly what we anticipated. And achieved renewal increases for the quarter were 6.3%, which was slightly better than our expectations. Today, our San Diego occupancy is 96.7%, which is 60 basis points lower than the same week last year. However, it\u2019s still in line with our guidance expectations. Our base rents are up 1.6% as compared to the same week last year. And we expect achieved renewable increases for July and August at 6.3%. There is no change to our full-year revenue growth expectation of 4% for San Diego. In closing, we are more than halfway through our peak leasing season, and we continue to see strong demand for our products. New supply is being absorbed at a rate greater than we expected and pricing of those units remains rational. New York and San Francisco drove the majority of our 50 basis-point positive guidance provision. Seattle and Orange County, two of our smaller markets, continue to be a bit behind our original midpoint expectations. And Boston is ahead of our expectations. And the rest of our market DC, LA, San Diego are basically on track and performing slightly better within 10 basis points to 20 basis points of our original expectations. A sincere thank you to the entire Equity team. Peak leasing season is exhilarating and exhausting at the same time. Your efforts and results year-to-date are beyond appreciated. Your relentless focus on delivering remarkable experiences to our residents is clearly paying off. Keep it up. Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you, Michael, and good morning. Michael has just discussed our markets and the upward revision to our same-store revenue guidance, and I want to take a couple of minutes here to talk about our revisions to our same-store expense guidance and to our full-year normalized FFO guidance. First, for same-store expenses, we have lowered the midpoint of our full-year same-store expense guidance to 3.75% from 4%. This is primarily driven by our expectation of modestly lower property tax expense growth and for lower on-site payroll expense growth. As a reminder, these two expense line items together constitute approximately 65% of our same-store operating expenses. Year-to-date, we have produced expense growth of 3.5%. We don\u2019t expect a big change in the growth rate of our expenses in the second half of the year. Now, I\u2019ll give you a bit more color. You saw us produce 4.5% growth in property taxes through the first six months of 2018. We now expect our full-year property tax expenses to grow in the range of 4% to 4.5%, and that\u2019s down from the 4.75% to 5.75% prior range. This is due to both significantly better than expected appeal activity, as well as our expectation of a reduction in the growth rate of our taxes upon the sale of a same-store asset that David Neithercut will discuss in a moment. Also, we have lowered our expectation for on-site payroll expense growth to a range of 3% to 4%, and that\u2019s down from 5% before. At the beginning of the year, our budget assumed continued pressure on on-site payroll, especially compensation for our maintenance personnel. While we are still feeling wage pressure, especially on the maintenance side, our on-site payroll expense growth has been positively impacted year-to-date by a reduction in our estimate of medical reserve expenses. Year-to-date growth of 2% in on-site payroll means that payroll expense growth will be higher in the back half of the year than it has been year-to-date but that is mostly due to a harder 2017 comparable period in the second half of the year than any real change in trend. Now, moving over to normalized FFO. In our earnings release, we raised the midpoint of our full-year same-store revenue guidance to 2.1% from 1.6%, driven by the strong renewals, low turnover and high occupancy in our portfolio that Michael just discussed. I just went over our expectation of a decrease in same-store expenses which collectively allow us to raise the midpoint of our same-store NOI guidance to 1.4% from 0.75%. On the normalized FFO side, we are picking up about $0.03 per share from higher same-store NOI and another penny or so from our 2018 transaction activity due to our narrowing of our reinvestment spread and the timing of our acquisition and disposition activity. These positives are partially offset by a one penny per share increase in interest expense, primarily due to the increase and timing of the same transaction activity and its impact on our intra-period borrowing. The result is a modest increase to our normalized FFO guidance from $3.22 per share to $3.25 per share. All-in-all, revenues improved, expense is slightly lower, normalized FFO slightly improved. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to David. David Neithercut : Thanks, Mark. On the transaction front, second quarter was pretty quiet with only one acquisition occurring and no dispositions. That acquisition being a 240-unit mid-rise property built in 1999 located in Hoboken, New Jersey. Now, as noted in last night\u2019s press release, through the first half of the year, we have acquired two assets for $200 million and sold four assets for $290 million at an accretive spread of 10 basis points. Also noted in the press release is a revised assumption for the year of $700 million of acquisitions and an equal amount of dispositions, which obviously will require a fair amount of activity in the second half of the year. Included in that activity are several acquisitions under contract and in the due diligence process totaling nearly $500 million, which includes a couple of recently built properties in close-in, highly walkable neighborhoods of Denver. As we said repeatedly, our exit there was not market-related but rather portfolio-related. We\u2019ve continued to carefully watch Denver, because it possess many of the characteristics we look for in one of our markets that being a highly educated workforce, strong growth and high paying jobs and relatively high cost to single family housing as a multiple of income. And we think that with the new supply that has recently been and will soon be brought on line in Denver, there will be additional attractive opportunities to acquire assets that meet our investment criteria, as we rebuild a critical mass in the market. Our second half transaction activity will also include the disposition of an asset on Manhattan\u2019s West Side that is currently under contract at a price in excess of $400 million, and at a very attractive disposition unit. This sale is expected to close late this quarter with all contingencies currently waived and subject at this time to only normal closing conditions. This disposition will be discussed in more detail following closing, but it does represent an opportunity for us to reduce our exposure to the West Side where we have a significant portfolio of assets, as well as an opportunity to address the negative impact on our New York City growth rates by reducing our exposure to properties with expiring 421-a real estate tax benefits. In fact, going back to Mark\u2019s comments just a moment ago, on the expected improvement in our 2018 same-store operating expenses, this sale will reduce our portfolio-wide growth and same-store real estate taxes by 30 basis points. Turning to development. During the quarter, we started work on our tower in Boston to West End neighborhood that we discussed on our most recent call. This is a 469-unit project that will be delivered in 2021 at a cost of $410 million. We were also very pleased to note in last night\u2019s release that we now expect to stabilize three development deals on the West Coast two to three quarters sooner than expected. More clear example is the continued strong demand for high-quality, multifamily properties across our markets. So, I\u2019d like to close with just a few comments on Proposition 10 that\u2019s being the California ballot initiative to overturn Costa-Hawkins. For those of you unaware of the situation, municipalities in California have for many years been able to implement rent control. However, it would be subject to certain limitations, as a result of the Costa-Hawkins Law. One, it can only be imposed on properties built before 1995; and two, properties are subject to rent control must be allowed to move their rents to market upon vacancy, which is known as vacancy decontrol. Preposition 10, which will be on the ballot in California this November, seeks to repeal Costa-Hawkins, which would remove these limitations on rent control for those jurisdictions opting to implement rent control, which of course not all actually do. Now, our EQR has joined the California Apartment Association, public and private landlords across the state, numerous trade organizations, affordable housing groups, state and local chambers of commerce, veterans and minority groups, nationally recognized independent research organizations, among many others to create a coalition to defeat this proposal. This will not be an easy fight because on the surface who isn\u2019t supportive of affordable housing. However, when made aware of the negative impact the rent control has on the existing housing stock and of the disincentive it creates to build more housing, which is truly the only way to address the shortage of housing, many people come to understand how bad rent control can be for the neighbors, neighborhoods and communities. So, we will fight Proposition 10 at a cost to EQR of $1.6 million to-date. And regardless of the outcome, we will continue to fight attempts at the local level to enact rent control. Because this is bad housing policy, plain and simple. There is a reason that it has made no headway in the legislature and why the current Governor and both gubernatorial candidates have come out against it. And that is because it is widely understood that rent control creates a disincentive to invest in the existing rental housing stock and a disincentive to build more rental housing and is therefore the worst possible action that could be taken to address the shortage of affordable housing, because rather than address the problems, it exacerbates it. The answer is to build more housing. And there is not one solution that will work everywhere there is a housing shortage. But, the basket of solutions includes inclusionary zoning, looking hard at some of the regulatory requirements can add significant costs to new development projects, increasing federal low income housing tax credit program, and addressing the nimbyism that exists in many of the areas where the current housing shortage is the most acute. Now, there is no question that we have a serious housing issue across our nation which needs to be addressed. And while the answer may not be easy, solutions do exist. And it has been proven time and time again that rent control is not one of them. So, Kathy, we will be happy to open the call now to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Juan Sanabria : Hi. Good morning. I was just hoping for the latest portfolio-wide color on 2019 supply and the expected delta versus \u201818. And if you could maybe just highlight which markets are seeing the biggest deceleration, if any and are you seeing an unexpected increase? Michael Manelis : Yes, sure. This is Michael. So, I guess, I would say, at the highest level, we have rolled up about 71,000 units for 2018, going down to 57,000 units in 2019. And when you go across the markets, the market that probably has the most pronounced reduction is New York, dropping from 19,400 units down to 8,500 units. The rest of them are moving, I mean slightly, but it\u2019s not as material of a decline as what we see in New York. Juan Sanabria : And with the latest cut of the numbers, has there been any material move from \u201818 into \u201819 outside of the LA market which you highlighted in your prepared remarks? Michael Manelis : No, no material change moving between here outside of what we saw on our LA. Juan Sanabria : And thank you for the color on the renewals by market. Would you mind providing the new lease spreads by market, as well as the portfolio-wide spot occupancy? Michael Manelis : Yes. So, I want to just say on the new lease and I kind of -- I think I said this on the last call, so I think it\u2019s important that I reiterate. We don\u2019t believe that looking at these results for any single one quarter is the best way to think about this metric at a market level. I\u2019m just going to tell you that we just went through the process of updating all of our full-year expectations when we went through the guidance revision process. And on our full-year basis, our assumption changes were as follows. So, New York was in increased by a 100 basis points in our expectations for new lease change, San Francisco was increased by 50 basis points, and Seattle and Orange County were both reduced by a 100 basis points. The rest of our markets were either on track or had marginal moves in either directions. Juan Sanabria : Okay. But, can you provide the second quarter figures for the new leases? Michael Manelis : Yes, sure. So, Boston was positive 30 basis points; New York was negative 1.2% or 120 basis points; Washington DC was negative 0.9%; San Francisco was up 5.1%; Seattle was up 0.7%; LA was up 2.6%; Orange County up 0.4%; San Diego up 3.7%, putting the entire portfolio up 1.4% as we disclosed in the release. Operator : We\u2019ll now hear from Nick Joseph with Citi. Nick Joseph : On reentering to Denver, how many assets or what percentage of NOI do you need to own to reach an acceptable scale? Michael Manelis : That\u2019s a good question, Nick. As we look at, we think that we can get an appropriate sort of critical mass with, call it 14, 15, 16 assets. That\u2019s probably around a 1.5 billion or about 5% of our sort of NAV allocation, if you will. And these two assets we\u2019re underwriting, get us 20% of the way there. Nick Joseph : Okay. So, do you expect to reach that level over the next two to three years or is it more of a next cycle target? Michael Manelis : I think, it\u2019s hard to say. A lot of it will just be -- we can find opportunities to trade out of other markets, sort of what we are doing here and trading out in New York, and reallocating that capital in Denver. If there are opportunities that might be faster, but I think it would be hard pressed to sort of put a specific timeline on it, but one that we will be -- really have our eye on and try and get there as soon as appropriately possible and what we think about allocating capital. Nick Joseph : And then, you\u2019ve done a great job with renewals and drive internal but lower. Is there an opportunity to drive it further, or do you think you are close to frictional turnover level? Michael Manelis : I guess, I would just say tell you, I think our expectation is that we\u2019re going to continue to see the results that we\u2019ve seen play out for the first half for the balance of the year. I mean, the teams are focused on this. How much more improvement are we going to see than these 100 basis points declines that were post in each quarter, I don\u2019t know. I mean, I think we\u2019re probably getting down towards where we will post kind of the lowest turnover, but we will see kind of where we go from there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : David, I just wanted to make sure I head you correctly. I think, in your opening comments, you said you were maybe trending towards the high end of the expectations. I just wanted to make sure, given that you\u2019ve done 2.2 revenue growth in the first half, the 1.9 at the low end would kind of imply a 1.6 second half. So, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re not assuming there\u2019s a big deceleration. I mean, is it fair to assume you\u2019re kind of in that 2.1 to 2.3 range right now? Michael Manelis : So, Steve, this is Michael. I guess, I would say, yes. So, we have a lot of confidence in the 2.1% midpoint that we just put out there. I do want to say that it doesn\u2019t take much to move our revenue by 10 basis points in the portfolio, winds up coming down to $2.4 million. And the 40 basis points range that we just communicated in the release is really just the result of a sensitivity analysis that we complete for each market that kind of looks at best likely and worst. And I said, right now, we\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in the 2.1. We have a pretty difficult comp period coming up in front of us from an occupancy standpoint and several of our markets have peak deliveries occurring in the third quarter. So, as far as the bottom end of that range, the 1.9, there is a couple of different ways to get there, but it basically is going to come down to our ability to hold occupancy at 96.1% for the second half of the year. And a 30 basis-point decline in occupancy in the second half, which we do not see happening at this point, but that would result in revenue towards the bottom end of our range. But on the opposite end of the spectrum, continued improvement in retention and demand, which we are seeing, will accelerate rate growth and push occupancy higher, and that in turn would result in the higher end of our revenue range. Steve Sakwa : And then, I guess, I want to just how you guys address maybe construction costs. I know, you don\u2019t have that many new projects starting other than the new one in Boston. But maybe David or somebody else could just sort of address what you\u2019re seeing in import costs and things like steel and wood, and how that\u2019s impacting maybe underwriting today for new deals? David Neithercut : Well, it\u2019s hard and hard, Steve, particularly as these construction costs go up more quickly than rental levels. We thought -- in 2017, across our markets we saw 4% to 8% increase in hard costs and we\u2019re expecting an underwriting same sort of expected growth this year, even though that we are not bidding anything ourselves. But as our guys track those costs, that\u2019s what they are seeing, again this year. And that is before any inclusion of any kind of impact of tariffs. I have had just -- my construction guys tell me, I think steel, because of the results of the tariffs are up at least 25%. And I know Mark has had some conversations with others that might -- has some color for you as well. Mark Parrell : Yes. I mean, Steve, attending some industry events and hearing a large general contractor speak to a room full of developers, so, I\u2019ll tell you, had rapt attention on this point. What they are seeing with -- and this was before the steel tariffs, but just the general threat of it, plus the lumber tariffs that already exist with Canada that all of that was pushing our cost up 4% to 8%. And indeed, it was also adding a cost to a lot of construction contracts that created real uncertainty where the general contractor and the subs weren\u2019t willing to take risk on some of these items, which really puts a lot of pressure on the developer and on their contingency. Steve Sakwa : So, I guess, it\u2019s fair to assume -- or I mean, can you point to or do you expect then that to just really lead to kind of a drop off in new supply here over the next kind of say 6 to 12 months? David Neithercut : Well, we\u2019ve certainly -- we\u2019ve said that for some time. Certainly, there is product in the pipeline that would be unaffected by this. Our deal when we started in Boston is unaffected by any of this, but that contractor sort of locked down. But certainly, we hear anecdotally all the time, Alan George, our investment guys share all the time about projects that are being pushed aside, equity capital that unwilling go forward, in deals that are looking for new capital sources specifically as a result of this. So, I see no reason why this won\u2019t have a significant impact on the number of starts going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. John Pawlowski : There has been some news articles out there about pop-up hotel at your 100K Apartments in DC. I was wondering if you could provide the economics, average rents, margin, CapEx reserve on that building now that will be a more of a short-term lodging type focus versus if there was a 100% traditional apartments. Mark Parrell : I don\u2019t have that compared to what it would be, John. But we have cut a deal with this entity called WhyHotel where they are chasing down 95 units for nine months in our property that will soon be delivered. We get a base rent from them as well as a participation over some thresholds. These are apartment experienced guys. So, they\u2019ve been very easy to work with, very compatible to work with. We think it\u2019s a great opportunity to deliver some income in vacant units that would otherwise remain vacant over that nine-month period. Michael Manelis : And John, they provide all of the goods. They are providing -- they are furnishing the units. There is no additional capital on our part. And they are providing the staffing to address any concerns that their hotel residents, so to speak, have. So, there isn\u2019t like a cost impact effectively on us. John Pawlowski : Okay. Can you share a stabilized yield projection? Mark Parrell : I beg your pardon? John Pawlowski : Could you share a stabilized NOI yield projection on the development? Mark Parrell : On that particular property, 100K? We think that deal will stabilize in the mid-5s. John Pawlowski : And then, turning back to Denver -- sorry, if I cut off you there. Michael Manelis : No. Just to be clear, the hotel part will go away. When lease is up, David\u2019s projection is strictly a residential apartment execution\u2026 David Neithercut : That\u2019s the 12 months forward return on a fully stabilized apartment product. The existence of the WhyHotel will just provide some income in advance of that calculation. John Pawlowski : Okay. Turning back to Denver, when you are underwriting that market, again, obviously, I know, it wasn\u2019t end market exit, but when you are underwriting Denver and long-term NOI growth in Denver versus your existing portfolio, how is that market ranked against your existing markets? David Neithercut : Well, we think that Denver will be not particularly strong performer in the current and in next year because of the new supply that\u2019s being delivered. We do believe supply will reduce considerably in 2019 and that it should probably -- perform most likely in the upper half of the market in which we currently operate. John Pawlowski : And one last one if I may. To get the $500 million, will -- what other markets will be source of funds to grow or $1.5 billion, I\u2019m sorry -- to get to the $1.5 billion, current environment, what other markets will be source of funds to fund Denver? David Neithercut : Well, I guess, it\u2019s possible all of them could. Again, this is just a relative trade process. I think it\u2019s possible we will continue to look at other New York assets that are subject to the 421-a tax burn off, but that\u2019s not a requirement. So, as we look at across all of our properties on a regular basis, and we have sold out of all of our markets from time to time, and it will just be depend on what we think the best opportunity is at the time. Operator : We will continue on to Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Rich Hill : One, I guess, macro question and then a little bit more micro. Talking about the New York -- the New York market for a moment. Obviously, it seems like, for lack of a better term, the worst case scenario has been taken off the table. And you are a lot more optimistic about New York City than you were previously. But, I\u2019m sort of thinking about the future, and is this less than 1% of revenue growth, sort of a new steady state, just given the supply versus demand technicals? And while it\u2019s not going to be nearly as bad as maybe some fear? Is it fair to say that we are not getting back up to the 2% plus revenue growth that we have seen in the past the like other markets? So, I guess, what I\u2019m trying to get your view on is supply versus demand technicals. And if supply ebbs over the next couple of years, are we expecting to see a reacceleration in same-store revenue or is it just more muddling along in this zero to 50 basis-point range? Michael Manelis : So, this is Michael. I guess, I\u2019m not going to speak too specifically about \u201819 or into \u201820, but I guess I\u2019d tell you, just given where we are in the trajectory that we have and the ability for this market to absorb the units that they seem to date in a rational way, I\u2019d suggest that we will start to see modest pricing power start to return. And it may be neighborhood by neighborhood, submarket by submarket, but I think we will be in a position to get back to what you just described as more normal growth, 2% and 2.5%, something like that. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s going to happen immediately in \u201819 but I think clearly you are going to see some of that momentum start to emerge. Rich Hill : And then, back to the micro question. It looks like a retail move out in LA might have been just a little bit of a topline headwind. I\u2019m sorry, if you mentioned this, but it looks like just back of the envelop that was maybe 10 basis points off the topline, or am I thinking about that correctly? Mark Parrell : Right. So, for Los Angeles, we had one -- we had two retail centers vacated, single asset was about $500,000 in straight line rent that we reversed. So, by the end of the year, it will have no effect on the entire portfolio. And I would say to you right now, it had a very minimal rounding effect on the 2.2 we reported for the entire portfolio. For LA, you saw the footnote, there was an impact and that\u2019s why we footnoted it. By the end of the year, as Michael mentioned in his script for Los Angeles, it might be a 10 basis-point negative, but not much. Operator : Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Just to follow up on that retail vacancy. Was this an unexpected vacancy? And do you see this occurring in other markets, just given the tough retail environment? Michael Manelis : Sure. Just to give context, about 2% of our total rental income is from retail. We have a very small retail portfolio. We run it mostly as an amenity for our residents in our buildings, so coffee shops and like are very common tenants. So, no, this is uncommon, it\u2019s lumpy, it\u2019s -- I wouldn\u2019t -- we don\u2019t see this as a repeating event. John Kim : Couple of questions on Denver. One, do you expect to develop in this market, or just growth of acquisitions? And two, one of the arguments about being in this market was new supply, and what makes you comfortable about overcoming this characteristic? David Neithercut : We currently will reenter that market through acquisitions. We will certainly consider some joint venture development, the opportunities that they present themselves, and that is the way we got into the development business back in 1990s. And if appropriate, we believe there is capacity to develop ourselves there, we will certainly consider that. Just with respect to the market, I\u2019ve said and we\u2019ve said for quite some time that this was not a market related exit, but it was a portfolio related exit when we sold the last time. And as -- when we did so, we saw this new supply coming and knew that it would have an impact on the marketplace. But we also thought that new supply would likely represent opportunities for us down the road, if and when we decided to reenter the market. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening right now. So, as I said previously, we\u2019re not expecting to get terribly robust revenue growth, maybe in the first or second year in Denver. But, we think we\u2019re buying it at a great assets, at a very good basis that will perform very well, as we get into 2019 and we begin -- we see that new supply begin to abate. Operator : We\u2019ll continue on to Michael Lewis with SunTrust. Michael Lewis : You guys talked a bit about the low turnover and rightly it sounds like a lot of that is due to what you guys have been able to achieve. I was just wondering, if there is anything more macro out of your control that you think is causing the wind to be at your back on the turnover. Maybe it\u2019s -- in your markets maybe SALT deduction is causing people to move out from ownership or maybe it\u2019s some other factor that\u2019s either continue to help you or turn against you on that front? Michael Manelis : I think, there is a lot of reasons why this reduction is occurring. I think, the efforts of our onsite folks is just kind of the icing on cake that\u2019s brining us down. But, you\u2019ve got momentum in people deferring life decisions, marrying later, having children later, not rushing out to buy homes. I mean, buying home is the move up has declined in every single one of our market this last quarter outside of Orange County. So, I think, there is clearly other factors that are contributing to this decline, but I think our relentless focus on renewing our residents is clearly helping this as well. Michael Lewis : Maybe a part B to that next question and the demographics are interesting. The oldest millennials are 38 this year. Have you seen anything on the margin there with movement, maybe an increased move toward homeownership? Michael Manelis : No. David Neithercut : I mean, as noted, we\u2019ve seen percentage of our move-outs to buy single family homes reduce. And we operate in the markets that have got very expensive costs of single family homeownerships such that we would expect our residents to remain renters for significantly longer, and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening. Michael Lewis : Thanks. You had that 2.2% year-over-year same-store revenue growth actually in each of the past four quarters, and the quarter before that was 2.1%, and the midpoint of the guidance this year was 2.1%. So, it\u2019s really kind of steady now in this range. And I\u2019m sure your cost, talking about 2019, but given this kind of steadiness and it looks like maybe supply is going to ease a little bit. I mean, do you think 2019, since the revenue growth is going to be higher or lower than \u201818 or do you think -- this is kind of where we are at right now as far as kind of a balanced market. Mark Parrell : We can\u2019t go into 2019 revenue growth at this time. We\u2019ve sort of given you all the facts we see them. And at least for this juncture, you\u2019ll have to come up with your own conclusion to that. Operator : Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Rich Anderson : So, the way you are approaching Denver, which is to buy now, even though the market isn\u2019t great is interesting. And I\u2019m wondering if that can be extrapolated to the New York City metro area, despite the fact that you got a $400 million asset for sale. Do you think there\u2019s any opportunity to buy at this point where it isn\u2019t great, but maybe will get great eventually again? David Neithercut : Well, I think that you are generally on to the thought process there, Rich, and that is, this is a trade. Right? We are trading capital from one market into another market. And as we look at what\u2019s happening in New York and the low growth we\u2019ve had there and the expectation for lower growth as -- in some of these assets as a result of the 421-a tax burn-off, it may make sense to rotate some capital into some other markets. Now, I do want to note that the asset we acquired this past quarter, it happened to be in the New York metropolitan area. So, it\u2019s not as though that we are selling or exiting New York. We were just rotating some capital out of some New York assets into another New York based asset as well as into Denver at this time. Rich Anderson : And then, if I could just ask the other recent question little bit differently. I\u2019m not going to look for 2019 guidance, I know you are not going to give me that. But maybe you can give 2021 guidance. And the way I\u2019m thinking about it is, do you feel like this is a tight turning kind of situation with regard to your new guidance? I can appreciate, it\u2019s going better for you in this current year. But having experienced cycles in multifamily for many, many years, not to dig you, I\u2019m curious where do you think we stand right now in terms of how it\u2019s playing out versus history? In other words, revenue of 2.2 last year, maybe you are getting close to that this year. Are we at the bottom or at least nearing the bottom from your perspective, particularly when you consider the decline in deliveries that you\u2019re seeing in your markets? David Neithercut : Well, there is all sorts of things that will influence performance in 2020 and 2021. But, I think that you did touch on some important issues there. Michael just talked about what improved pricing power expected in New York soon as a result of this reduction in the new supply. There is a significant fall off of new supply coming in, in 2019. And as discussed earlier, to one of the questions, we are expecting supply to remain sort of in check, if you will, among other reasons, for the increase of construction costs and now the tariffs, and to Mark\u2019s comments, the uncertainty of costs as a result of the tariffs. So, we look at supply being reasonably in check, beginning 2019. In general, there are some markets where like DC we are expecting it about the same on a year-over-year basis but just across the portfolio. So, absent any other sort of external sort of geopolitical sort of shocks or economic sort of shocks, we certainly expect with the current demand we are seeing and the retention that we are seeing and the expectation that our residents will be unable to afford single family housing or will opt to remain in rental housing for whatever reason, we think that the supply-demand fundamentals and the dynamics will improve from here. Operator : We\u2019ll go to Drew Babin with Baird. Drew Babin : A question, kind of taking supply out of the picture, lots of questions on supply. I guess, which markets would you see that on a seasonally adjusted basis you are seeing the strongest pick-ups in demand, both from an employment growth standpoint and a wage growth standpoint, which market do you feel are the most exciting and I guess which markets are kind of the most sluggish at this stage of the year? David Neithercut : Well, I mean, San Francisco clearly kind of tops the list right now, with the most momentum -- I don\u2019t know how you can look at this stuff without thinking about the supply and the ability of the market to absorb the supply that\u2019s coming to the market. But that market I think we\u2019ve said now for a while, has been having these indicators of showing strength. And I gave you kind of great two great examples, not only for our own portfolio, the Peninsula from our own lease-up of that market just to kind of put that into context. From a sluggish standpoint, it has to be the two markets that aren\u2019t kind of meeting the expectations that we laid out originally, which would be the Seattle and Orange County. And I think both of those to me are short-term because of the impact to supply, they still have diverse job occurring. And I think we just need to see. We just haven\u2019t found equilibrium in those markets, which is the ability to consecutively raise rate and keep velocity at a place we need, which tells me that we\u2019ve got to work our way through the supply for those two markets. Drew Babin : I guess, said differently, are there any markets where you are seeing employment growth or wage growth reaccelerate or accelerate in a way that\u2019s been surprising? It sounds like that has occurred in the Bay Area but in other markets. Michael Manelis : No, I don\u2019t think so. I mean, I think they are kind of all within check of what the original expectations were from job growth and where the job growth is coming from. Drew Babin : And then, on kind of segmenting the New York performance from a Manhattan but the New Jersey, Hudson waterfront properties. Can you talk a little bit about that area? I know there has been a little bit of supply there, and just talk about whether you are seeing concessions and any glimpse of pricing power in the near term there? David Neithercut : So, no concession. I mean, if there is concessions because they are nominal, they are targeted, they are strategic from a marketing standpoint. I mean just to put into perspective the kind of that Hudson waterfront area, it\u2019s doing the best out of all of the submarkets that we have in New York on a year-to-date basis, posting kind of 1.3% revenue growth. So, I guess, at this point, I would say the trajectory looks good. I mean, I think, come Q4, like I said, in the slower periods, we will see what we need to do from a concessionary environment. But, the absorption of the supply there and our ability to kind of raise rates and maintain occupancy has been strong. Drew Babin : And one more for me. I was hoping if you could talk about the stabilized yield expectations on West End tower in Boston. And I guess kind of classify that as a spread through some of the acquisitions that you\u2019ve made and are going to make in the duration of this year. I guess, most specifically kind of newer properties, obviously Denver is a much different market than Boston, but some of the recent developments you\u2019ve been acquiring. I guess, what is that spread, and do you feel that that\u2019s enough spread to compensate your further development risk in the Boston case? Michael Manelis : Well, we think that our yield on that Boston deal at current rents will be in the low to mid-5s and will likely stabilize somewhere with the six-handle. We think that\u2019s a terrific yield in a marketplace where that asset would probably trade today, maybe with a high-3 cap rate. So, we think we\u2019re getting appropriately compensated for the 10 years worth of blood, sweat and tears that\u2019s gone into to try and get that deal. Plus, it\u2019s Mark, we think Boston is a great long-term market. There is a lot of exciting things going on in Boston and in Cambridge. And this will be a perfect asset for us own and operate for a long time. Operator : John Guinee with Stifel has our next question. John Guinee : Focusing on page 20 and building off the last question. It looks like you\u2019re all-in development is about 874,000 a unit for West End tower, but you have only spent about 63,000 a unit so far. Does that imply that the land cost was less than 63,00 a unit? And if so, what your hard cost and soft cost per unit get up to a total development of 874,000 per unit? Mark Parrell : I don\u2019t have that level of specificity here. We had a land base -- essentially we\u2019ve own that -- the property on which that tower is being built for 20 years or so. We had a land basis of about $20 million in that property. So, that represents a lot of what we\u2019ve done. We\u2019re incurring some demolition cost today of the existing garage, and that\u2019s all that\u2019s really been in there today, that land basis and some demolition costs as well as the capitalized costs that we\u2019ve incurred in terms of architectural and engineering and all those sort of things. So, there is not a great deal of hard cost in there yet and I don\u2019t have the breakdown at finger tips of that transaction. John Guinee : Okay. Looking at your completed but not stabilized 724 million, it looks like your second quarter \u201818 number is about an annualized 3.5 yield on cost. What do you think these three completed, not stabilized assets will stabilize at 855 Brannan and the two Seattle deals? You are about 3.5 now at 90% occupied on average. Mark Parrell : 855 Brannan, we expect to stabilize at a high 4, the Helios deal at a about 5, and the Cascade deal at about 6.3, those are the three deals. And the Cascade deal went about 6.3. John Guinee : That\u2019s a long way\u2026 Mark Parrell : But when you use the numbers in the release, that\u2019s wherever these properties were at that particular moment. So, this is going back in time and looking at these numbers. So, having $6 million as this thing is ramping up, that\u2019s not the right way to do, that\u2019s not the correct math. That\u2019s not going to get to a number that\u2019s going to make any sense. John Guinee : But the 3.5 second quarter number can ramp up into the mid-5s on stabilized? Mark Parrell : Well, I guess by definition. Right? But whatever yields we are receiving today, will grow to the yields that I just told you on those transactions, as we lease and occupy those properties and get them stabilized. John Guinee : And then, the last question on the -- I guess using maybe your Manhattan west asset as an example. What\u2019s the yield impact on the 421-a tax burn-off? For example, let\u2019s say your trailing cap rate is X and the buyers stabilized cap rate post 421 burn-off is Y, how much yield erosion is there as those tax abatements burn off. Mark Parrell : Well, it also depends on what one is underwriting on the top line as well. But bottom line growth will be negatively impacted as those roll off. And depending on what property is that roll off and between two and three to five or six years from now. The cap rate on -- the valuation on those buildings will not change as that occurs because the cap rate will reduce as the income is negatively impacted by that, and those deals will ultimately trade on a fully tax basis in the -- somewhere in the 3s most likely. John Guinee : So, if you hold to your tax -- if you hold your top line constant, what\u2019s the yield erosion over the burn off period, or is that impossible number to give us? Mark Parrell : It\u2019s an asset by asset determination. We have assets that are subject to 421-a that haven\u2019t yet begun the burn-off period. We have assets that are done and we have assets that are in the middle and some assets are in different schedules than others. So, really, it\u2019s kind of a custom calculation, asset by asset. Operator : Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill, please go ahead. Alexander Goldfarb : Just three really quick ones, so I\u2019ll just go quick. First on Denver, David. Are you guys sort of just thinking like Cherry Creek area or how broadly are you defining your target, Denver MSA portfolio? David Neithercut : Well, the two assets we have under contract now are both in the sort of uptown, downtown area, if you will, not in Cherry Creek. So, we will continue to look for downtown, highly walkable sort of locations. We would certainly consider Cherry Creek but the two assets that we\u2019ve have in our contract today are not in Cherry Creek. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. But, are you looking broader in the greater MSA, or you really want to be more Denver proper? David Neithercut : Well, again, we\u2019re looking for higher density, walkable sort of properties. So, I guess, I\u2019d -- by that it seems that we would not be in distant suburbs but we will look at properties that have got a transportation components, or certainly walkability to -- probably that have got high walk scores. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then, on the acquisition disposition guidance, both have increased the spread between acquisitions, and disposition has decreased, has narrowed. How has that impacted your IRRs that you are looking for both on what you are selling and what you are buying? David Neithercut : Well, those spreads don\u2019t impact IRRs. So, I\u2019m not sure I understand the question. That\u2019s just the first year yield comparison between what we\u2019re buying and what we\u2019re selling. So, the IRRs on what we\u2019re selling have been very good, plus 10% generally. And what we think we are buying in today\u2019s marketplace, we think we\u2019re buying probably in the 7s by and large. Alexander Goldfarb : So, I guess if I could rephrase it. As far as the impact to EQR\u2019s earnings, if that spread is narrowing, do you view that that is decreasing the growth benefit of what you are buying versus what you are selling, or you are viewing that there is no difference to the growth profile of the assets that you are trading to EQR, based on that spread narrow? David Neithercut : Again, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not picking up the question. I mean, certainly, it is in our benefit to have that spread be as narrow as possible or positive, right, to be selling lower yields and buying higher yields, provided you believe you\u2019re -- we are strategically investing capital long-term strategically appropriately. So, it\u2019s not as we are going to be selling New York and reinvesting in light spread assets. But if we can invest in our core markets and kind of assets we want to own long-term, the benefit of the Company and the business for that spread to be as narrow as possible if not positive, which will be highly unlikely that it would be positive. Alexander Goldfarb : And then, just finally, appreciate your comments on the Costa-Hawkins. From your people on the ground and everyone that you speak with, is there a sense that the local communities understand how vacancy decontrol impacts the market or is there a view that people just aren\u2019t really aware of that, and what damage that could cause if that is removed? David Neithercut : Look, I think people\u2019s feelings about this, Alex, are all over the board. There are some groups who will not listen to that side of the story. You just believe that it\u2019s incredibly important to make rents affordable to the populace today and are unwilling or unable to sort of understand what the long-term impact in the housing market of that will be. Our belief is that while -- when people are initially asked about rent control and affordable housing, they are generally in favor of such. But when one describes what the long-term impact is on the existing housing stock and the negative impact on valuations of the housing stock and of single-family housing, at all, they will generally realize that perhaps it\u2019s not the right thing to do. But, people have opinions all over the board on the matter. Operator : Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Tayo Okusanya : When we first had the change, the tax reform issue, there was all this concern about big disadvantage for states that have high bid on local taxes. I was just kind of curious, now that it\u2019s kind of been around for a couple of months, are you seeing that impacting demand for your assets or is that kind of just nothing -- you just have the zero impact or zero effect on demand in many of your key markets? David Neithercut : I think, in the short-term, any impact we\u2019ve seen has been very positive, based upon the business communities, very positive reaction to the tax law change. And with capital expenditures, we now see them taking place in the hiring and the increase in wages as a result. So, very short-term impact has generally been very positive. Tayo Okusanya : Any concern about any longer term negative impact though, or no? David Neithercut : Well, I think there are a lot of questions about the impact on some of these communities as a result of the limitations on SALT, on the state and local tax expenses and therefore the increased tax burden on people in some of these higher tax states. But as we have discussed I think on the last call, these continue to be extremely important economic centers of our country, and all continue to be -- seem to prospering extremely well as a result of lots of different things, including the new tax bill. And we will sort of see what happens. But right now I mean New York and California are two very high state -- tax burdened states, things seem to be going pretty well. Operator : We\u2019ll go to Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay : I just want to go back to the Prop 10. Do you think that this will have any impact on development starts over the near-term? And then, conversely, a bigger picture outlook on supply. Could we get a contraction a few years out, as maybe some owners go to a condo, convert their apartments to a condo, and have Equity Residential contemplated doing such action. David Neithercut : Well, we\u2019ve kind of not contemplated any specific reaction to this just yet. So, we\u2019re -- I think there is -- one of the concerns that many have about rent control is the fact that it could take existing housing stock and turn it into for sale stock and remove it from the rental stock, which would obviously be a negative. With respect to new construction, I think that\u2019s mostly impacted today by costs. It seems to me that whatever happens with rent control, there will be some limitation as to on what year product is built. So, the product likely built today, would not be negatively impacted by any changes in rent control as a result of the repeal of Costa-Hawkins. But all that remains to be seen. Wes Golladay : Okay. And then, going with the costs, can you remind us what the allocation of steel is to the overall construction cost of call it maybe a high-rise in a major city? David Neithercut : Yes. On our property in Boston where my development guys are suggesting that the cost of steel would be about 25% greater today than what was priced when we did our deal, represents about 1% of the total cost of the project. Operator : And with no additional questions, I will turn the... David Neithercut : I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s a 4% cost, which is an effect of 1% on total cost. So, it\u2019s 44 -- steel is about -- is 4% of the total cost. Okay. So, with that, thank you, Catherine. This Equity Residential, we\u2019re really -- we\u2019re pleased to celebrate our 25th anniversary as a public company on August the 12th. Who knew back in the summer of 1993 what our 22,000-unit apartment company with an enterprise value of $800 million would become. We are extremely grateful for this support of so many in investment community over that time for the dedication of our Board of Trustees, both past and present, and for the many thousands of hardworking professionals that have built this company its very special and enduring culture. So, many thanks to you all, best wishes to you all for an enjoyable summer, and we\u2019ll see you in September. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, again, that does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you all again for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

David Neithercut : Thank you, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for today's call. As we reported in last night\u2019s earnings release with the primary leasing season in the rear view mirror, we\u2019re pleased to now expect to deliver same store revenue growth for the full year of 2.3%, which is at the very top of the guidance range we provided on most recent earnings call in late July. Achieving this level of growth is the result of a couple of primary drivers, the continued strong demand across the board for rental housing and the relentless attention to customers' service delivery each and every day by our outstanding property management teams. These two factors combined to maintain very high levels of occupancy, record setting resident retention and very strong renewal rates, all despite elevated levels of new supply across our markets. We could not be more proud of our teams across the country for the outstanding jobs they do, making living with equity a remarkable experience with each and every one of our residents. I'll now ask our Chief Operating Officer, Michael Manelis, to go into greater detail on what we are seeing across our markets today. Michael Manelis : Okay. Thank you, David. So let me being with a huge shout out to our onsite teams. The third quarter represents our busiest activity period with just over one third of the entire year's renewal and new leases taking place. The team's performance and relentless focus on delivering remarkable experiences to our residents delivered outstanding results for the quarter. With just over 24,000 transactions completed during the third quarter, we achieved a 5.1% increase on renewals, and a 1.2% increase on new leases signed. This, along with maintaining our occupancy at 96.2%, has delivered third quarter revenue growth of 2.3%, which as David said, now gives us the confidence that our full-year 2018 revenue growth will be 2.3%, which is the top of our previous reported range. I would also like to highlight that the 16.4% turnover for the quarter is the lowest third quarter turnover reported in the history of our company. We renewed just over 500 more residents in the third quarter of '18 versus the third quarter of '17 with roughly the same number of explorations in each period. During the third quarter, we also achieved our highest recorded resident satisfaction scores. Service related surveys completed in the third quarter, came in with an average rating of 4.8 out of 5, and year-to-date, we have increased our all-time high online reputation scores with both Google and Yahoo. Both of these are by far the most important customer review platforms to our prospects. Bottom line is that service and leasing teams have been focused on delivering remarkable experiences and their efforts are paying off. Before I move to specific market commentary, I would like to start by saying that the overall trends we discussed last quarter has continued. Our average resident tenure, currently at 2.2 years, continues to grow, as a result of our exceptional renewal process rate service and the macro trends of millennial differing life change events like marriage, children, and buying homes. For on-demand fueled by good job growth and record low levels of unemployment in our market has aided in the absorption of the elevated supply. So let's start with Boston. Full-year revenue growth expectations of 2.4% is slightly above the expectations we shared with you on our second quarter call, primarily due to strong replacement growth, which has continued into October and stronger renewal increases. This performance happened at the same time that the majority of the 2018 new supply was delivered in the urban core, and went head to head with most of our NOI. Our revised assumptions for 2018 include occupancy at 95.8%, a negative 0.8% on new lease change and achieve renewal increases of 4.9%. Deliveries will be like the urban core over the next year, which should continue to bring modest pricing power to the market. Moving to New York, our current expectation for full year revenue growth has improved to 70 basis points. This is 50 basis points higher than the expectations we shared with you on our last call. This outperformance is a large contributor to us achieving the high end of our overall company's same store revenue guidance. Our full year assumptions for New York include occupancy at 96.5%, a negative 2.2% new lease change, and achieved renewal increases of 3%. Concession used in our portfolio remains extremely targeted and is well below both last year and all expectations throughout the year. During the third quarter, we had moving concessions being issued to less than10% of our total applications in New York. This resulted in only $260,000 in concessions in the quarter as compared to 830,000 in the third quarter of 2017. 2019 deliveries will be significantly lower than '18 with more than a 50% decline expected. The deliveries will continue to be concentrated in Long Island City and Brooklyn where to date we have not seen a significant impact to our operations. In fact, our base rents in New York today remains strong and sitting here in the last week of October they have not yet started their normal seasonal decline. As we think about DC, there is not much news to report. Positive economic conditions continued to aid the absorption of new supply, but the overall market continues to demonstrate very little pricing power. We have no change to our full-year expectations of 1.2% revenue growth. Our assumptions include full year occupancy at 96.2%, our new lease change of negative 2.1, and an achieved renewal increase of 4.2%. 2019 will mark another year of elevated supply with just over 12,000 units expected. Moving over to the West Coast, Seattle is expected to deliver 3% revenue growth for the full year, which is in line with the guidance we issued in July. Our full year assumptions for Seattle include occupancy at 95.7, a negative 1.8 new lease change, and achieved renewal increases of 5.7%. Seattle supply is expected to slightly increase next year to just over 8,000 units. As a CBD where we have approximately 40% of our NOI should experience some relief in 2019 as the concentration of the supply shift to the Bellevue Redmond submarket, where we have 24% of our NOI. On the previous calls, I mentioned the outperformance of the San Francisco market being a contributor to the upward revision of our revenue guidance. Not much has changed. We expect full year revenue growth to be 2.9%, which is consistent with our July call. Our full year assumptions for San Francisco include 96% occupancy, a positive 0.3% new lease change, and 4.9% achieved renewal increase. Looking at the overall market, the tech companies continued to grow, and the Bay Area is on track to surpass the 10 year high of 35 IPOs that was set back in 2014. There continues to be daily announcements highlighting the expansion of companies in this market. Office vacancies continued to move lower, and all of this should support positive fundamentals in our space. The deliveries for 2019 in San Francisco are expected to increase by about 2,500 units to 9,500 with over 40% concentrated in Oakland and East Bay submarkets. At this point, it is still unclear exactly what the impact from the Oakland delivery will be, sort of like the Long Island City situation on Manhattan, although this will have considerably fewer units coming online. Moving down to Los Angeles, we expect full-year revenue growth to be 3.6%, which is up 20 basis points from our July guidance. Our full-year assumptions are 96.2% occupancy, 6.1% achieved renewal increase and 1.4% new lease change. Construction in the market continues to face labor shortage issues, which has pushed 2,000 units from 2018 into 2019. We now have 2018 showing just over to 9,600 units and 14,200 units being completed in 2019. It is likely that we will see some of these expected 2019 deliveries we pushed into 2020. That being said, the combined 24,000 units over the two year period has not changed and this total has spread out over a huge geographical region. Remember, we tend to feel the impact from new supplies when it is delivered in a concentrated fashion in direct competition to our assets. For example, in 2019, our San Fernando Valley portfolio will have exposure to new supply for the first time in a while, but that new supply will have very little direct impact on our West L.A. portfolio, which is many miles away. Regardless, the overall market in L.A. continues to demonstrate strong demand, which should continue to aid the overall absorption. Moving to Orange County, our full-year revenue expectation has modestly increased 10 basis points to 3.6%. This is tied with L.A. for our second highest revenue growth market for the year. Our full-year assumptions have occupancy at 96%, achieved renewal increases of 5.5% and 0.3% new lease change. 2019 outlook for deliveries is about 500 fewer units at just over 3,500 units expected. And last but not least, San Diego. Our full-year revenue expectations remain unchanged at 8%. This will be our highest revenue growth market for the year. Our full-year assumptions have occupancy at 96.2%, achieved renewal increases of 5.9%, and 1.6% new lease space. 2019 outlook for deliveries is about 700 fewer units at just over 3,000 units expected. So now, let me close with some color on 2019. While we are not issuing guidance at this point, nor will I'd be sharing any specific numbers at the market level, I do want to share some general thoughts on our guidance process and our preliminary review of the 2019 market performance. To begin, we have two different approaches creating our guidance : one, that is bottom-up completed by the onsite and property management leaders, and the other that is a top-down approach completed by our revenue management and senior leadership teams. We are in the very early stages of both methods, and both methods consider supply, employment, and our current posture in terms of renewals, new lease rates and occupancy. Today, we anticipate that both occupancies and achieved renewal increases will be very similar or slightly better next year. We also expect to see some improvements in our new lease change as modest pricing power continues to grow in many of our markets. To bucket our very preliminary expectations today, we would say that California market, excluding any impact from propositions, and may deliver similar results in 2019. Seattle will likely to be less. And moving to the East Coast, New York, should be better, Boston's on track to be slightly better and D.C. will most likely to be about the same. With that, I will turn the call over to our President, Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Thank you, Michael. As we expected, we had a busy third quarter on the investment side. We mentioned last quarter that we planned to reenter the Denver market, after exiting that market in early 2016. We did so this quarter by acquiring two assets at a total cost of $275 million. As you may recall, we left that market because we had a portfolio that was primarily garden, surface-parked older suburban products and with a portfolio exit, not a market call. We have kept our eye on Denver and continue to believe that in the right locations and prices this market can produce excellent long-term returns. We see in Denver, many of the same attributes we see in our coastal markets and we think will lead to higher long-term returns such as single family home prices that are higher than absolute matter as well as on a relative basis as compared to incomes, the creation of many high-paying jobs over an extended timeframe, our history of strong rent growth and a market with a high quality of life where our target millennial demographic wants to live, work and play as evidenced by strong population growth in the 25 to 34 year-old age cohort. And all that comes along with a fiscally sound local and safe government. So some specifics for the assets in Denver. One asset was acquired for $140 million, which is about $395,000 a unit. The property was completed in 2017, and is a high-rise in the uptown neighborhood near downtown with a 96 walk score. We expect a 4.7% cap rate in year one and believe we purchased it at a modest discount to replacement cost. The other Denver property is a mid-rise located in the same uptown neighborhood. The property was acquired for $135 million or about $364,000 a unit, was built in 2017, and has 83 walk score, we expect a 4.6% cap rate in year one and believe we also purchased it at a modest discount to replacement cost. We also acquired a high-rise asset in Boston for $216 million or about $572,000 per unit. It's located in the south end neighborhood that was built in 2015, as 97 walk score and complements well our current Boston portfolio. We expect a 4% cap rate in year one. And while we acknowledge as a relatively low cap rate, we feel that is a good trade as it was used it was funded using proceeds from the sale of an asset on the Upper West side of New York, at a disposition yield of 3.9%. This property sold for $416 million or about $820,000 per unit. We earned a 9.8% unlevered IRR over our five year whole period. This property is in the burn-off period for the 421-a tax abatement program. A quick note on our strategy in New York. We had significant -- have a significant concentration on the Upper West side of Manhattan and felt it prudent to reduce our concentration in that submarket and our exposure to outsize real estate tax increases in the future. We continue to believe that the New York market is an excellent long-term IRR performer, as evidenced by the return on the asset we just sold. You can expect us to buy and build in New York as opportunities present themselves. As always, we will continue to review our portfolio both in New York and elsewhere with an eye to maximizing our long-term total return, including our cash flow growth. Before I conclude my remarks, as you all know, our friend and leader, David Neithercut, is retiring January 1, after remarkable 25-year career at Equity Residential. On behalf of our investors, our Board and the entire Equity nation of employees, current and past, thank you, David, for your leadership and even more for being a person of great wisdom and integrity whether it was taking advantage of capital allocation opportunities like Archdome, navigating us safely through the shoals of the credit prices, or in your work every day to improve our operations and build our team, you always made the right decision in the right way. I also thank you for all the time and effort you've spent mentoring me over the years, and I look forward to have you continue to contribute to Equity Residential as a board member. You've had a great ride at Equity, and we wish you well in the next chapter of your life. And now, I'll turn the call over to Bob Garechana, EQR's new Chief Financial Officer. Bob Garechana : Thanks, Mark, and good morning. With Michael having covered our upward revision to same-store revenue guidance, I want to take a couple of minutes to talk about same-store expense guidance, full-year normalized FFO guidance and capital markets activity. As is our custom with our third quarter reporting, we've raised our same-store guidance from -- we've provided, sorry, our same-store guidance from ranges to single points. For same-store expenses, we expect to produce full year 2018 growth of 3.7%, which is effectively at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided during the last call. Before I move to specific categories, I'd like to highlight that for the first nine months of 2018, same-store expenses increased 3.4%. As a result, our guidance implies a higher expense growth rate during the fourth quarter of 2018. This is due to a low comparable period for the same quarter last year. Now, let me provide some color on the drivers of full-year same-store expense growth. On property taxes, we've produced growth of 4.1% through the first nine months of 2018. We now expect our full-year property tax expense growth to be approximately 4% or at the low end of our prior expectations. We've continued to have success with our fuel and refund efforts this year relative to our prior estimates. As a reminder, our prior property tax expectations already contemplated the sale of the New York assets subject to 421-a in the third quarter as Mark discussed. As such, a 30 basis point reduction to property taxes was already included in our second quarter range of 4% to 4.5%. Now moving to payroll, our second largest expense category. For the full-year, we continue to expect payroll growth around 3.5%. The job market remains highly competitive with near full employment. We, like many employers, continue to experience wage pressure in order to retain our best-in-class onsite employees and continue to provide superior residential service. In our earnings release, we gave full-year same-store revenue guidance of 2.3%, driven by strong renewals, low turnover and high occupancy, as Michael discussed. With same-store expenses in line with prior expectations, we now expect to produce same-store NOI growth of 1.7%, which is at the higher end of our previous range. This contributes approximately one additional $0.01 per share to full-year normalized FFO. We've also updated our guidance for normalized interest expense and corporate overhead, which we define as property management and G&A. We now anticipate a $0.01 improvement in normalized interest expense, driven by lower than expected floating rate and later timing in our expected debt rates, the normalized corporate overhead we expect to come in at the top end of our previous range resulting in a $0.01 reduction to normalized FFO due to compensation expenses at the higher end of our earlier estimates. The net result of all of it is a $0.01 increase to our normalized FFO guidance midpoint, moving it from $3.25 per share to $3.26 per share. All-in-all, revenue expectations have improved, expenses remain in line and the midpoint of our normalized FFO guidance has modestly increased. Quickly on the capital markets front. You saw in the release that we prepaid a $500 million secured debt pool due 2019 with our line of credit. Our guidance contemplated pre-paying is relatively expensive debt and we\u2019re able to do so without penalty. We expect to turn out all our portion of this debt in the upcoming months. With the majority of the anticipated offering hedge a very favorable treasury rate, we would expect to issue at a rate well below the level of the debt that we prepaid. With that, Jonathan, I'll turn it over to the Q&A session. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Juan Sanabria : I was just hoping you guys could give us a little bit of color on New York City, and how you're seeing new lease rates trending into next year. It seems like that\u2019s a big variable. If you could just talk to the range of what's expected for New York City in particular given the meaningful drop off of it supplies, a market that is going to accelerate quickly or is that more of a 2020 story? Michael Manelis : Yes. So this is Michael. So I think, I said that I\u2019m going to stay away from kind of the specifics of ranges at a market level. I will just tell you though, in New York, that while we do see this marked reduction in the supply the 50 basis point, we like where the base rent growth is on a year-over-year basis today, holding strong into October. You\u2019re going to come up against the wave of renewals for all of the deliveries that occurred this year. So it\u2019s not that you are completely out of the wood, but you have forward momentum in New York, definitely will be better next year or should be better next year than where it is today just because of that forward momentum and what we have embedded into the rent growth. Juan Sanabria : Okay, great. And then you kind gave some parameters about supply expectations for '19. But do you have, could you provide the percent change and expect deliveries if we look at the latest action. But it seems like some of the West Coast markets are seeing an increase as a whole. But again you still generally feel confident outside of Seattle that things are going to improve. Is that correct? Michael Manelis : Yes. But I think, I said even like in the San Francisco market, we see about 2,500 more units coming consecrated in that Oakland kind of East Bay. So I think our process that we go through and obviously we start with this kind of actual database, we look at what is competitive to us. So I think in those prepared remarks as I was going through each market, I mean, the biggest market decline is New York City right. And then I would put everything else in these buckets of relatively similar and slight increase like we just said up in the Seattle and San Francisco area. Juan Sanabria : [Indiscernible] Michael Manelis : I\u2019m sorry. What was that? Juan Sanabria : Anything in the San Jose area as you mentioned Oakland that would be a concern this year relative increase for your portfolio exposure? Michael Manelis : No, I wouldn\u2019t say that there is really a concern means that, listen, there is strong demand in that market right now and even at those submarket levels. I think what we're paying out there right now is what impacts those the Oakland deliveries have on San Francisco. Will there be drawn? I think it's too early to understand that. But there is -- there all other drivers are positive for the fundamentals of our business in that market. So I think these units will be absorbed that are coming to market. And I do want to clarify one thing that because of the shifts that we what I said in the prepared remarks in L.A., we do see a significant increase in the deliveries for L.A. in '19 as compared to '18. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : Appreciate the commentary on 2019 on some of the revenue drivers there. Any early look you can give on expense growth? Is there revenues improving? Is expense growth can aid into that at all next year? Bob Garechana : Yes. Hi, Nick. It's Bob. I mean, as -- I'm going to do the same thing that kind of Michael was doing and avoid any specific commentary on numbers. But thinking about the big expense categories, you really have real-estate taxes, which we've seen a healthier run rate and not sure that you would expect anything kind of different going forward in terms of an aggregate growth component. And then, on the payroll side, we continue to be as full employment in the economy. And so we would expect to kind of see similar levels of employments or wage pressure as we look to retain and engage our employees. Nick Yulico : And then on New York City, you've had 6% expense growth this year or some of that is due to, I guess, 21 tax abatements burning-off. Can you just remind us where your portfolio in New York City is today in terms of the tax resets that have happened? What still to come? And I guess whether this issue is getting sort of better or worse in terms of expense growth for the New York City portfolio? Bob Garechana : It's Bob again. We currently have 14 properties in New York that are subject to the 421-a program. And what that means on our kind of real-estate tax run rate basis related to the abatements specifically is on a full-year basis, call it $2.5 million to $3.5 million for the next, call it 5 years. Those projects are all in different levels of abatement, and some of them don\u2019t even start until further out for the next, call it 5 years of $2.5 million to $3.5 million on an annual basis. Nick Yulico : Okay. And then, I just, last question. You sold the West End asset. It was a low cap rate. It sounds like, I mean, we heard that went to evaluate buyers. So I guess that's supported a lower cap rate. I think you have two other assets you are marketing for sale on New York right now. I mean, are those similar low cap rate deals? And is there also any tax abatement burn-off there to consider? Thanks. Mark Parrell : Hey, Nick, it's Mark. Congratulations on your new role. What I would say is -- what I'm going to comment is specific marketing activities. We're always out there putting assets on the market and then doing recycling of assets through the system. But I wouldn\u2019t expect New York to be disproportionately effectiveness as fairly by our sale activities we've done well in the market. You can see we've got a pretty good IRR in the asset we just sold. So I think, overall, as we look at New York and the tax abatement assets, if you wanted to buy relatively New York assets are built, you bought them with this abatement. Nothing really was built that didn\u2019t have this abatement on it. So the fact that we have a significant portfolio of 421-a assets is a reflection of fact that we have a significant portfolio in Manhattan. So again, I think, we've done pretty well in these assets. Michal has mentioned some improvements in the supply picture side. And I think there's some optimism in our minds about New York performance. And whatever assets we sell, we'll sell because we get a good price, and if we don\u2019t sell anything in that market that's okay as well. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Nick Joseph from Citi. Nick Joseph : You continue to drive turnover well. I know it's been a large focus. But what level of turnover do you consider frictional at which it can\u2019t go lower and then new lease growth becomes more important? Bob Garechana : Yes. I mean it's an interesting question. So I think, I don't know if were there yet. But I would say that we're getting close. I think with record turnover being recorded now for the last couple of quarters, I would expect that trend to continue. I think that the team has done a fantastic job as I said with our relentless focus on delivering outstanding service and focus on renewals. I don't know exactly where we\u2019re going to land, but I'm guessing that we're getting close to kind of normalizing on a turnover percent. Nick Joseph : Thanks. And then you did the deals in Denver this quarter. Are you considering expansion into nearby markets right now? Mark Parrell : Hey, Nick, it's Mark. The best thing I can do to guide you on that and -- we've been very open to evolution in our strategic process is to refer you to our investor materials. There is a chart on Page 17 that is like a bit of a heat map that shows you what we think on our market attributes that contribute to success long term. And Denver was the highest rated market on there that we did now. So as we think about our markets, certainly possible that we will win our other markets. But we're thinking about it in the framework of these classic characteristics that we think are good markets, which are relatively high single family costs, places where our target demographic wants to live, work and play, high wage growth markets, those sorts of things that are driving us decision. Unidentified Analyst : It's Michael filling in and speaking. David, just question for you. And congratulations on your retirement, and congratulations for the rest of the team in terms of this transition that was executed all with internal promotions demonstrating the bench and the leadership that you shown. I\u2019m just curious about staying on the Board. We've seen companies do different things where our CEO retires, and then exits completely versus that are staying on the Board. Can you talk me through how you and the board came to decision to how do you stay on versus leaving? David Neithercut : Sure. We've had lots of discussions about that, Michael. And decided that really one size does not fit all, not withstand in the fact they are probably years best practices. And probably would have been impossible for me to state on the Board if someone was coming in from the outside. But I've actually hired Mark 20 years ago. He reported nearly directly to me most of that time period. And so, I think the general belief is that -- with that scenario that it would be okay for me to remain on the Board. I think, I understand my boundaries, Mark. And I've had a lot of discussions about what role I should play sort of going forward as well as what role I can play for him sort of going forward. And I think we both go into this with our eyes wide-open and with the belief that it will work very well. Unidentified Analyst : Now would you add another independent to the Board to sort of balance things out a little bit because arguably you're technically an insider? David Neithercut : Well, I'm more than technically an insider. I am an insider. Look, we have had some Board -- quite a bit of Board refreshment over the past several years. And I expect that to continue. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Steve Sakwa with Evercore Investments. Steve Sakwa : I wondered, I know, you guys are not going to talk specifically about next year. But, obviously, Seattle is showing a very, very large deceleration on your numbers, the same-store rental rates gone from 66 a year ago down to 14. And I appreciate your comments about maybe supply moving to some of the suburban markets next year. But, I guess, how concerned you are about further slowdown in the Seattle market in general, as you look forward? David Neithercut : Yes, well, I mean, I think, clearly, and you can tell us from the prepared remarks that we expect Seattle will produce lower revenue growth next year. It almost is taking what's embedded today with the rents in place and modeling your tool work. I would tell you, I feel better right now about Seattle than I did sitting here three months ago when we were talking about the market. We kind of stabilized the occupancy albeit at a lower price point. But sitting here today, our occupancy is up at 96.1%. So we have some growth in occupancy over the prior period. And I think we're going to kind of run this portfolio with a little bit of a conservative play and build-up this occupancy and let us get through kind of some of this play. I think the job growth side; it remains a diverse market for job growth. We see that Amazon's got like -- their backup to like the record number of open positions at 7700 in Seattle. So I feel like there are some good fundamental things happening. We had a work through some of this supply. We're seeing some of that release in the CBD. Now next year there will be that shift like I said into the Bellevue, Redmond, I think, we will be able to kind of work our way through that with some of the expansion and strength for Microsoft. But, this is just something we got to kind of let play out a little bit. And I think we know how to kind of navigate our way through this. Steve Sakwa : Okay. So it sounds like things are stabilizing, obviously, we just had sort of the natural maturation of the numbers. But in your perspective, it doesn\u2019t sound like it's getting worse from here. David Neithercut : No. Other than like the erosion of the pricing power that I just alluded to it, feels like we've kind of stabilize, and we think we're in a place that we know how to navigate our way through this. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And then, just maybe switching gears to development, I'm not sure everyone to feel this. But just, in general, if you guys are evaluating new projects and thinking about potential land purchases this weight in the cycle. I'm just curious what are you seeing in terms of construction costs and sort of what is your experience in the market in terms of other developers, new projects the pace of new starts, again, we clearly continue to see a push out of the current pipeline. But I'm just sort of curious on your expectations maybe over the next 12 months in terms of new start to given sort of stabilizing market, but certainly rising construction cost. Mark Parrell : Hey, Steve, it's Mark. And David may amplify my answer a little. Just to answer the question on costs. What we are seeing is generally 4% to 8% higher cost escalation with the 4% to 6% number more of the East Coast, and the numbers in the 6 to 8 range being more Seattle, San Francisco and Southern California. We do look across our markets, and we go to events that are industry events. And here developer speak to the pressures they're under -- both under in terms of hard cost escalation, the tariffs, high land costs, the slower growth we've seen in rents of late, not keeping up with those costs as well as, of course, financing costs up. We do see construction continue to go on. We think it is abating. But not in some material sense except in New York, as Michael alluded to. But we do you think these developers are under significant pressure. We do think they're building IRRs that are, from our perspective, too low. A lot of the product that was being built is good product, and maybe this product we would be interested in buying at some point in the cycle. But at this juncture, I can't tell you, I would I see some material significant decline across the Board, again accepting in terms of New York City. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. John Pawlowski : Curious. Some of your office three tiers have been found in the table on inflection point in D.C. demand. And I know the multifamily supply is still high. Curious if you're seeing any inflection points from fiscal stimulus defense spending where big employers are starting to enter the market. Michael Manelis : Yes. So this is Michael. All that I\u2019m trying to see if I can get through the foot traffic count. I think, the overall market right now is showing increase in demand, and I see if I can write percent. So for the month of September, our foot traffic was up 1.4% over September of '17. So call it stable to increasing. What I would say is demand -- people willing to take the time to come in and take a tour with us. It's still not demonstrating the pricing power that we need. So I do think there is a stable improving demand component that's abating in the absorption of the new supply, but nothing that's really giving us the position for pricing power. John Pawlowski : Okay. And D.C. is kind of New York as a magnet for capital, and cap rates are pretty low at least for the near term growth prospects. The cap rates seeing irrationally low, perhaps. Curious, how you're thinking about D.C. as a source of funds, potentially rather expansion markets? And how you kind of rank the return prospects of D.C. versus some other East Coast markets to operate in? Mark Parrell : Hey, John, it's Mark. We\u2019re constantly looking at all the markets, including D.C. and including the low performing assets. You can expect us to continue to do that in D.C. And we\u2019re certainly aware acutely of the high supply and the impact that\u2019s had on our numbers in the last few years. I do want to point out D.C. over time has been a terrific performing apartment market. And coming out of the great recession, it was -- it did very well for us. So it does have some countercyclical benefits, it does have the factors perform well over long periods of time. So there are things about D.C. that we do find appealing certainly would be great if this supply abated a bit, but at this juncture, it is like we think the D.C. And in fact, we just completed an asset of 100K that's just started with lease up that. So far is going very well in this sort of know my area so to speak of Washington. So we like the market in many regards that we do acknowledge in difficulties as late in terms of supply. Operator : We will take our next question from Rich Hill from Morgan Stanley. Rich Hill : Good morning, guys. I'm sorry if you've mentioned this earlier, but I haven't having discussion on it. Do you have any updates on Costa-Hawkins? We're hearing various different things. But I was wondering if you have any updates from [Indiscernible] less than a month away, a couple of away at this point? David Neithercut : David Neithercut here. We really no update we would have. It would be the thing you just want hear onto on just the results of -- we see more and more newspaper editorials coming out of closing prop 10, reduced, probably, through the same totaling that you're probably seeing. So no real updates I can give you going into now just 14 or so days away from Election Day. But generally, I can tell you, we've got a -- we've assembled a really good team, very ably led by our senior most leader in the West Coast as well as Essex to the senior leader there. And those guys have really been doing a terrific job getting the message out about what a mistake this would be to address a very serious housing problem in the state. And polling is suggesting at least initially that this understanding if this is not the way that one goes about addressing a very serious housing problem. So we are going to run through the tape on this, and we feel like we've got a good message and it will be elected this year. Rich Hill : Got it. I want circle back to New York City for a second. Complete depreciation aligned New York City is really attractive asset class of the medium to long-term. But I'm curious, if you think about New York City and the supply coming down. Is it just a worst case scenario coming up the table? Or do you really expect growth to inflect? And I guess the question that I'm asking you is how do you as an owner of multifamily properties in New York City balance near-term, maybe growth that's not as attracting as some other markets, but recognizing that medium to long-term and IRR potentially still really attractive? Mark Parrell : John, it's Mark. I want to repeat that the question because you broke up a little there, you were asking for some of our view short and medium-term on New York. Is that right? Yes, I'm going to go with that because I can't quite hear at all, again, we're not in a position to give you exact numbers at this juncture. But just in 2015, this market was a 4% revenue market that wasn\u2019t that long ago. So we think there with the supply abating, the continued cycling unit of new media jobs and technology jobs into that market, as a reason this market and are now suggesting its 4% next year. But again go back to a good run rate on revenues at some point in near future. So we would like the market short-term, medium-term, long-term, all across the board. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital. John Kim : The two stabilized development you have this quarter indicate of 4.3% stabilize deals. I'm wondering if that came in below your expectations. And if so, what drove this? Mark Parrell : So I'm sorry, again, the question was relating to Helios? John Kim : Yes, Helios and [Multiple Speakers] Mark Parrell : Yes, we see those assets stabilizing at a mid-5% yield. Again, they're still occupying, positions are burning-off. All that still goes on, on those assets. So we're happy to bring those in kind of a mid-5% yield is our expectation. John Kim : Okay. And then on your partnership with WhyHotel in D.C., can you give some kind of indication to how much that could add to your development returns or your development yield on the project? Mark Parrell : So it's Mark. I mean, we think that could be $800,000 or something like that to normalized FFO. It's the really -- just to be clear, none of the numbers that we\u2019re going to show you as occupancy step in the development page of anything they do with WhyHotel occupancy temporarily if units and net properties does it hotel execution. So in the long run, you will see from us of just the 100K number strictly from a residential, permanent residential perspective. But I think you should think about it not as affecting the development yield, but really just effecting FFO next year. John Kim : Okay. Great. That was my next question. Turning to your New York strategy, do you still feel like three is a need to reduce the consternation in Upper West Side and or are you encouraged somewhat given the pricing at 101 West End? Mark Parrell : Well, we certainly thought the pricing on West End was good from our perspective. We don't feel compelled necessarily lower our exposure further there. I think, again, we will have assets in the market in all our markets to varying points in time. And but they came in we like we might take it in reinvest in Denver and elsewhere. But I don't think, we here, as a team, we don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re overexposed anymore to the Upper West Side. But again, we will look at each opportunity as they come. Operator : We will take our next question from Michael Lewis from SunTrust. Michael Lewis : You talked earlier about rising construction costs of what that maybe for supply. I wanted to ask it a little more specific to you. You haven\u2019t had to raise the budgeted costs on your active developments. Could you talk a little about when in the process you locked in cost? How much you lock in? And if you\u2019ve changed your process around that all given we're in a rising cost environment? Mark Parrell : I\u2019m going to start, and David may amplify some of this. But, for example, the West End tower deal, the so-called Garden Garage deal, we\u2019re 90% bought out on that deal. It was a matter of great interest to both the board and to the investment committee internally that we not go forward unless we\u2019re very certain about our construction cost and had an appropriate contingency. So I think we're very focused on these things. Not try at the level of detail you're asking for and each one of these deals. But as we approach both West End tower and 249 3rd Street, which are our two most recent starts, we've been very focused on making sure that as much as possible things have bought out. And if there are some risks that we got an appropriate contingency in them. So right now we feel comfortable very much with our budget. Michael Lewis : That\u2019s helpful, since West End is a biggest line and has the longest lead time. My second question is more of a bigger picture question. You know a lot has been talked about millennials finally getting to marriage age girl there right, but there get it up until their late 30s, the oldest ones. I was wondering about the following divorce rate, and if that\u2019s in any way impactful, and if you think these things together, could become a drag on household formation as that demographic wave kind of moves through the snake? David Neithercut : We don\u2019t think about -- I mean, very good question. We don\u2019t think about our assets is only attracting millennials. I mean 20% of our residents are 50 and older. We think our kind of product in the areas we are in with the urban and then suburban amenities we have attract people of all ages. So I guess, I would answer and say that, certainly through the millennials are aging. Our average aging our units is 34%. And the biggest cohort is 26, right now of millennials. So we've still got people coming feeding demand. 40 plus percent of our units are single occupant units. So again, we see continued demand across all age groups for our product that GenZ Group that's coming up. I'm not sure why they would like an urban lifestyle any less than they are slightly older siblings. So I mean, we feel pretty good about all the demographic numbers. Michael Lewis : Do you think the fallen diverse rate was paying attention to it? Or do you think it's mostly immaterial and \u2026 David Neithercut : Yes, I guess, that's kind of hard to say. I mean, I don\u2019t know if that's a trend or if that's this year's number or I don\u2019t mean. The birth rates went down and down and down and now sort of went up a little bit. I don\u2019t, I said, I'm not sure to make it something when it just happens for years. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Dennis McGill from Zelman and Associates. Dennis McGill : One question with the relation to the employment outlook, as you guys think about and plan for 2019, in general, and maybe rising uncertainty in general about the economy. How do you think about some of the key drivers whether it's employment growth, wage growth and things like that, as you build the plan? And what type of ranges would you put around that with uncertainty, maybe little bit higher deeper into the cycle etcetera? David Neithercut : Yes, great question. So just to be fair about our process, we don\u2019t have an algorithm where we can put 150,000 jobs per quarter or per month, pardon me, new jobs and come up with a revenue number. It's more that onsite teams and the end market teams talking about the hiring they are seeing and hearing about, as supplemented by what our investment teams think across our markets here in Chicago. So I don\u2019t want to get this sense, but again there is some computer that's fitting on a number for us. And again, a lot of the job growth numbers are national and our portfolio is not national, it's in certain places. So our focus is a bit more micro than maybe your question implies. Dennis McGill : Okay. And then, but just, as you think about that micro impact, I'm sure, you've looked at it that way. Is the preliminary look, and the numbers that you laid out as far as directionally markets, is that largely assuming that the employment backdrop that was in place in 2018 holds in 2019? David Neithercut : Yes, it roughly is. And we feel like we have remark -- in Michael's remarks did give you a little color on that. We see hiring occurring in all our markets whether it's a new tech company in Boston or some other hiring relating to media in Los Angeles. So we see it across the platform. But yes, we are basically, in our minds, we are now assuming the things we have rising wages across our residents base combined with employment that's roughly equivalent in '19 to '18. Dennis McGill : Okay. And then separately, can you maybe just discuss what you're hearing and seeing whether it's your own team or just out there in the market conversations around capital availability from the lending side as well as capital interest in the assets in general? David Neithercut : Well, I'm going to take part of this, and ask Bob to speak on the lending side. But it continues to be a strong bid across the board for our assets, and for our assets, we think in the apartment space in general. We do think that Chinese buyers have retrenched and are little less participatory in the market. There still are other significant foreign buyers, Canadian, Europeans, and like as well as lot of U.S. money still chasing the asset class. You kind of see that in development side, right. I mean you see the continued development flow as people trying to get exposure to our space. And again, we think flows continue to be very strong on the equity investment side. I\u2019m going to turn it to Bob to talk just about the debt availability part of your question. Bob Garechana : Yes. So breaking that up and following on Mark's comments, on the stabilized piece, we continue to see very healthy supply or multifamily kind of with the GSTs kind of lending arrangements. So overall, costs have gone up because interest rates have gone up, but that has been very healthy and no meaningful changes versus kind of prior history. On the development side, really kind of echoing Mark's comments as well. We continue to see banks lending. Construction lending is -- pricing actually has come down a little bit in terms of spread, but rates have gone up with LIBOR going up, so all-in costs are maybe a push to slightly higher. But banks are continuing to lend, and they are lending relatively conservative kind of advance rates, so loan to cost rates. What you\u2019re seeing in the space that is probably different than maybe what we thought decade ago is alternative sources of that capital in the form of private equity debt funds etcetera that are willing to be a little bit more aggressive, and we see all of those kind of sources providing capital to the space. Dennis McGill : As you look it on the development side, does that imply that developments going to last longer or prolong some of the -- what would otherwise be a decline in competition from this supply, deeper into the cycle? David Neithercut : I guess that remains to be seen, but I will say that this capital that Bob just alluded to, that\u2019s in the middle. That's above the bank and below the equity is very expensive. This tends to be very price capital. And it's going to make the pro forma even harder to pencil. But now as that money is coming in at the same cost of the banks, I mean, it's considerably higher, double the costs or more. So with that in mind, I think, it isn\u2019t necessarily going to extend things too much, just again, because the money is particularly expensive on a relative basis. Operator : We will take our next question from Drew Berman from Baird. Unknown Analyst : This is Alex to check on for Drew. Hope you guys could give us some color on the recent Boston acquisition's long-term NOI growth expectations relative to the 1101 West End asset you sold. David Neithercut : Sure, I can give you little color on that. So the asset is fully occupied. There is fair amount of competition there. So our first year number in terms of revenue growth was relatively low around 1%. And then we saw rent growth more averaging as it often does for us, in the 3s and then a few quarters here and there with expense growth for us 2.75 to 3. We generally underwrite these deals over a 10-year hold. That gives us some color there. We can certainly comment on West End, but I would say this, I don't know what the buyers pro forma looks like. I don't know what renovations they're going to do? What things they have in mind other potential uses they have? So from our perspective, we saw relatively muted near-term rent growth, relatively high real estate tax increases in the near-term. But again, at some juncture, when this burns-off, you can reset those units to market. And there is certainly value that I'm sure the buyer underwrote in the deal. Unknown Analyst : That's really helpful. Additionally, could you give us some insight on your our long-term unlevered IRR expectations for your third quarter acquisitions, most notably the Denver assets. We were just curious how you anticipate Denver's long-term NOI growth to trend whether the relative residual value argument holds up compared to the coastal markets? David Neithercut : Yes, good question. I mean, we were looking at the Denver deal is mid to high 7 IRRs unlevered over 10 years with just the way we generally measure that. They did have -- we did have in our pro forma sum increase to the cap rates on exit, but with the thought that even though these are high-rise and mid-rise construction that there would be some cap rates expansion on the end of the pro forma. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill and Partners. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you, and good morning out there. And first, congratulations David, and Mark as well. Two questions for you guys. The first is just on retention. It was a question earlier in the queue. But if you guys are raising renewals at 5%, it doesn\u2019t seem like you are holding back on the renewals and yet, again, you are still retaining more and more tenants if that retention is improving. So do you think there are other things at work like our people just less willing to move apartments the way they were a decade ago? Or have home move outs suddenly declined? Or what do you think is going on that's allowed you to push 5% overall on a sort of 1% to 2% market, and still have keep more of your tenants than lose? Michael Manelis : So, this is Michael. I would say it's probably a little bit of what everything that you just kind of alluded too. I would say from a reason for move out to buy home. We've actually seeing very little change in our portfolio. I mean year-to-date basis, we're actually down a little bit to a 11.3% of those that move out sighting that reason that was compared to 11.8 last year. Put that all in is 200 fewer people this year to date moving out with that reason. I think, in the third quarter, we renewed. I think I eluded to it 500 more residents than we did in the third quarter of last year with roughly the same amount of exploration. And I think it's a little bit of everything. I think its deferring life changes. I think, honestly we see the relationship between high customer service and retention. And we saw marked improvement in our customer service. This is something we have done and we're seeing the efforts pay off. So I think all of those things put in the blender are contributing to this retention. And to elude to the 5%, part of this too is, remember when you are pricing these renewals, so we have a lot of our transactions occurring, while, pricing these renewals three months before, and where is the rents going to be and we're issuing those renewals at that point. So I think this is demonstrating the fact that in many of our markets are rents are up 3% year-over-year, and reporting these renewals and you are negotiating through this process. And a lot has to do with where these residence prior rents were in relationship to that market as well. Alexander Goldfarb : And then the second question is just on D.C. it's been sort of a developer's paradise the past number of years. Popular speculation is that. Amazon will go to Northern Virginia. Is your view that if that happens suddenly you and other apartment landlords will benefit because certainly there will be an increase in demand Or is that fear that the developers are already waiting for this and will just ramp-up on the development side. And therefore any pick-up in jobs is going to be more than offset by development? Mark Parrell : Yes, it\u2019s Mark, Alex. I'm not sure that anything happens instantaneously. I mean, I don\u2019t think Amazon is going to open an office and immediately have 5,000 new employees, and then it get to 50,000 and whatever the number is. Again half of that obviously it's going to be more gradual. Depending where this is there is certainly the capability to developers have to build into this. But if it's near to some of our well located assets that are there already, we can certainly do this. There is no doubt. Operator : We will take our next question from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Rich Anderson : Costa Hawkins, I know where you stand on it. But have you guys done kind of a sensitivity such that let\u2019s say get\u2019s repealed and every single municipality chooses rent control and vacancy control. What the impact would be on your growth profile? Would it be 100 basis points when you look at the entirety of your portfolio? Have you done that exercise? Just to think of a worst case scenario. David Neithercut : It's David Neithercut here, Rich. We\u2019ve not done all that math, because, of course, that\u2019s the worst case scenario. We don\u2019t know what municipalities that currently have rent control demand. We don't know what municipalities don't have rent control might and act rent control was in fact a right they've had since Costa Hopkins was first put in place and even before that. And you don't know what limitations they'll put on -- they go for properties built before 1995. There are going to be properties built between 2000 and 2005, 2010. So it's just a little bit of some game theory that I\u2019m not quite sure as the productive use of our time. We do know how much NOI or current revenue we got in markets that currently have rent control. We know how much of that might be impacted if the certain market went from 1995 to 2005 or whatever. And so we -- it's just not productive use of time to do what we suggest. But we certainly do know where we have exposure [indiscernible] income might be at risk if certain changes are put in place. But as I said earlier, we feel like what a very good place with respect to the feeding Top 10, again, it's not the best thing for the state of California. It\u2019s a worst thing they could possibly do. We got a good team in place. We\u2019re running hard. We\u2019re going to right after until the bitter end and we feel good about our chances there. Rich Anderson : Okay. And then last, second and last question. You're talking a lot of that social changes, a lot of divorce, but, one thing, forgive me, but about 75% or 80% of your portfolio now has recreational use of marijuana legalized. And I'm curious how you feel about that probably going to 100% over time. Do you have the ability to write your own laws within your communities because perhaps there could be some mismatches within your community about people who are for and against it? Or maybe it is what they roll and let people do their thing, and perhaps they're happier, and everybody's happy because of that. What are your thoughts about that? David Neithercut : No client incentive there Rich. Michael Manelis : This is Michael. I would say it\u2019s not that we write our laws. I mean we have lease agreements in place. I would say almost our entire portfolio is smoke-free today. I think we have some outlier properties that we have not deployed that with. So to me the use of smoking marijuana is no different than cigarette. Cigarettes our legal today. Marijuana it could be recreational legalized in those markets. In our communities, we\u2019re still smoke-free community. Rich Anderson : Right. But they can smoke inside their apartment and run around out in the community right? Michael Manelis : No. That would be kind of a lease violation. So just like cigarette, if somebody is smoking inside their apartment, neighbors smell it and that's a lease violation. Operator : We will take our next question from Tycho Okusanya from Jefferies. Tycho Okusanya : Again, you guys have been a dynamic dual for a very long time. But again with Mark [indiscernible] to the CEO role, I'm just curious Mike, are there any changes that you can sign up with reports and maintain to the EQR's strategy now that you are kind of in the CEO seat? David Neithercut : Well, I'm not quite in the seat; I'm very close to the seat. Well, thank you for those most comments. We've never got in the dynamic dual conversations before. Look, I've been with the company almost 20 years. I've been in the CFO role for 11. The strategy, I think, say it was one that, I embrace in terms of urban then suburban products and the advantageous long-term of owning it. We have all of all the kinds here. And we certainly evolve back into Denver. So I think the strategy will naturally change overtime in response to changes and conditions, and I mean, our thought process. So I wouldn\u2019t expect it to be static. But I don\u2019t expect dramatic changes, especially on the core investment strategies. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we have no further questions. I would like to turn the floor back over to David Neithercut for closing remarks. David Neithercut : Thanks, everyone. As we are now close, what I think is my 100th and final earnings call, I want to thank everybody in the REIT community for your support, the confidence and probably most important your friendship over the last 25 years. I can tell you it's been a great pleasure and I work with all of you. For those of you, I'll see you in San Francisco in a few weeks. We look forward to thanking you in person. For those of you, I will not see, please note that I would step down at the end of the year with extra ordinary gratitude and with great confidence in Mark the leadership team here at Equity in the future of Equity Residential. So thank you very much and best regards to everybody.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to today\u2019s speaker. Please go ahead, sir. Marty McKenna : Thank you, Mary. Good morning from the Polar Vortex and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's full year 2018 results and outlook for 2019. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. And now, I'll turn the call over to Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Thank you, Marty, good morning, greetings from [Sheryl] Chicago, it\u2019s the negative 21 degrees right now, with a minus 50 degree windshield. Although the weather outside is quite cold, our business on the contrary feels quite one to us and we will spend a few moments this morning with you discussing it. And we\u2019re pleased to have delivered same store revenue growth at the top end of our original guidance range as well as solid normalized FFO growth in 2018, we had strong momentum in the fourth quarter and 2019 has started well. Now admittedly December and January are months with a seasonally well volume of transaction. So strong high wage job and income growth in our markets combined with positive demographics and a consumer preference for a Reno lifestyle in our highly desirable city has created a supported backdrop for our business in spite of elevated levels of new supply. Recent announcements regarding Amazon HQ2 and Google\u2019s continued business expansion are reinforcement of our belief that analogy economy will be focused and the markets will redo business. In Washington DC 70% of our NOI comes within 5 miles of rural location of HQ2. In New York we\u2019ve more than 20 properties that are start to new. In the Long Island city location of HQ2 we\u2019re more that are start to new from the new Google expansion location in the West Village. We expect that 2019 will be another good year for us with strong demand across our markets creating high occupancy conditions, but continuing elevated supply levels for some of our markets keeping us within the price submission allow our internal dashboards blink and green, we\u2019re also aware that the economic and other headlines are giving me more cautionary yellow signal. With that in mind, in a moment I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer to give you color and how we\u2019re looking at revenue growth across our markets in 2019 and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer will follow with a review of normalized FFO and expense results and guidance and also discuss our balance sheet and then I\u2019ll wrap it up on the prepared remarks side by speaking on our investment activity and after that we\u2019ll open the call to your questions. Go ahead, Michael. Michael Manelis : Thank you, Mark. So today I\u2019m going to begin with a quick recap of our 2018 performance. I\u2019ll share the assumptions that create the midpoint of our 2019 guidance range and I\u2019ll provide updated commentary and outlook for each market. Here are few key takeaways from 2018. First, strong demand fueled by good job growth and record low levels of unemployment in our markets aided the absorption of elevated supply. Second, equity employees delivered remarkable experiences to our residents which resulted in the highest customer satisfaction and online reputations course and the lowest resident turnover in the history of the company. We reported 51.1% turnover in 2018 which is around 200 basis points less than 2017 and if you exclude turnover for those residents who moved to a new unit in the same community, our net turnover dropped to 45%. Finally, our 2.3% same store revenue growth was achieved with 96.2% occupancy, negative 30 basis points new lease change and achieved renewal increases of 4.9% which were all stronger than 2017 results. As we sit here today we\u2019ve strong momentum coming out of the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve more pricing power today versus the same time last year which keep the dashboards blink and green and allows us to remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook for 2019, but we acknowledge that the hard work is still ahead of us in the future leasing seasons, but our teams are ready to deliver. Consistent with our preliminary assumptions that we shared on the last call, our overall guidance assumes approximately the same occupancy and renewal performance as in 2018 with a modest improvements in new lease change based on expected pricing power during the first half of the year and an embedded rent roll that is better than one year ago. Our guidance also assumes that the steady but lower job growth expectations as being predicted by many economists will lead to the continued efficient absorption of the new supply in our markets. In 2019 supply will be less in Boston, New York and Orange County and the other markets are expected to be flat or up as I\u2019ll discuss in my market commentary. Our 2019 same store revenue guidance range of 2.2% to 3.2% as a midpoint at 2.7% which is 40 basis points better than our 2018 results. The upper end of our range assumes a slight improvement in occupancy with strong pricing power on new leases staying in place through the peak leasing season. The bottom end of our revenue guidance assumes no intra period growth in rents and a modest reduction in both occupancy and renewal performance. All of our markets except for Seattle and Orange County are projected to deliver better revenue growth in 2019 as compared to 2018. So let\u2019s move onto the individual markets beginning with Boston. Boston finished the year strong with continued growth in biotech and other high wage job. Job growth accelerated in the second half of the year and fourth quarter deliveries were very light. These factors contributed to a fourth quarter performance to five seasonal trends by growing both rate and occupancy each month from that quarter. In 2018, Boston delivered full year revenue growth of 2.5% with 95.9% occupancy negative 80 basis points new lease change and a 5% achieve renewal increase. The theme for our 2019 guidance in Boston is modest pricing power. Only a small percentage of the 2019 supply will compete with our assets in Boston and Cambridge which comprises almost 70% of our revenue in the market. Most of these new supplies expected to deliver later in the year which should lead to a favorable leasing season. The 2019 revenue midpoint for Boston will be 2.8% which is primarily based on improving pricing power heading into a period with lower overall supply. Today our occupancy is 95.7% and January renewals came in at 5.8%. Our local team and portfolio are well positioned to capture the opportunity. Moving to New York which delivered 80 basis points of revenue growth in 2018 with 96.5% occupancy, negative 150 basis point new lease change and a 3.4% achieved renewal increase. These results were also accomplished with using approximately 40% fewer concessions than in 2017. New York\u2019s 2018 outperformance albeit with still the lowest same store revenue growth in our portfolio was a major contributor to us achieving the high end of our overall company same store revenue guidance for 2018. We finished the year with strong momentum in the fourth quarter. New supply in our competitive footprint will be approximately 50% lower than in 2018 with expected deliveries just under 10,000 units. The deliveries will continue to be concentrated in Long Island City and Brooklyn where to date we have not seen a significant impact to our operations. In fact, we\u2019ve been monitoring and forwarding addresses from our move outs for over a year now and we continue to see less than 2% of our residents leaving us for Long Island City. Similar occupancies, strong renewal performance and improve in a new lease change are the foundations to our 2019 revenue guidance of 1.8% for New York. We expect the market pricing to remain discipline which allows us the continued used concessions that are very strategic and targeted level and in amount that we estimated will be 25% lower than 2018. With 96.3% occupancy today, January renewals at 4.3% the local team continues to feel the strength that propelled and from the fourth quarter. So DC is the market we definitely have all been hearing a lot about in the news. Our assumptions regarding 2019 do not include the impact from any future government adjust. During the initial shutdown we do not experience anything outside of waving a few dozen late fees. If there are additional shutdowns we have a good process in place to ensure that we work with any residents who is being impacted. We finished 2018 with revenue growth of 1% in DC which was comprised of 96.3% occupancy, a negative 180 basis points on new lease change and achieved renewal increases of 4.4%. We also saw the Washington readings economy continue its strong performance in the fourth quarter ending the year with above the average job growth and an unemployment rate below the national average. Occupancy rates remain strong as class A absorption continues at a record phase. Expectations for new job growth in 2019 still indicate enough domain creation to aid in the absorption of the 13,500 deliveries expected in 2019. We\u2019re forecasting limited pricing power to continue through the year and we expect DC\u2019s 2019 revenue growth to be 1.4%, a 40 basis point improvement over 2018 is entirely due to growth that is already in place on the rent law as our full year assumptions include a slight decline in occupancy and very similar new lease change and renewal performance. Most of the decline in occupancy is expected in the back half of the year where we have a difficult comp period from 2018. Today our dashboards are growing in DC and occupancy is at 96.5% and January renewals came in at 4.5%. Moving over to the West Coast, Seattle delivered 2.8% revenue growth for the full year in 2018. This was accomplished with 95.8% occupancy, negative 220 basis points in new lease change and achieved renewal increases of 5.8%. Seattle supply is expected to increase next year to just over 9,000 units as we saw just over 10% shift in expected completions from Q4 of 2018 into Q1 of 2019. In 2019 we expect to see more impact from new deliveries in King County Suburban East Bay than the CBD area. Professional and business services and informational sectors continue to lead the way within the areas of overall job growth. Major companies continue to announce expansions and new hiring into 2019. Even Amazon is still expanding in Seattle despite their plans for New York and DC. In fact, last week they had over 9,200 open positions in Seattle which is the highest we\u2019ve seen in a while. In terms of the deliveries, only some of the 3,900 units being delivered in the Bellevue Redmond submarket will be directly competitive with our well located East Bay property. In addition Downtown Seattle should experience some relief from supply in 2019 and we\u2019ve almost 40% of our income in that submarket. In 2018 we saw growth slow significantly in this market in the back half of the year. And our 2019 guidance of 2% revenue growth reflects the impact of that second half slowdown. Overall, we expect to see a slight improvement in both new lease change and occupancy which will be offset by a lower but still healthy renewal growth rate. We\u2019re at 96.4% occupied today with January renewals at 5%. Next up is San Francisco. Our markets that in 2018 demonstrated strong job growth, 34 new IPOs and a consistent daily stream of headlines about major office leases and land acquisitions to support future expected growth from companies in the area. In 2018, San Francisco delivered full year revenue growth of 2.9% with 96% occupancy, positive 80 basis point new lease change and 5.1 achieved renewal increase. The expectation for 2019 is that San Francisco market will continue to enjoy economic and job expansion albeit at a more tempered phase. Deliveries will be higher in 2019 but the concentration shift to the East Bay Oakland Submarket. There is still uncertainty surrounding the broader impact from deliveries in Oakland. To-date there has only been a small viewer to come online and the majority of the deliveries are expected in the second and third quarter of this year. We will be monitoring the impact of this new supply in Oakland market and the overall San Francisco market. Our 2019 revenue growth guidance of 3.4% is built on very similar occupancy, new lease change and renewal growth as we achieved in 2018. Today we\u2019re 96.6% occupied with January achieved renewal increases at 4.6%. Moving down to Los Angeles, where our 2018 revenue growth was 3.6% this was achieved with 96.2% occupancy, positive 140 basis point new lease change and 6.2% achieved renewal increases. On the supply front labor shortages continue to create delays in project deliveries resulting in approximately 2,400 units from 14 projects shifting from Q4 of 2018 into early 2019 completion. This brings our 2019 delivery forecast at just over 14,000 units in LA. As I mentioned last quarter it is likely that we will see this trend continue with some of the expected 2019 deliveries being pushed into 2020. The combined total over the two year period has not materially changed and this is a huge geographical area. In 2019 there will be supply concentrations in San Fernando Valley downtown and West LA. The growth in online entertainment content is creating strong momentum in West LA and will most likely quickly absorb the new units in the submarket. We\u2019re projecting 3.8% revenue growth in 2019 for Los Angeles with slightly lower occupancy and renewals and the same new lease change as in 2018 which is being offset by gains already in place on the rent law. The reduction in occupancy is primarily in the second half of the year and is recognizing potential pressure from the new supply in a few of the core submarkets that I mentioned. Sitting here today San Fernando Valley is starting off a little weaker than expected, but the overall market in LA continues to demonstrate strong demand which should continue to aid the overall absorption. In total the market is performing very well with 96.2% occupancy and achieved renewal increases for January at 5.7%. Moving to Orange County, we finished 2018 with revenue growth at 3.5% which was comprised of 96.1% occupancy, positive 10 basis points new lease change and achieved renewal increases at 5.7%. Our revenue growth for 2019 is expected to be about 40 basis points lower at 3.1%. The decrease is primarily due to recognizing the impact of lower growth from lease assigned last year along with the slight decline in projected renewal increases. 2019 occupancy and new lease change expectations are very similar to 2018 results. Job growth appears to be slowing but the overall outlook remains positive. Overall, deliveries in Orange County will be less in 2019 with just under 3,000 units expected, but the actual impact to us from a competitive standpoint should be very similar to 2018. Today we\u2019re 96.4% occupied and have achieved a 5.6% increase on January renewals. And last but not least, San Diego. We finished 2018 with revenue growth of 3.9% which was comprised of 96.3% occupancy, a positive 160 basis point new lease change and achieved renewal increases at 6.1%. Our outlook for 2019 will be the same with revenue growth at 3.9% with similar occupancy and new lease change projection and slightly lower increases on renewals which is being offset by gains already in place on the rent law. Deliveries are projected to be slightly higher than the 4,300 units and the impact to us is expected to be very similar to 2018 with pressure on our downtown locations. As of today San Diego is 95.9% occupied and achieved renewal increases in January are 5.3%. Now we did reenter the Denver market in 2018 and added another property this month. Denver is not part of our same store pool and is not included in our guidance range. I could tell you that right now the market is performing to our expectation. The one in close with a huge shut out the employees of Equity residential. There were rent less commitment to our residents that was reflected in our all time aid customer satisfaction metric is amazing. We\u2019re so proud of their accomplishments in 2018 and we look forward to 2019 being even better. We have strong momentum and we\u2019re off to a great start. Thank you. Bob Garechana : Thanks Michael. This morning I\u2019ll take a few minutes to discuss our guidance assumptions for 2019 same store expenses and normalized FFO. I\u2019ll round out my remarks with a brief discussion of our balance sheet and capital market. Before I begin a couple of quick comments on the fourth quarter 2018. In the quarter our same store revenue grew 2.6%, expenses grew 4.2% and NOI grew 1.9% putting us generally in line with our full year operating expectations from the third quarter call. For normalized FFO we delivered $0.84 which is a penny shy of the midpoint of our expectation. As we mentioned in the release this is primarily driven by the negative impact of higher than anticipated casualty losses driven by rainstorm damage at several properties in our Washington, D.C. area portfolio. Regarding 2018 same store expenses let me give some more specific color. The relatively high year-over-year expense numbers we experienced in repairs and maintenance and insurance are driven in part by very low or negative growth for the comparable period in 2017. For example, repairs and maintenance grew 1.6% for all of 2017 and only 0.7% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Insurance expense for the same period was negative. Moving over to payroll, as is typical in the fourth quarter onsite payroll was impacted by various throughout on payroll related reserves like the medical reserve which we\u2019ve discussed in the past. Now onto 2019 guidance. For full year 2019 we expect same store expense growth between 3.5% and 4.5%. 80% of our same store expenses come from three major expense categories. So let me walk you through and we currently estimate that unfold in 2019. At a little over 40% of overall same store expenses, property taxes drive anticipated 2019 growth. We currently anticipate fewer refunds for the year relative to 2018 because of the great appealed success we had for that period. Also contributing to growth in 2019 are certain of our New York properties that are subject to the 421-a abatement program and are in various stages of burn-off that we've discussed on prior calls. As a result, we would expect 2019 real-estate tax front growth between 3.75% and 4.75%. In on-site payroll, our second largest category, we continue to experience a very competitive job environment. Many of our markets were experiencing elevated supply as Mark and Michael mentioned which is competing with us not only residence but also for highly skilled employee. That coupled with a strong general employment factor up means we continue to focus on retaining our colleagues on site. As such, our expectations on payroll for the full-year 2019 is for growth between 4% and 5%. Finally, our last major category utility. Utility should benefit in 2019 from a couple of factors that reduce our expected rate of growth relative to the 4.5% increase we posted in 2018. First, in 2018, we experience higher than usual growth in trash and store expense in Southern California that shouldn\u2019t repeat itself in 2019. Secondly, we experience some very extreme weather in the first half of 2018 in the northeast that we did not include in our 2019 forecast. We are in the business of forecasting weather but our guidance does assume a more traditional run rate. Finally, we continue to benefit from our on-road electricity and gas purchase contract along with our investment in LED lighting for generation and other initiatives to manage this extent. As a result, in 2019, we expect utility expense to grow between 1% and 3%. Our guidance range for normalized FFO in 2019 is $3.34 per share to $3.44 per share. Major drivers for this change between our 2018 normalized FFO of $3.25 per share and the midpoint at $3.39 per share which from 2019 guidance include a $0.10 contribution from same store NOI and our same store properties based on the revenue and expense assumptions that Michael and I just outlined. A $0.04 contribution from our leased up properties which anticipated to generate $40 million in NOI in 2019. A $0.01 contribution from the timing of our acquisition and disposition activity involve 2018 and 2019, offset by $0.01 in higher expected interest expense. While we continue to benefit from favorable refinancing activity, we do anticipate short-term rates on average to remain elevated in 2019 relative to 2018. This expectation is driving a negative impact. Final note on the balance sheet before turning it back to Mark. Our financial position remains the strongest in the company's history and one of the strongest in the REIT industry. During 2018, we not only issued $900 million in unsecured bonds, we retired over $1 billion in higher coupon secured debt. Our NOI is now over 80% on encumbrance creating ample capacity to opportunistically access either this secured or the unsecured market. We issued an unsecured bond early in the year at one of the lowest 10-year recredit spreads ever and were the first multifamily rates issue a green bond. In addition to being an attractively priced piece of long-term capital, the green bond is a reflection of the many sustainable projects and initiatives that we have and continue to undertake balancing people plan it and profit. For 2019, we anticipate issuing between $700 million and $900 million in debt capital to refinance debt that either matures in 2019 or matures in 2020 but it's prepayable at par in 2019. We are very manageable development spend that we anticipate being funded entirely from free cash flow and hold that capacity and industry leading access to the full-spectrum of capital. As I just mentioned, we also have plenty of capacity to issue either unsecured or secured debt capital. For the first time in quite a while, we've also seen a convergence of pricing between the unsecured and secured markets for lower levered high-quality borrowers like our self. With that, I'll turn it back to Mark. Mark Parrell : Thanks, Bob. Just quickly on the investment front. We had a relatively quiet fourth quarter with no transactions as you saw on last night's release. We had a busy January, we acquired three properties. We continued our portion at Denver with the acquisition of a newly constructed property in the Golden Triangle neighborhood which is near downtown Denver. This 274 unit property was completed in 2017, as a 90 walk score and is slightly less than 90% occupied. We acquired it for a 110.5 million at a 4.4% cap rate on the current rent roll and a 4.6% cap rate once fully stabilized. We see the price is at about a 7% discount to current replacement cost. We now have three properties or about $385 million of capital invested in Denver. We will continue to look for opportunities to expand our presence in Denver as we think that assets in the right location, we'll produce excellent long-term returns. We do not that similar to many markets, Denver's experiencing significant new supply, this is both a challenge to near-term operating fundamentals that we do reflect in our underwriting and also an opportunity for us to buy well-located product at modest discounts to current replacement costs. Moving over to Seattle. We acquired a 174 unit's property constructed in 2016 in the South Lake Union neighborhood; this asset was acquired for $74.1 million at an acquisition cap rate of 4.6%. The property has a tremendous walk score of 97 and we were able to acquire it at a discount to current replacement cost. We like this properties location which is in walking distance of many major employers, parks, and other attractive amenity. We also added to our New York metro area portfolio with the acquisition of a 131 unit property in the desirable Paulus Hook neighborhood of Jersey City; we acquired the property for $74 million at an acquisition cap rate of 4.6%. The property has a 92 walk score and easy public access, transportation access, into much of Manhattan. On the disposition side, we're in the process of disposing of several assets. We're closing expected in late in this quarter or the second quarter. This includes a sale of an asset in Manhattan that was reported in the press, I have more to report on this transaction once this is closed. We have given guidance for $700 million of acquisitions and $700 million of dispositions in 2019. You can expect us to continue our selected portfolio pruning as we find attractive opportunities from both in acquisition and development perspective for new investment in our markets. Overall, values and cap rates are holding steady in our markets as there continues to be demand own high quality apartment assets. On the development front, during the fourth quarter we completed a development of our 100K street property in Washington D.C. which we expect to deliver at a stabilized yoke of 5.6%. We also stabilized our Cascade development in Seattle at a yield of 5.8%. We did not start any developments in the fourth quarter. Well now, let's go to the Q&A session. Operator, if you could begin? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Nick Yulico of Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. This is Trenter Hill here with Nick. Thanks for first all the market level color in your prepared remarks; that's great. Kind of a big picture question related to supply and like the theme that we continue to hear is more of it being shifted to one quarter to another from one year to another. So, now 2019 based on industry level date, it seems to be the new peak for supply deliveries of the national level. And we appreciate you deal on internal analysis of supply. But we've been talking about this for a while as it gets pushed and pushed further end of the cycle. So, when do you think we truly see the peak supply as it pertains to your markets? Mark Parrell : Hey Trent, it's Mark Parrell, thanks for that question. So, it seems that we do have this conversation every year. We always seem to have the highest supply numbers right now for the year. So, our internal estimates now for 2019 are give-or-take 77,000 units. But we fully expect 10% or 15% of that to move because it always moves. So again, we do think something will move in the 20. Right now our 2020 numbers are lower and we will be putting our an update on our numbers a little bit later in the quarter. But again, we see continued pressure on construction costs. Labor costs, materials cost, land prices is not really declined at this point. We see all that, we also see rents not growing as quickly as construction cost and we see pressure on developers and we see that growing over time. When that really comes to pass in a very significant decline, we would expect that to occur at some point but I just can't have it to guess at this juncture that at this point we do think '20 is lower than '19. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thank you very much. And just a quick follow-up something relating to your guidance. It looks like you have a 25 basis point dilutive cap rates spread between acquisitions and dispositions. And you've already announced a healthy amount of acquisitions in the mid-4% range and you have that Chelsea asset pending sale which we would assume it would be something in the low-4% cap rate range. So, I guess the question is what are you planning to buy yourself that would flip this dynamic from being accretive to delude if just to get some details on that, thank you. Mark Parrell : Sure, Trent. Bob Garechana : Yes, thank you. All we do with our guidance is give you the number that's in our estimate. So, it doesn't mean that will actually end up because we don\u2019t know exactly what we're going to buy and sell during the year. At this point we do have somewhat of an accretive trade going on but there are other assets we've identified for sale that would be higher cap rate assets. So, I could tell you there is almost equal probability that we could be 50 basis points accretive as 50 basis points dilutive. Mean, it's just a pretty small margin in between. And in terms of the impact on this year's numbers which I don\u2019t think was exactly what you asked, it's really minimal. Because it's really about the timing of these trades and because we're buying relatively early or going to be slightly accretive, my guess is in 2019 almost no matter what. Unidentified Analyst : All rightt, thank you very much. Thanks for taking the questions. Bob Garechana : Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from Nick Joseph of Citi. Please go ahead. Nick Joseph : Thanks. In the last few years you've been pretty conservative with initial same store revenue guidance that you ultimately at the high-end of your initial expectations. So, first a basic change is here with tightly set guidance. And then which markets have the largest potential variants that will drive maybe the high-end or low-end of the range? Mark Parrell : It's Parrell, and Manelis will kind of split this one up. So, in terms of anything changing in our process, no. our process is sort of both the bottoms up and the top-down process and we sort of arrived at a consensus number. So, not the process is the same. We talked our field personnel, there's often assets specific positive and negative going on. New supply where they know sort of the exact impact, maybe a renovation at a property, things of that nature. Or the top of the house we're looking at supply numbers, job growth, we're thinking about how the market moved the prior year and we sort of merged those two together and reach consensus. I'll let Michael speak to the markets with positive and kind of that. Michael Manelis : Yes. So, I think that the one way to just start thinking about this is there's four core markets that are driving 18% to 20% of our revenue which would be kind of D.C., in New York, San Francisco and L.A. so, obviously those are big focal points because if any one of those markets kind of either out performs or under performs that have more weight into the overall company. I guess, I'm just going to tell you sitting here today. I think we're up to a great start, right. You got Boston, San Francisco and New York but we feel we got good momentum and with just left towards kind of the outperform state but again we're very early in. I think on the downside we're going to watching D.C. and L.A. just for any signs of softening and the absorption of this supply which could impact our projections. But as of right now, we're not seeing anything to suggest if that's occurring. Nick Joseph : Thanks. So, then with supply coming to Oakland in the East Bay. Do you think that the new product will pull demand from San Francisco or do you expect it to be more muted somewhere toward what you've seen in New York with Long Island City? Michael Manelis : I think that's a great question and that's something obviously that we're going to be looking at. I think I even said that on the last quarter which is yes it's a little bit different than Long Island City because Oakland does have areas to go to today. So, it's a little bit more established than Long Island City. It's something that we've got to watch, I think in the next probably several weeks we're going to have one of the first deals, bigger deals, 420 units start to the free leasing's but just going to be interesting to see kind of that price relationship to San Francisco. My guess is it will come out of the box somewhere 15% to 20% discounted in rents but we'll see. And then we just got to watch their ability to absorb what happens with them to see if they do start to drop from San Francisco. Nick Joseph : Thanks. Operator : We will now take our next question from Jeffrey Spector of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Spector : Thank you, good morning. Mark, just stepping back from results for a minute. Now that you're in the CEO, see I just want to confirm from a strategy standpoint, is there any potential change or anything you've been wanting to do whether it's more development, less development market exposure. And it even say but even the balance sheet increasing leverage possibly at this point? Mark Parrell : Thanks for the question, Jeff. I've been at the company 20 years and was the CFO for an 11. So, I fully invested in this strategy. I mean the strategy is always more then changed over time and it undoubtedly we'll continue to. In last year, we went back into Denver, we telegraphed that, we talked about it, we continue as we did under David's time at the helm as we will undermine, we'll always think about markets and different types of assets we can buy in our markets. Now I think that sort of evolutionary process will continue but in terms of some dramatic changes that the board now are contemplating that that would not at this point in the case. Jeffrey Spector : Okay great, thanks. And then, just two quick follow-ups. On Oakland, I was just going to ask historically have you seen an impact when there's a new supply in Oakland in your San Fran portfolio or are we saying that it's really not a good comparison to look in the past given the changes going on in Oakland? David Neithercut : Yes, I think so. I think you got to wait and see, this is some concentrated new supply high-end stuff coming online. So, I think in the past I don\u2019t know that they've ever had this wave of the concentration all coming online in a couple of quarter period that really have an impact and really touch the ability to absorb. Mark Parrell : And Jeff, if I can just add to that a little bit, it's Mark. We do see maybe 3500+ units being delivered. This is into a market that has I know I mean the Bay area in general, the least amount of housing in the country; it needs more housing. So, whatever little blip this might cause or might not cause to the operations of our assets across the Bay in San Francisco or the few assets that we do have in each day, in the long run this market will absorb this product readily because it's just an area where there's just incredible demand for housing. It's very under supplied and so we don\u2019t look at it as some permanent disability or even frankly much more than a temporary blip. Jeffrey Spector : Okay, thanks. And then, my last follow-up is just on supply New York City, you commented that you're still expecting a decline of 50% in '19. We hosted or broke a call last week and we heard '18 supply was down more than we expected. So, we weren\u2019t sure of the slippage into '19 would decrease that estimate. But it sounds like you're sticking with the 50% decline in New York City supply. Mark Parrell : Yes. So, actually when I look back at where we thought '18 was going to be, we really have not seen a significant change at all. So, the 19,000 units that we expected kind of came in maybe one unit's look smaller, two units small units but we really didn\u2019t see that kind of slippage in New York. And again, as we think about the 2019 landscape is against our competitive footprint. Jeffrey Spector : Great. Thanks, guys. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. John Kim : Thank you. Based on your market commentary, it looks like the biggest improvement that you're seeing in 2019 in same store revenue guidance will be coming from New York. But when you look at the earn-in from a lease growth rates from last year, it does not appear to be that strong. I'm just wondering if you could provide some more commentary on your constant level in achieving this other than just supply coming down. Mark Parrell : Well, I guess I would say from an earn-in perspective New York contribute with 70 basis points stronger and better growth today than we did at this time last year. So, we do have some embedded growth in the rent wall from leases that were saying for like maybe or to the back half of the year and we've got good momentum right now. We've got demonstrated pricing power. It's not robust pricing power but it's more pricing power than we've had in a long time. And if that momentum can continue, I think we're going to be just fine with this range that we put out there. John Kim : You had strong momentum in the fourth quarter versus I think your prior year guidance in New York? I just want to make sure that was the case. Mark Parrell : Yes, both from a demand; from an occupancy; from a renewal; everything. John Kim : Okay. Also there was a commentary on waiving some late fees in D.C. and just wanted to make sure that we understood your revenue recognition when a tenant is late in paying rent. And also, is your expectation that government workers will be fully current on rents when the government shut down it's primarily over? Bob Garechana : Yes. So, I'll take real quick the revenue recognition is not waiving on late fee. So, we recognize the late fee one due. So, we recognize that through revenues almost like on a cash basis. Obviously, we didn\u2019t collect it, we would not recommend it. Mark Parrell : So, just to give you an order of magnitude, John, to help you a little here and we're talking about two dozen people. So, we're not concerned about it. We waive those late fees, so we're not going to get them. So, that's undoubtedly true. So, we do charge the accounts the late fees, we do recognize that through revenue and if they aren\u2019t paid, we have a process where a couple of months later it all gets written off. We've very low write offs in this portfolio, one of the advantages of the portfolio shift is to have a portfolio where you didn\u2019t have a lot of people that move out in the middle of the night, you didn\u2019t have a lot of people that don\u2019t pay the rent. So, write off this portfolio effectively the minimist. So, I don\u2019t expect that change as a result of this recent incident. John Kim : But the workers to your knowledge that they will be caught up in rents once they go back to work. Mark Parrell : Yes, I guess at this point there is nothing out there that would suggest that even if there are additional shutdowns that there is not going to be a retro pay catch up. And therefore, the residence won't be in a position to get caught back up nonetheless. Bob Garechana : Yes. We have, there are family members are kind of workers that were for loading, they know they're getting the money and they bid all that but that just between that readings the paper, I expect you'll get the money and then we'll get the rent. John Kim : Got it, okay thank you. Bob Garechana : Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. I just want to touch on the investment market and just maybe get your comments on kind of unlevered IR's today, how you guys are underwriting sort of acquisitions just late in the cycle and do you guys think about a down turn, do you put that in or how do you sort of think about the next possible recession? Mark Parrell : Hey Steve, it's Mark. Thanks for the good question. This is as much are the science as you know we got people on the ground really looking at this hard, we underwrite every deal. We end up bidding on a select group of oneself. I'll give you a little bit of flavor of how we're thinking about things. When you're talking about revenue assumptions in the next few years, we do feel like we have more visibility there. So, for example the Denver asset that we just bought a few weeks ago, we effectively assumed because we know there is near-term competition, no revenue growth for a couple of years and concessions. We understand that market, we know what's going in the next few years and then over time at some points things will balance themselves differently. And you'll have a year with the six in it later on. Well, what generally happens is in the near term, you have whatever you really think is going to happen in that market from your knowledge on the ground from our investment in property management teams. Going forward, you sort of revert to some sort of average in the market which generally for us and revenue growth then your five on might be somewhere in that who is depending, how we feel about the markets long-term prospects. And then you look at your cap rate, you're reversing every cap rate at the end because of a lot of the product we're buying like the stuff we're buying in Denver, a high rise. We don\u2019t see as much cap rate widening in the sale as maybe you'd see if you were buying garden product. That give you just a framework for our thought process but again picking what your seven revenue growth is going to be is definitely an estimate. Steve Sakwa : So, no effective real downturn in a market like or just nationally two, three, four years out. There isn\u2019t sort of a down 4% or 5%, 6% within a strong bounce back and could you kind of just kind of look through that basically? Mark Parrell : Well, we accomplish. Yes well, and you just said if you look through that. I mean if you think the number is going to be 350 in the market for revenue growth over a long period of time. You may have underestimated it in year four and you over estimated in year seven and that just kind of averages out. So, again the near term stuff, we underwrite tight based on having product in these markets, knowing how it's performing, having a real good feel. As you go further out, it's a little bit more of an averaging effect. Steve Sakwa : And then, just in terms of unlevered IRR's. We're on the things that you've been buying or the things you've underwritten but have a one. Where would you say the market is today and you're kind of core five or six markets? Mark Parrell : Yes. And we're seeing trades go off and we think unlevered IRRs maybe in the sixes, the stuff we've been giving the purchase has been in the sevenths. Again, some of that is skewed by Denver, maybe being a little bit higher cap rate market but the stuff we're buying in the sevens but we do see product rate. In at the sixes, maybe even in the five or high fives in terms of IRR's but again those are the deals we wouldn\u2019t plan. Steve Sakwa : And then, just lastly on development. Obviously, the pipeline for you is kind of dwindling down there or how do you sort of think about new land sites and new development starts over the next couple of years? Mark Parrell : Yes. Thanks for that question. So, on development. We've had a terrific run, we have a great team in place. We do think about it as a long-term value creator for our company. Right now, our development folks are mostly been busy with adjacent land sites; the properties we already own. We do have a couple of other land sites on the west coast that we're thinking about. But we made a decision a few years ago as we saw these costs really go up as we saw rents kind of flattened out but it really wasn\u2019t worth the risk. We completed I think a very lucrative development pipeline for the most part, there are couple of things still in process. I guess the way we think about it right now Steve is, we think about it as part of the long term mix to capital allocation for the company. I don't think you will see us accelerate that in the year or so we just don't see an opportunity to do that as yields were willing to accept to take that kind of risk. But I do think you should expect that there will be a time and a place where we will do more development for sure and I think we will constantly do these densification plays where we take a property and it's the parking lot, the back parking lot or the garage and we will do something there. We are adding units. We are adding new building and what not. Steve Sakwa : Okay, And then just quick one for Bob. Just on the debt that\u2019s expiring this year and kind of your new debt that's in guidance just kind of from a timing perspective how should we think about that and to the extent that you were to come to market with say a new ten year deal where do you think pricing is? Bob Garechana : Yes. It's a real quick on the timing. So the two components of that that are either maturing or pre-payable at par are kind of midyear, end of the day one of them is unsecured bond that's floating, swap to floating. And another one is that I think secured debt deal that I mentioned its pre-payable at par. So that's kind of midyear so I think from a modeling standpoint mid-ish year is probably pretty close. We obviously could be opportunistic if the market presented opportunity to go a little bit earlier and take them off the line, etcetera. But overall that's the timing plan. From a pricing perspective, I would say and this probably applies for secured and unsecured low levered secured for borrowers like us because as I mentioned in my comments the threads are pretty tight to each other. I would say we are probably a little bit under 4 overall. So sitting here, call it 275 treasury here and that kind of 115 area for either one. Steve Sakwa : Great, thanks very much. Mark Parrell : Thanks Steve. Operator : We will now take our next question from Drew Babin of Baird, please go ahead. Drew Babin : Hi, good morning. Mark Parrell : Good morning. Drew Babin : Moving past on the earn and assumptions moving into 2019 and looking more towards peak season, I mean the potential for continued second derivative leasing spread improvement. I guess, are you assuming that most of your markets are \u2013 are your markets kind of on average roughly in line with 18 as far as renewal and new leasing spread or are there certain markets assuming some incremental acceleration or deceleration? Michael Manelis : No, I would say and I went through each kind of market as to what those overall assumptions were, but I would say clearly in New York probably stands out where we have significant improvement in the new lease change assumptions. So the rest of the markets I would say are pretty close, Boston where you have pricing power existing is going to generate improvement in new lease change as well. And I think as we get closer in the March we will have an investor presentation deck, you get to see a little bit of those assumptions as kind of a layout by quarter as well. But I really point to the markets where I talk about kind of having some pricing power momentum. Those are the ones that our expectations are kind of geared towards improvement in new lease change and the rest is probably just holding the line on the occupancy and renewal. Drew Babin : Thank you, that's helpful. Can you talk some about the repair and maintenance costs being relatively high in 2018 off of difficult comps? I noticed that the building improvements and replacements capitalized per unit were down about 9% year-over-year in 2018. Can you talk about how the capitalized expenses were kind of going down while the expense ones are going up? Is there any different on the accounting side? Does it reflect the younger portfolio? Just curious kind of why that bifurcation is occurring? Mark Parrell : Drew, it's Mark. So specifically when you look at building improvements, building improvements are large scale systems so that's why air conditioning unit replacements on top of buildings, elevators and things of that nature. So there is some interplay between that. There is some things that when you do a big capitalized project end up falling into expense. But that interplay isn't quite right. There wasn't a switch there as much as I would like to tell you. That's what happened. It really was just these sort of additional expenses relating to slight damage that hit same store and otherwise non same store. So that really was more of it. Michael Manelis : So nothing changed on the accounting front or capitalization policy at all. Drew Babin : Okay. So what do you say in the 9% decline year-over-year. Is that just sort of asset mix over the years? Is there anything kind of behind that? Mark Parrell : Sure. Those are generally big projects, in a few cases big window replacements or sighting deals on a few mid rise units we own. So those just slide. Just move down a little bit and they'll get done in the next year. So it's really more about just timing of some big chunky projects more than anything else. Drew Babin : And then, one more for me obviously there have been some headlines about tech companies kind of reaching out and hoping to increase the inventory of affordable housing or in some cases kind of medium income type housing projects. Has there been any talk of them partnering with other capital to potentially do larger projects that might deliver more units that we're kind of currently talking about? Do you think there's any potential that these companies might reach out to EQR or other public REITs to kind of partner in these projects and would you say that the rents on them are probably a little bit too low kind of considering to ours target customer? Is there anything developing on that front or is it maybe just too early in the process? Mark Parrell : I'm thinking it's too early I mean we certainly know these people in our markets but we don\u2019t have a lot of detail on those programs at this point. We've run very affordable product before. We own some bay area stuff that I would characterize as highly affordable product. We have affordable units throughout the whole portfolio as well. So I think we have the ability to manage in our markets all types of price points if the returns make sense. So, we'd be interested in it and I'm sure possibly but I guess I just don't know enough to react to that yet. Drew Babin : Great, that's all from me. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now take our next question from Rob Stevenson of Janney, please go ahead. Rob Stevenson : Good morning guys. What's your expectation for fee growth in 2019, the application pet and all that other stuff and are there any new ones that you guys have recently implemented or will implement 19? Mark Parrell : So I would say I think right now if we look through the guidance I'm guessing it's 3% which is kind of in line with kind of where we see these other income lines going from an initiative standpoint. I'll tell you we did a hard look at the parking many years ago. Our parking revenue is up to 54 million in 2018. We actually grew parking by 3 million or 6%. We have basically the road map laid out for every single property and some of that just takes some turnover, some renewals, some changes in the leases to get that income. But if we still have a little bit of room left to optimize some of the parking income but it's not like there's significant kind of opportunities in front of us. The rest of the fees I mean it's a very strategic review asset by asset to try to understand where do you have opportunities, where do you have levers to increase. I don't think I'm aware of anything kind of on the new fee side coming in that that's worth talking about on this call. Rob Stevenson : And then what are the expected stabilized development yields on the three properties in the current pipeline? Mark Parrell : Sure bear with me for a second here. So for West End 6 for 249 third square 5 and for 1401 East Madison 58. Rob Stevenson : And what's the $0.08 gap between the REIT and normalized FFO guidance for this year? Michael Manelis : Yes. So for 2018 or 2019, sorry? Rob Stevenson : For 19, the guidance. Michael Manelis : Yes. So for 19 the guidance there's a page in the very back. The biggest issue and we noted on the disclosure or the biggest item is the write off, or anticipated write off of an unamortized discount on a tax-exempt bond that we would expect to incur in conjunction to a plan disposition that Mark may have alluded to in his comment. Mark Parrell : Yes, so it's a non-cash charge Rob, so it's cost we incurred when we bought this asset a long time ago and we have to write it off. So that runs through the REIT and EPS versions of FFO after our normalized version and that's the biggest item. Rob Stevenson : And I know that there hasn't been any sort of formal plan put out there yet Mark, but given that the administration says that they have the ability to do something with the GSTs I mean what's \u2013 how you guys thinking about that and does that impact any of the timing for you guys in terms of dispositions and/or the way that you guys think about financing in the space through the remainder of the year? Michael Manelis : Yes, I'll take this real quick and I'm sure Mark can take you back on it as well. So we're familiar with the same kind of media reports that you guys have seen and it's been all over the page right in terms of -- as of late most recently it's in the privatization kind of rumors. What I'll say kind of more specifically and I think answering your question on 19 is at the moment we see no disruption to the GSE and it's the kind of the operating business as usual. They had very large production volumes in 2018 prior to the change of the regulator whose term expired at the end of 2018. They put out their caps which were very similar to what they were previously. So for 19 we wouldn't expect anything to kind of impact our position or their kind of operations overall. I guess what I would say kind of longer-term is who knows right, I think the bigger issue that will drive kind of GST reform is both political but also probably single-family financing in this country and so it is unclear. From a specific standpoint I'd say for us we would certainly be less impacted or less negatively impacted by GST reform I would say for two reasons. The first as it relates to funding ourselves. We have very strong access to capital as I alluded to in my comment particularly strong relative to the private market which is very reliant on the GSTs whether it's for stabilized assets or for refinancing their construction loans I mean every bank in the country basically when doing a construction loan underwrite to take out to the GSTs. So we benefit kind of from a direct standpoint of having all this access. The other thing I would say is our portfolio on the secured debt front it's very attractive to other secured lender types as well so we don't have a lot of the large-scale suburban kind of stuff that is probably more the core GSP product today than what we might have had ten years ago. Mark Parrell : Yes that's the point I just want to emphasize Rob without beaten this to death is we got rid of a lot of the product that we thought was more susceptible to GST risk some time ago but some of these dispositions including Florida and the Denver suburban stuff this product we thought but really only financed fear was the GST market. So we don't feel and it so it's not changing our plans. Most people who buy assets from us are buying free and clear and you may finance it later at some point but the financing market is not particularly relevant to them. They are cash buyers. Rob Stevenson : Thanks guys. Stay warm. Mark Parrell : Yes. Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you and I guess given the temperatures maybe that Florida assets look a little attractive now. Just two questions, first you guys are not alone in facing operating expenses and taxes are what they are, you can grieve them all you want but that is what it is. But wages especially with the sustained with this economic recovery ultra low unemployment and the fact that you've had a lot of local mandates for higher minimum wages just seems to be something that's continuing to weigh on the apartment. Some talk about more automation but still you need people at the properties to run them, to fix them, etcetera. So do you expect that for the next few years we're going to see force type percent expense growth driven by payroll or do you think there's some offsets here? Mark Parrell : Yes. I believe in the mean reversion theory of these long term expenses. I mean over the last five years our expense growth rate is average 2.5% certainly we're expecting it to be higher in 2019 than it's been. Real estate taxes are what they are, but some of these sales of these New York assets where we've affected the 421A growth in our real estate tax line item that stuff Alex is going to help us over time. So we expect that number to go down here. These appraisers have noticed how well apartments have done. They've raised their values. They've taxed us more. At some point that will change and those values will go down and we'll have more appeal success that's just the cycle. In terms of headcount and wages and stuff I would say the same. Right now with so much new products being built there's just a lot of competition for talent as Bob suggested. At some point that'll wax and wane. So I don't I don't know I don't feel like 4% is a run rate. I feel like that's just kind of this year's number and I think there's some good chance it could be lower depending on how things break during a year. I know Michael if you got anything you would add. Michael Manelis : Yes, I think I guess I can bring up that obviously from an automation standpoint we're about to introduce pilots to kind of go after mobility on the maintenance side of our business. I don't know if that that's really not a head counting that's more around utilization. So it's allowing us to maybe get some more stuff done in-house and have less dependency on contractors but it I think you are right some of these minimum wage increases and they're not done in 19 they're going to continue going and that is going to continue to keep pressure on any of the contract labor services that we utilize. So I think we're taking a hard look at all that trying to make sure that we've optimized, trying to make sure that the staff is as utilized as possible. So I think there will be things that come out of the learning from 19 that will get folded into 2020 but I don't think we're in a position to really impact the 2019 with any of these types of initiatives yet. Alexander Goldfarb : And then the second question is as you look here in New York obviously Albany is now all democrat rent control is up this summer. There's a lot of talk about a lot of, taking out a lot of things that were more favorable to landlords. From any of your local real estate contacts especially who deal with Albany. Is there any concern at all that rent control may spread to market rate units and/or that they may start to limit the ability to raise rents within existing 421A deals on either the 20% restricted or I think someone mentioned that the other 80% is still subject to some qualification. But just sort of any commentary of what you're hearing as Albany didn't do debates renewing the rent control this summer? Mark Parrell : Yes thanks Alex. Listen this is a very complex area. New York rent control regulations are very involved that we have several full-time staff members who administer this. It's that complex. We are used to these regulations. The Governor was rather general in his remarks. I don't have anything specific to react to. We will continue to advocate through our local trade association as we did very effectively in California that rent control in the long run and New York give me listen a rent control New York forever and it hasn't helped keep prices down to somehow lower level on workforce housing or produced more affordable and workforce housing I would argue. I think enlisting the private sector by having incentives like the affordable New York program, by having zoning that's more inclusive things like that or where you're going to make a real dent in it. The industry does want to be helpful both in New York and otherwise and in fact Alex, the annual trade show event for the industry is going out right now in California and I know right now because we've got senior people attending that there's conversations about New York, about California, about all the places that have these affordable housing issues but this isn't an area where you can legislate a good outcome. You need to really enlist I think the private sector. I think the industry is willing to do its part. So I can't answer your question specifically because there's no detail. Once there are there will be on it but our sense is in New York that the industry association has been pretty effective in education and we'll hope the same occurs this time. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay thanks Mark. Mark Parrell : Thank you, Alex. Operator : We will now take our next question from Hardik Goel of Zelman and Associates. Please go ahead. Hardik Goel : Hi Mark, thanks for taking my question. Thanks for providing color on your markets earlier regarding 2019 guidance and as I look across them I'm just wondering where are the ranges the widest? Which markets do you see potential for upside and also on the other end potential for downside and what are the factors influencing you there? Michael Manelis : Yes, this is Michael. I guess I would say from a range perspective we have equal upside and downside in almost every one of our markets relative to our midpoint. I think as I alluded to earlier in one of the question, the markets that have the elevated supply so we will be \u2013 DC and LA and they're driving 18% of our revenue, other markets where the range could be tested both on the upping and the downside. So it's the markets where we need to watch the absorption of the elevated supply and we need to balance kind of the pricing power that we have in place. Right now like I said earlier the dashboards are all green we've got good pricing power in those markets. So sitting here today I would say we have minimal on the downside risk. But I think the way to think about it is the markets that are contributing the majority of the revenue growth and where is their elevated supply and that's kind of how we're thinking about it. Hardik Goel : Thanks. Operator : We will now take our next question from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Rich Hill : Good morning guys and thank you for the time. Once just come back to two things one of which you've already spoken about maybe some of that add links. But New York City looks like you put up a really nice number in 4Q and expect that acceleration to occur. One of the things that I know you and I have chatted about in the past is sort of how neighborhood by neighborhood New York City is and certainly our own analysis supports that. So I'm curious when you think about the various neighborhoods and where your properties are located what's driving that outperformance relative to maybe what we see in trends in overall New York City. Is it lack of supply or is it just people unwilling to move or a little combination of both? Mark Parrell : I think it's a little bit of a combination of both and then you also got to remember what our earning or what our embedded growth is sitting in some of these neighborhoods. They maybe didn't have as much pressure on supply in 18 that allowed us to start getting some momentum on raising rents and getting some momentum on pricing power. So Manhattan still has an attractiveness to it, at least we see it in our foot traffic. We see it in the demand for our product type. And sitting here today when we look through New York and I go through almost every submarket, every sub market is demonstrating more pricing power today on where our rents are in the marketplace than where they were this time last year. So I think you're right to think about at a sub-market level we could see kind of deviation in the projection and in fact our own projections have ranges going down to 1.5% up to all the way up to a 4% based on various sub-markets. So I think some of it is what is embedded with us and some of it is what should we see is the competitive landscape that we're going to be facing in 19. Rich Hill : Got it, that's helpful thank you. I mean I want to come back to the supply comment. One of the things that we focused on and we'll keep hearing a lot about is a tremendous amount of private equity dry powder that that's on the sidelines. I'm wondering if you get any sense that the supply which continues to get pushed out is really driven by builders anticipating that maybe that private equity wants to go into apartments and they can't find enough apartments to buy. So is there a chance that developing it maybe last longer than we're all anticipating because of all this dry powder that might be attracted to multifamily or do you think that's maybe misguided? Mark Parrell : Yes I'm not sure that dry powder is looking for development exposure. I mean some of it is but I think some of it is probably interested in value add and some of its interested in core and different flavors and the continuum there. I would say that lately we've had more anecdotal evidence to the contrary in terms of more inbound calls to Alan George, our Chief Investment Officer and his team of people that have sites tied up but can't find the equity to do it or their equity went away and they're looking for someone else to jump in and wondered if we were interested. So I'm not suggesting that yet a full trend but we are hearing more of it. We are also seeing and again not yet meaningfully, but we also seeing land come available at prices that were lower or less high than before. So to us I'm not sure that that dry powder is waiting for development. I think if you really wanted to do development and you didn't care too much about the yield you figure out a way to do more development. I think a lot of that is probably interested in other kind of plays in real estate in general or in apartments and right now I kind of see equity. Equity is probably a little bit more hesitant in our opinion on development now than it was a year ago, but until something dislocates they're still going to put some measure of capital into that because the plays work so far. Rich Hill : Got it, thank you, that's helpful, that's all for me guys. Mark Parrell : Thank you, Rich. Have a good day. Operator : We will now take our next question from John Guinee of Stifel, please go ahead. John Guinee : Great, just nice quarter by the way guys. Just building on the last couple questions on development, the merchant builders dominate the business. What do you think the yield on cost that they are willing to accept versus the yield on cost that you're willing to accept? Is that a overall 25 basis point gap or a 150 basis point gap? Mark Parrell : That's almost an existential question for us because when we think about development it isn't with the merchant builder mentality of what's the cap rate if the market is trading at 4 in a quarter we need to get 5 in a quarter and otherwise we won't build it. We're looking at a price per unit, a price per square foot, feeling that this location has been hard to buy I mean a lot of what we built coming out of the great recession that we got from our stone was [chat] with properties in San Francisco because we had such a hard time finding stuff to buy. So we figured we had to build it if we wanted to own it. So I guess, I\u2019d tell you I think, the weak industry in general in Equity Residential for sure on the apartment development side just thinks a little bit differently and more like a long-term investor. So I think most of these developers that are private guys who build until someone doesn't give them the money and they can have different yield expectations that they are what they are. I think for a company like ours we are very disciplined that's one of the advantages and we're perfectly willing to sit on our hands and like I said continue to look at things that are already in the portfolio to create densification and/or buy assets that already exist. So I don't know that it can be reduced to the manner you just reduced it to. John Guinee : If you try to reduce it to that manner could you? Mark Parrell : It's probably too cold outside. Well, we might accept a little lower spread than they are if it's really hard to build asset in like San Francisco. We might require a lot more in a place that maybe is a little bit easier to build like DC because we have the ability to go optionally between buying existing streams of income and building new streams of income. So I guess that would be my full answer. John Guinee : Great, thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from Tycho Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Tycho Okusanya : Yes. Good afternoon. Keep warm in Chicago please. First question, the 700 to 900 million of debt you are planning to raise in 19 and the debt you are planning to pay off I just wanted to confirm from a payoff perspective it's the 450 million notes due July 1, 2019. And also the 500 million due July 1, 2020 is that what you're planning to pay off? Mark Parrell : That's correct. Tycho Okusanya : Perfect. Second question, the green bonds congrats on getting that done. Just kind of curious what kind of buyers you're seeing for that specific type of bond and it's generally the type of REITs you're getting on them whether they're more advantageous and just issuing regularly on secured bond? Mark Parrell : Yes. So I'll cover kind of a buyer base and the differentiation between a green bond and a conventional bond. Obviously with the green bond you do attract a different type of buyer base in part but not in total as what I would say. So in part, this deal that we lasted did probably have 15% or 20% of capital that came from dedicated kind of green institutions that had a mandate from their stakeholders to invest in these types of bonds and that is certainly helpful to the overall demand as you're issuing a bond. To kind of get to your second point which is from a pricing perspective it is really hard to quantify whether or not you get kind of any differential between the spread on a conventional bond versus a green bond. That being said obviously demand for our paper which has been high given our credit quality and kind of our reputation in the space for fixed income is very good. It's helpful to always have more buyers. It was certainly helpful in the market in the fourth quarter because the market in the fourth quarter was pretty choppy. So it did assist us in that regard. Tycho Okusanya : That's helpful and then another one for me if you don't mind appreciate the intimation about renewal rates in January and kind of an overall sense of what it could look like this year. Could you just talk a little bit more around kind of new rates, kind of new rent growth and what that's shaping up to be there 1Q overall views for the year? Mark Parrell : So the projection for the first quarter is that what you're asking on new lease change? Tycho Okusanya : On new lease change yes, just some general thoughts about for the year that's built into your forecast? Mark Parrell : So I don't have it broken down by quarter in front of me. I know that in the fourth quarter of 18, the new lease change was down at negative 2.4 and I think as I\u2019ve said on previous call not really thinking that that metric should be looked at on a quarterly basis as much as it should be looked at kind of the annual year-over-year basis. I'm happy to kind of share it as we get through the first quarter. I don't have it down with me right now as to how we broke that improvement up. My guess is most of the improvement in new lease change that I talked about at the top level is occurring in the second and third quarter as we start to experience pricing power in the peak leasing season but I'm sure there's an improvement over Q4 and that I'm sure we stagger it up as we work through the year and then we take Q4 of 19 back down. Tycho Okusanya : And kind of -- for 19 over and last 12 months I'd basis are you expecting that number to eventually turn positive? Mark Parrell : Yes. So for the full year revenue guidance we would expect new lease change to be positive 10 basis points. Tycho Okusanya : 10 basis points. Excellent, thank you very much. Operator : We will now take our next question from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Wes Golladay : Yes, good morning guys. Looking at the wage growth you're seeing in your markets I know it's at your property level you\u2019re seeing 4% to 5% but can give us a sense of what you expected for the overall markets that EQR markets and which markets are you seeing the biggest buildup in affordability? Mark Parrell : So it's Mark. So you're asking less about high like wage growth in general of our residents? Wes Golladay : Yes. Mark Parrell : So just to be clear about the data we have is a little bit limited on this. So we only pull our residents, are able to effectively request what to take when they first apply to lease portfolio. They're not as forthcoming afterwards. So we're trying to do renewal negotiations. So we don't necessarily know what's happened. So again it's a little bit of an estimate. Generally speaking as we see it the portfolio has had higher wage growth by our residents and certainly the best way to look at it is that affordability statistic compared to our rent continues to be pretty well. There's room we think to raise rents the old-fashioned way because of the wage growth and just the fact that in our segment are more affluent renter segments there's room to raise rents because the rent income ratio is not terribly high. Michael Manelis : And it really hasn't moved much either on a trailing 12-month, we're at 19.3% and our ranges in our market go from 17.5% to 23% with Washington, Seattle and New York kind of being the lowest and like that 17.5% to 18% ratio and Southern Cal averages at the highest at 21.3%. Mark Parrell : Is that helpful Wes? Wes Golladay : That is fantastic. That was what I was looking for. So fantastic there and then for your employees now there's a 4 % to 5% wage pressure you are seeing. Is there any markets that stand out or maybe West Coast versus East Coast? Mark Parrell : No, I would say it's kind of just across the board that we are experiencing that. Wes Golladay : Okay thanks a lot and stay warm. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from [Indiscernible]. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys thanks for taking the question and good results. Just a question on the tax cuts in Jobs Act. There was some clarification about two weeks ago on some of the deductions and the path through. Has there been any adjustment on your side? Have you guys gone through all the new legislation and these clarifications, has there been any updates on your side for any implications on that? Mark Parrell : No I mean there's macro implications and Bob may supplement my answer but there's sort of big and small implications. I mean what the tax cuts did is actually give our residents on average more cash and I think you're asking a more technical question, Bob is going to answer it more general way initially. It gave our residents more cash because they weren't taking, they were now able to take a larger standard deduction. So for us it's generally been okay. A negative in our markets could be that some of these jurisdictions were in our relatively high state local tax jurisdictions and if those taxes aren't deductible is it harder for those jurisdictions to raise capital to renovate subways in places like New York and DC and things of that nature. In terms of the technical aspects again Bob and I can go back and forth a little bit with you but generally speaking they have not been terribly meaningful to us. We appreciate the work the industry association did on the pass through stuff. There's some technical depreciation things that still need to be resolved but there's nothing that we're watching with a great deal of concern at this juncture. Unidentified Analyst : It was more on the technical side, if there was any kind of additional pass through that you could take advantage of. But obviously on the FF&E there's a bit more flexibility on that side as well. Has that created any opportunities for you to perhaps move into furnishing, move into furnished departments in greater scale or are you guys still pretty comfortable where you are? Mark Parrell : Well, our tax person will be so excited to talk to you about. So certainly we can do depreciation studies if we needed to lower our taxable income and that's why people do these sorts of studies and we've done it before. So you can reclassify some things into a faster depreciable class. What's possible we could do that we're aware that that exists we don't need to do that right now. So it's fine to sit where it is and if we need to do that study we will. Unidentified Analyst : And just that the last thing is also on legislation but it's more of Boston, Cambridge focused and I know you got a question earlier about some of the rent control concepts that are being thrown out there. The Mayor of Boston recently is trying to impose a cap of 5% on tenants that are over the age of 75 which is effectively a stealth rent control and things like right to purchase and of course Cambridge being what it is, is they're also trying to impose some things like paid relocation expenses for evictions and larger rent increases. How I mean, as you have more pricing power with your tenants and there's going to be more, there's really more ability to push up the rent. Obviously the government's are going to get more involved particularly in Boston and Cambridge. So I mean, how worried are you about this? Is this I mean, this is something that's going to gain a lot of steam? Mark Parrell : Yes. Well people thought that in California and we want a resounding victory the industry did through I think a good educational campaign. Once people understand that this is not a productive way to solve a problem you tend to get a better reaction from voters. I mean Cambridge had rent control for a long time and it worked very badly and in fact there's academic studies about it and that was one of the reasons they got rid of it some years ago. I realized memories are short, the industry does need to stay very engaged. You can expect we will be. We have very senior guy in Boston who is involved with the Boston Apartment Association and the different functions groups in Boston that are involved on the industry's behalf and we will continue to have that conversation. But again, I think enlisting private industry and creating more workforce and affordable housing is the way to solve a problem. I think a lot of the things you mentioned certainly are negative and it's our job to have a conversation about those and they're not just negative for us we think they're just negative in general. I think they're not going to provide more affordable housing. I think they're going to do the opposite over time. Unidentified Analyst : Agreed, all right that's it for me and I'll say the prerequisite of a stay warm. Thanks guys. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : We will now take our final question from Tycho Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Tycho Okusanya : Yes, thanks again for indulging me. 2019 guidance does that have any expectations forecast in regards to any benefits from HQ2 or Google which you did discuss in your comments? Michael Manelis : No. There's nothing embedded in our guidance either in New York or DC regarding those expansions. I think our view right now it's a positive psychological impact. It reinforces like Mark said in his opening remarks as to why we're in those markets to begin with and I think it's, like I said it's too early to kind of see any economic impact from that. Tycho Okusanya : Understood, thank you. Operator : This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to your host for any additions or closing remarks. Mark Parrell : Well, we thank you all for your time today for sticking with us and what was a pretty long call and we'll see many of you on the conference circuit over the next few months. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Please go ahead. Marty McKenna : Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's first quarter 2019 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; and Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer is here with us for the Q&A. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now I'll turn the call over to Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Thank you, Marty. Good morning and thanks for joining us today. We are pleased to delivered growth in our same-store revenues, net operating income and normalized FFO that exceeded our expectations for the quarter. 2019 is off to a strong start with demand for our product remaining deep and new supply being absorbed well across all of our markets. We are also benefiting from a sizable dropping new competitive supply in both in New York and Boston markets. This strong demand across our markets is creating high occupancy which is allowing us to push rate. We're just beginning the primary leasing season, but if these trends hold we would expect to deliver same-store revenue growth and normalized FFO growth near the top end of our guidance ranges. As is our custom, we'll wait until our second quarter call at the end of July to revise our full-year guidance. After I discuss our investment activity in the quarter, I'll turn the call over to Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer to give you color on our operating performance. And after that we'll open the call up to your questions. So, switching to investments on the acquisition side on the fourth quarter call, I gave you details on three apartment properties, we acquired early in the first quarter of 2019. We acquired no other assets in the first quarter, but after the end of the quarter we acquired a 366 unit apartment property in Rockville, Maryland that's a suburb of Washington D.C. This property was built in 2016 and is fully stabilized. The purchase price was approximately $103.5 million and the acquisition cap rate was 5.3%. Our investment strategy for over a decade has been to acquire and develop urban and den suburban properties in our markets, while we have acquired and develop more urban assets of late. We also continue to seek well located product in the suburbs that share certain characteristics with our urban assets like being proximate to high wage employment and other positive drivers of apartment demand having high household incomes and where the rent to income ratio is similar to our other assets in the market. By that, I mean that the rent to income ratio is relatively low. Assets that are walkable are very convenient to amenities by car and we're single family owned housing is less affordable compared to rental apartment housing. The Rockville asset checked all these boxes, we owned other assets in this submarket and think this property complements the existing portfolio. You should expect us to continue to look for opportunities like these in our markets. We did not sell anything in the first quarter of 2019, but subsequent to the end of the quarter, we sold our 800 Sixth Avenue Asset in Manhattan for approximately $237.5 million. This property is subject to the New York 421A program and its sale will reduce our property tax expense growth rate and improve our NFFO growth rate over time. We continue to look to acquire properties in Manhattan and elsewhere in the New York area that meet our acquisition parameters. Our guidance continues to call for $700 million of acquisitions and $700 million of dispositions in 2019. The number of assets that we're marketing in the first quarter that meet our acquisition parameters were relatively low. We expect the number of suitable assets for sale to grow as the year goes on. Overall cap rates are holding steady in our markets and values are increasing modestly with growing NOI. There continues to be considerable demand own high quality apartment assets in all our markets. And now, I'll turn the call over to Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer. Michael Manelis : Thank you, Mark. So strong demand, better pricing power, lower turnover and record high levels of customer satisfaction continue to deliver strong momentum on the revenue front. Occupancy and renewals were slightly better but mostly in line with what we expected. Gains on new lease change were stronger than we expected which was a result of both better pricing power and having fewer units turnover during the period. In the earnings release, we have included a new schedule on Page 13, that shows pricing trends for the quarter. As I've stated in previous calls looking at these trends for any given quarter will not tell the complete income story, but they assist and understanding the relationship to previous year comp period and the potential momentum of the market. We included our full-year revenue assumptions by market in the March Investor Presentation posted online. Sitting here today, our portfolio is 96.6% occupied compared to 96.3% the same week last year. April's achieved renewal increase was 5.1% and we expect May and June to be approximately 5%. If our current momentum continues for the next couple of months we would expect our full-year revenue performance to be towards the high-end of our guidance range. This will mostly be due to stronger new lease pricing and a slight gain in occupancy. It is also important to note that our comp periods for the remaining quarters are more challenging than the first quarter. So let me provide you some color by market. Boston had a strong first quarter which was in line with our rental income expectations with stronger pricing power, gaining steam throughout the quarter. While increases in parking and retail revenue contributed to our results this quarter, our portfolio is benefiting from a pause and new competitive supply with the 2900 units expected in 2019 coming online later this year. Today the portfolio was demonstrating more pricing power than expected with base rents in Boston being 4% greater than they were the same week last year. The Boston portfolio is 96.6% occupied and the achieved renewal increases for April are 4.7%. So while we expect competitive supply to increase in 2020 the overall demand fundamentals for this market are very strong and the absorption outlook is positive. Moving to New York, the 2.4% reported revenue growth was better than expected and was driven by strong consistent occupancy at 96.5% and improved pricing power. This market also had a 7% increase in foot traffic for the quarter which was the highest year-over-year gain amongst all of our markets. Market pricing remain disciplined which will allow us to continue to use concessions at a very targeted level. During the quarter we use 50% fewer concession dollars than in 2018. The new supply and our competitive footprint is approximately 50% lower than an 18% with expected deliveries just under 10,000 units, the deliveries are concentrated in Long Island City and Brooklyn and to-date our operations have not been negatively impacted from this supply. In fact, our Brooklyn submarket delivered some of the best revenue results in the market. The New York portfolio is 97.1% occupied and April achieved renewal increases are at 3.9%. So Washington D.C. had a really strong quarter strength and occupancy and pricing power during the quarter was definitely greater than what we expected. Although, the rate of job growth has declined from last year, unemployment remains below the national average. Professional and business services was a bright spot posting a strong gain of 18,000 jobs or 9.6% increase over the same period last year. Our Northern Virginia submarkets are strong which is likely being fueled by procurement dollars being spent on defense as well as growth in technology employment. We were forecasting very limited pricing power for 2019 due to the quantity and concentration of new supply in our submarkets and potential slowdowns in absorption. We continue to be cautious about further improvement in this market. Today, our portfolio is 97% occupied with April renewals at 4.3%. Moving over to the West Coast, Seattle also delivered stronger pricing power during the quarter than what we expected. Seattle supply is being absorbed as the deliveries are shifting from the CBD to the suburban Eastside. Recently, several articles have stated that the Seattle area is filling up new apartment faster than any region in the country. Strong demand fueled by tech employment appears to be keeping pace with the high levels of new supply in this market. Large employers also continue to show strength and commitment to this market. Amazon has over 10,500 jobs posted in Seattle and another 500 now posted for Bellevue. Facebook also started moving into a new South Lake Union location which is directly across the street from one of our recent acquisitions. Overall, the next several months to present an opportunity to capture the strengthen demand and grow both rate and occupancy in this market. We are 96.7% occupied with April renewals at 5.6%. Next step in San Francisco, with jobless rates below the 3% mark, companies are running out of workers to hire and it is not a surprise that the pace of job growth is slowing. That being said demand for our product remains very strong. We had a 6.3% increase in foot traffic for the quarter which was the second highest year over year gain amongst all of our markets. Our Downtown portfolio which represents 22% of our income in this market, delivered the strongest revenue growth amongst all of the submarkets in the Bay Area. This is in contrast to our East Bay portfolio which produced the lowest revenue growth and also had a reduction in occupancy and foot traffic year-over-year, during the quarter. We are confident that whatever short-term pressure may be placed on our portfolio from deliveries in Oakland and the rest of the Bay will more than offset by the insatiable demand for housing in the Bay Area. Our San Francisco portfolio is 95.8% occupied which is about 20 basis points less than it was last year, with gains in most submarkets being offset by declines in the East Bay. April renewal increases are 6% and we continue to see strong retention results. Moving down to Los Angeles. LA performed as expected during the quarter. On the supply front, we continue to see delays in new supply deliveries due to labor shortages on the construction side of the business and we expect that trend to continue. The Downtown Metro submarket for us is a large area stretching from the core Downtown area through Mid-Wilshire Koreatown and over to the Hollywood area. With almost 20% of our revenue in this market, we saw over 5,000 units delivered last year and are currently tracking about 5,500 additional units for 2019. Concessions of 6 weeks to 8 weeks appear to be the norm for projects currently in lease up in the Downtown Metro. Our Downtown Metro portfolio is performing well, but 96.1% occupancy and 3% revenue growth for the quarter despite the pressure from the supply. Many of our Downtown Metro assets have a boutique like feel and are typically at a price point below the new highly monetized assets. In addition to Downtown we believe that supply pressure will continue throughout the year in both San Fernando Valley with about 15% of our overall market revenue and the West LA submarket with about 25% of our market revenue. The major difference between the two being absorption in West LA will be higher given the strong job growth from online content companies. The LA portfolio is 96.4% occupied as compared to 96.1% the same week last year and our April renewal increase was 5.8%. Moving to Orange County results for the quarter were slightly better than expected driven by higher occupancy. Base rents in Irvine had been decelerating since January as expected due to the pressure from new supply. Job growth is slowing but the overall outlook for this market remains positive with 3% plus revenue expectations. Today we are 96.5% occupied and have achieved a 5.7% increase on April renewals. And last but not least San Diego. Military spending remains strong, we experience some supply pressure downtown that resulted in limited pricing power and lower than expected gains on new leases, earlier in the quarter. But we have seen momentum pickup in late March and April and as of today San Diego is 96.6% occupied and achieved increases in April are 6%. On the initiatives front, we are focused on creating the right overall digital experience for our prospects residents and employees. During 2019, we are launching a number of new initiatives to further enhance self-service and on demand functionality in the sales and maintenance side of the business, including but not limited to a new resident portal, self-guided tours, mobility for our service teams, testing smart homes and introducing our prospects to LA, which is our artificial intelligence leasing a system. Impact from operating efficiencies gained will likely be in 2020 and 2021. These are exciting times for our industry from a technology standpoint and we are confident that redefining the digital experience and leveraging new technology in our industry will create operating efficiencies for the years to come. Let me close with a huge shout out to the employees of Equity Residential. We continue to have strong momentum as we enter the leasing season and their focus on delivering remarkable experiences to our prospects and residents is greatly appreciated. Thank you. And operator we are now ready to go to the question-and-answer session. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Nicholas Joseph : Thanks. Mark, you sold the New York City asset in April. As you marketed the asset, what did you learn about the current transaction market in terms of interest or buyer pool given the potential uncertainty surrounding New York rent control? Mark Parrell : Thanks for that question Nick. Listen the buyer pools generally have been smaller now than they were a few years ago, but sufficient and certainly this asset cleared with relatively no difficulty, I think the asset underwriting process with 421a is a little bit different, everyone knows what those numbers are and what those increases are. But, I think folks that aren't public reporting companies like us have a little bit of an advantage because they are deals that you have very good IRR on. I mean between the two 421a assets we sold. So that's the 101 West End deal last year and this asset which together, the 806 asset which together about $600 million of sale proceeds. We've got a 10% annual IRR on those assets unlevered, so we did very well. So I think the private buyers are very happy with those sorts of returns, very comfortable with those escalations because they understand that the assets kind of accumulating value for the mark-to-market at the end, and again the asset, these are generally saleable assets and not with a great deal of difficulty. Nicholas Joseph : Thanks. And you talked about EQR's investment strategy, are you seeing a pricing or IRR differential between urban assets and well located suburban assets that make one more attractive right now? Mark Parrell : Yes. I know your questions about IRR, but I'll start by saying cap rates in general across both markets and between markets, between coastal and secondary markets have really collapsed on each other. I mean a lot of stuff is trading in the forces that didn't trade in the forces before. So there's just a real compression of cap rates going on. I do think that some of the urban product trades at a lower IRR because it has a lower cap rate because it's got less risk associated with it. But generally speaking, the value add trades again our trading continue to trade well, but maybe a little bit less demand there. But between urban and suburban right now again it's so competitive that there's not a great deal with difference between IRR demands. But I do think IRRs are still generally lower on the buyer side when you're buying an asset in an urban center city location. Nicholas Joseph : Thanks. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Shirley Wu with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Shirley Wu : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Mark Parrell : Good morning. Shirley Wu : Good morning. So given the political climate around housing affordability, I think I'd want to carry it back to what you're hearing regarding, let's say, rent stabilization in New York and even other housing markets across the country, like California. So just your latest thoughts on those prospects? Mark Parrell : Sure. Thanks for the question Shirley. So just generally, I mean there is rent control discussions going on in many of our markets through various trade associations we belong to we're very active. We're able to discuss these things with policy makers and just get the point across that solving affordable housing \u2013 the affordable housing crisis in our various markets is not about limiting new supply of workforce and affordable housing, but encouraging that sort of supply whether it's through zoning reform, regulatory reform programs like the old New York 421a deal. So we feel like we've got some real traction in that conversation and we'll continue to press it. As it relates to New York which was part of your specific question, that's a very complex rent control regime and there are a lot of things going on. It does need to be reauthorized by mid-June and so we're in the middle of those conversations again through the various trade associations. But we just have to try and get the point across that continuing to limit the incentive for the private side to create new housing will not solve this problem. So that's the message the industry has that we continue to sort of advocate. Shirley Wu : Got it. And so on the other side, I'm going to switch to supply. So on your previous calls, you've mentioned that it\u2019s safe to say, Oakland submarket as well as downtown and West L.A., there's been markets that are probably a little bit more challenging and that could potentially impact your production. And we're hearing is that there's been some weakness in overseas as well. How do you balance this in your revenue projections, again, let's say a stronger markets like New York that's outperforming. And how do you think that's going to impact the projection going into 2Q? Mark Parrell : I want to make sure, I understand your question does it get a little garbled, but you're talking about supply production in Orange County as well as in the bay area specifically in East Bay and sort of comparing them to the performance in some of the East Coast markets. Did I catch that correctly? Shirley Wu : Yes. And how you think, let's say, the rest of the year is going to play out? Mark Parrell : Sure. Michael Manelis : Okay. So this is Michael, I think I can address that. So I think on the last call, we talked about slowness that we were seeing kind of in Orange County and our full-year projection actually had lower revenue projected for 2019 versus 2018. We kind of see the supply that we're tracking. I think just under 4,000 units for Orange County in 2019 and a very consistent competitive standpoint of what we experienced last year, we actually did a little better than what we thought in Q1. But again, that was off of a reduced kind of run rate knowing that we were going to be facing the competition. Moving over into the Bay Area, I guess I would say, we're seeing pressure on East Bay. I don't necessarily point that to the deliveries coming online in Oakland yet. I think that's still TBD as to what that poll is going to be whether that's going to attract from downtown San Francisco. But when we built our full-year, we kind of anticipated and we look at when are these deliveries coming to market. So I don't really see any kind of change right now. I will tell you the momentum in Q1 in San Francisco outside of the East Bay may mitigate any impact we're going to have from that supply. And as you move over to the East Coast and you think about New York, we see the reduction in supply in New York. We thought we were going to have better pricing power. We were expecting that the momentum is stronger than what we thought. So I think as we play out for the balance of the year as I alluded to in the opening remarks, if these trends continue that we're seeing in these markets for the next couple of months as we start writing more and more leases that is going to put us to the high end of our income range. Shirley Wu : Got it. Thanks for the color Michael. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Nicholas Yulico : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I understand waiting until the second quarter to adjust guidance, but perhaps you can just tell us what would be the negatives that could reasonably happen between now and then that would prevent you from raising same-store guidance. I mean which markets are the risk here? Mark Parrell : Sure. It's Mark and then Michael may supplement this. I mean over the next few months as you know with leasing season, we have approaching half of our leases turning over in the span of a few months. So you've got variables in rate, you got certainly variables in occupancy that are very relevant. So it's just there's and we're talking about pretty fine numbers. When you start talking about whether your growth rate is \u2013 the midpoint of our guidance being 2.7, 2.8 those are very small differences in the level of precision we're talking about here. So what I'd say to you is what can change push you up or down there's things as simple as a temporary occupancy blip maybe some undisciplined supply in one of our submarkets things like that that could push those numbers down. That don't mean that anything systemic has happened in that market, but that Nick you're going to miss \u2013 we're going to miss the very, very top end of the range by something, by some factor. So what I would say is you've got all of that that you need to consider and that's effectively impossible for us to predict at this early point in the leasing season. Michael Manelis : Nick, the only thing I guess I would add to that is just from a downside risk perspective, it's really watching southern California just to see if there's any additional softening. Because to me that's where the risk sits right now. The other the trajectory of these other markets, it will be remote that all of a sudden we see a very sharp pause that then dilutes our occupancy so quickly. But I think in Southern California right now it's where we need to kind of keep our eyes on it. Nicholas Yulico : And just falling up on Southern California, I mean I think you said that labor shortages in LA are leading to some construction delays. Can you just talk about that because I know you're all kind of worried about the supply impact in LA.? I mean is this a scenario were some of that supply maybe gets pushed later this year into next year. Mark Parrell : I think that is what we will see, right. So we saw a shift from \u2013 in 2018 what we were projecting for 2019, we saw a shift occur a lot of the 2018 deliveries got moved into 2019 and it pushed the number up through I think 14,000 units expected in the market. We expect that trend is going to continue. I think in the first quarter we saw about 15% of the expected completed shift and get deferred out. So I guess is, every quarter we are going to keep seeing some of that shift occur. Nicholas Yulico : Okay. Thanks. And just last question on the new data you are giving on new lease and renewal rates. It's helpful. On the new lease numbers, I guess, I\u2019m wondering would those numbers be that much different including concessions. Mark Parrell : No. I guess that would be better right now in New York as we are doing about 50% fewer concessions in the first quarter of 2019 versus 2018. I mean we really don\u2019t do a lot of concessions in the portfolio. And so I look at this and outside of New York, New York would be performing a little bit better than what's on the page. Michael Manelis : Yes. I think new lease concession for us are like $0.50 million or something. I mean, it's just not a material number on $2.6 billion in revenue. Nicholas Yulico : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Stephen Sakwa : Hi. Just a couple of quick questions. I wanted to just talk about the margin opportunity and some of the, I guess tech initiatives that you're sort of doing the self-guided tours and some other things like that. How big or how much of a benefit do you think that could be to margins and sort of over what timeframe do you think we could expect to see that? Mark Parrell : So I think it's probably too early to know the exact impact from all of these initiatives put together. You need to remember that we've done a lot of centralization and eliminated roles onsite in previous years. So for us our opportunity is figuring out how to leverage this technology to create new operating efficiencies. What's probably most exciting for us and we'll probably see the bigger return is that we got an amazing portfolio of assets that are highly concentrated in very desirable locations. So this close proximity when we start thinking about self-guided tours, where we start thinking about kind of potting our kind of onsite folks. We will have less windshield time, which is going to allow us to have greater staff efficiencies in both sales and service. And it's also going to allow us to reduce our reliance on contractors for many of the tasks that are getting completed today. So I think the benefit really comes more like 2020 and 2021, as we start deploying this technology and start to see the compounded impact of all of them coming together. Stephen Sakwa : I guess, how much beta testing have you done on the self-guided tours and what sort of pluses and minuses have sort of come out of that? Mark Parrell : So we've done a lot where we have concierges, right, where you don't need the technology in place. And remember a lot of our buildings we have concierge so we have staff there. We're now just getting ready to deploy the technology in place so you have the locks in place. You can do self-guided tours at properties after hours where you don't have kind of onsite personnel. We've been testing for, I would say probably about nine months. On the smart home technology, we've done probably a little bit over a year. We\u2019ve narrowed it down. We'll have about 2,000 units up and running. On the self-guided tours, we've done this at a handful of properties. We really need to kind of market it better to really see the upside potential of it. But it's big, right because a tour takes 30 minutes of time. So you start eliminating those tours that equals a huge efficiency in your staff. Stephen Sakwa : And just last on the smart home technology. Can you just sort of give us a rough idea of the cost to put all of the things in the home and the sort of the returns that you might expect on that? Mark Parrell : Yes. So I mean that's a tough one. I guess, I'll just throw out an average per door of about $800, but it does swing depending on what kind of lock you're putting in. If you've got a mortise lock, it's more costly than if you just have a standard lock. As far as the return goes, I think we've been out in the industry the $30 a month premium getting charged. On yield management, it's hard to say that that's really a sustainable kind of return that you're getting on that. So I think we need to get more concentration of these in the portfolio to really be able to answer that question to tell you what we expect from it. Michael Manelis : Yes. Steve, I\u2019d add some of this stuff is going to get to be table stakes in some of these markets where people just demand this sort of stuff. So it's really hard to tell what it is and it'll vary a little bit. And some markets will install one thing and some will install another. But it's certainly an opportunity for us to the positive. Stephen Sakwa : Okay. And then last question for Mark, maybe just on strategy I mean as you kind of hear about these coastal markets and these rent control initiatives. I know you've tried to move back in the places like Denver and some other markets, do you sort of think about the footprint of the portfolio any differently moving forward? Mark Parrell : Rent control is a risk, just like climate change just like the financial strength of our various municipalities we operate in, Steve that we have to take into account. We've managed that risk very well. New York\u2019s had rent control the entire time we've been in that market. So it's certainly something we're aware of. But again we hope to have these and continue to have really good dialogue with policymakers and hope to have a conversation that really involves more workforce housing, not just regulating prices and ending up with less workforce housing, less housing in general and kind of a worse problem. So do we take it into account? Absolutely. It\u2019s compelling us to move in other markets. The reasons we're not in those other markets and a lot to do with the quality of demand and the type of customer you have and the ability to build in those markets, and the fact that rent control maybe isn't a threat in those markets. I'm not sure offsets the other disadvantages we see. Stephen Sakwa : Okay. Thanks. That's it for me. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. John Pawlowski : Thanks. Just sticking with New York rent control, curious your political contacts there in Albany, what's your base case scenario for what does change on the ground come middle of this year. Mark Parrell : Yes. Thanks, John. That's really hard for us to guess that. There are so many proposals that are active right now. The governor's talked about a number of things, other legislators have talked about a number of things. Just to be honest with you, impossible for me to tell you that we have a good handle on the exact proposal that's likely to be enacted. When something does seem close then we'll have a firm review. John Pawlowski : My pushback is it's getting close and I mean there's hearings this week and I know legislation can change. But there are details being crystallized. So just curious maybe not base case, but is there any risk to your portfolio NOI these next three to five years as you see things playing out today? Mark Parrell : Well, not only does it depend on the category of the change because there are broad \u2013 I don't disagree with you there are broad things being discussed some of which like capital improvement changes aren't particularly relevant to us, but if you change the preferential rent scheme, it depends how you change it. And I've heard so many different variants that it's really hard for me to react and give you a view. I'll tell you that a good portion of our portfolio in New York City isn't rent controlled at all, it's market rate units. Those units maybe benefited from all this additional controls. So I appreciate the desire to get to some underwriting number right now, but until we have more certainty, it's just hard for us to give you that kind of answer. John Pawlowski : That's fair. And then Michael on D.C. and just the supply dynamic across various submarkets, permitting is starting to pick up meaningfully which I won't hit for another few years, but as 2019 and 2020 unfold where are the pockets of oversupply come in and where are the pockets of relief coming for your portfolio? Michael Manelis : So I think really we're looking at this supply kind of concentration on top of us in these submarkets in the district and in Virginia. And really this market is delivered almost 4,000 units a quarter. And we kind of anticipate that to continue. So from a concentration standpoint, I would say, it still sits on us in the district, it still sits on us in the Northern Virginia. We expect that to continue. We're performing better than what we thought despite the supply sitting there. Mark Parrell : I don\u2019t know John was your question only D.C. or was it broader than that, I apologize. John Pawlowski : Sorry, D.C. I know there's a bunch of waterfront revitalization project. And just wondering, because permitting is accelerating, where are the big supply shocks hitting. Not necessary 2019, but beyond this year where the big supply shocks hitting across the metro? Mark Parrell : Well, D.C. is a market that has the ability to deliver rapidly in new areas. I mean again you talk about the waterfront in this Union Market area is certainly going to get a lot of supply as well. So these new areas are terrific in the sense that they're making the district so much more livable, much more dynamic place, there are a lot of reasons for people to live there more reasons than even before, but these areas do draw these new areas. So I'll tell you, it could spring up in a lot of places and I wouldn't be surprised if we're not talking in two years about the amount of supply in Union Market, because of all of the stuff going on there. I also think you can deliver in Arlington pretty easily and you may see a little bit more delivered in and around the concentration around HQ2 at Amazon. So, I exist everywhere. I mean honestly. John Pawlowski : Yes. Thanks so much. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley. Richard Hill : Hey. Good morning guys. Maybe just following up on that question in a broader context, recognize that you're focused on so-called near-term, I want to see how that plays out until you do take any action and guidance. It sounds like New York City is rebounding pretty nicely here, but as you look out over the next two to three years, what markets get you the most bullish in and maybe what markets do you have a little bit of maybe more caution on either because of supply versus demand technical? Mark Parrell : Hey, Rich. It's Mark. So sort of three inputs demand supply and I'll call it other. When you think about the supply picture, it's probably I would say slightly more discouraging in Washington, D.C. and the ability as we just talked about in the prior question and deliver in many submarkets and in brand new submarkets, large amounts of supply in relative short order, makes that market a little more difficult than some of our other markets on the supply side. Most of the other markets have \u2013 I think a little bit more in terms of structural limitations or land limitations on supply. In terms of demand, we like the picture across all the markets New York feels very good. We feel very good about very bullish on New York long-term. I mean the financial services employment sort of headache is over we think. I think that the city has reborn with an emphasis on technology and new media And we see that it costs our resident base and the amount of demand we like New York a lot. We like Boston, a great deal. We're building a big tower there. So we feel terrific. The West Coast markets have done very well. We like the demand picture across the board including in D.C. A lot of our better D.C. numbers are because frankly the supply was there and we knew it would be, but the demand is just terrific. And then other which I define as both the rent control concerns, we've discussed on the call and then just thinking about whether our jurisdictions are investing in their infrastructure. And that point, the D.C. is to be commended because they just got a new package of reforms in place to fund the renovation of the Metro system, which is badly needed and now they have you know funding assured funding from the three governments to do that. So again we see a lot of good things in our markets across the board. And I would say that the picture and supplying in D.C. is just a little bit more challenging than any other markets. Richard Hill : Got it. And one follow-up to that on the demand side. There's obviously been a lot of talk about the aging millennial population. We've been talking about the Gen Z population that\u2019s coming behind that's even bigger. Do you have these thoughts on the millennial and disease propensity to rent versus own and do you expect that they're going to rent more than own or is it too early to tell at this point? Mark Parrell : Well, I've got a couple Gen Z living with me so I speak something to that. I think we continue creation of jobs in dense and dense suburban and urban settings in these cities that we operate in. I don't know why that dynamic changes. I don't know why people don't want to live there like I can't see what that inflection point would be again provided these cities continue to invest in this attractive infrastructure of parks and transit and the like. So, I mean we're very optimistic. I'd point out that our average resident is a little bit older at 33. So, we haven't even seen the height of the millennials yet through our system. I think the biggest core. It might be 28 years older, so now, so we're going to continue to feel good tailwinds from the millennials, and no reason to believe that the Gen Z wouldn't act similarly. But they are just entering college when they're just coming out of this is a young group yet and I guess to be fair, we haven't really seen their preferences in housing expressed very well yet. Richard Hill : Got it. Okay. That's very helpful guys. Thank you. Congrats on a good quarter. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Thank you. Michael gave some pretty interesting data on foot traffic by market. I'm wondering if you found this to be a good indicator of new lease growth rates historically. And then specifically to New York, what is driving the 7% increase, do you think? Is it broad based or is it specific to some of your submarkets? Mark Parrell : No. So, I would say it was pretty consistent across the submarkets just the being strong. I think foot traffic by itself is not the only thing you would look to see demand, because there's things that we could do based on how many available units we have to sell how much advertising dollars we're putting in there that can influence those numbers. I think for us we were fairly consistent in our marketing strategy and you can see these areas that had the kind of strongest growth on a year-over-year basis allowed us to kind of get in a position where we can grow occupancy versus the prior year and then start pushing right, a leading indicator. John Kim : Okay, a couple of questions maybe for Bob. Was your same-store revenue this quarter or this year will there be any benefit from the accounting change as far as unelectable least revenue being moved up to revenue. Robert Garechana : Yes. So there's no change. We've always accounted for our bad debt expense as a contrary avenue. So, the lease accounting implementation didn't impact the income statement in any regard. John Kim : Okay. And then looking at your second quarter guidance, this is more like the area in FFO not the normalized, but the narrowed FFO is coming down the second quarter versus first quarter. Is there any one-time items or debt extinguishment cost like respecting the second quarter? Robert Garechana : Yes. There's one debt extinguishment costs, which is fairly sizable. Its non-cash, it actually relate to the payoff of some tax exempt bonds on the sale of 806. We acquired that property as part of our stones so that that was mark-to-market. So there is a fairly sizable discount that had to be written off when we paid off that debt in conjunction with the sale. John Kim : And then finally, I know it sounds like revenue is going to come out at the high end of your guidance for the year, expenses have also come in at high-end of your guidance range in the first quarter. Do you expect that to continue for the remainder of the year? Robert Garechana : Yes. So we're comfortable with the kind of call at the midpoint of our guidance range on expenses. We always assumed that the expense growth would be front end loaded in our original forecast. So we're comfortable kind of where the range that's kind of around the midpoint right. John Kim : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Robert Stevenson : Good morning guys. Turnover was down pretty meaningfully again year-over-year. Anything in particular driving the continued decline overall and how much of an impact is that having on an NOI versus 100 or 200 or 300 basis points higher? Robert Garechana : So yes, I mean it was 9.9% for the quarter, it was roughly just over 600 fewer units turned over in Q1 of 2019, over Q1 of 2018. So from an NOI perspective, I mean the cost \u2013 the actual physical cost to make ready a unit is not significant. So I don't think that's a big driver to the NOI. The benefit for us is we reduce our vacancy loss on those units. And we also right now you have more people renewing right and renewals were coming in at a 4.9%. So that to me is a lift that we're seeing kind of into the NOI contribution from that. Of the drivers to that, I think is very consistent to what we've said in the past, which is we are delivering strong customer service to our residents. Our satisfaction scores are at the all time company high. And that's being fueled with people out there deferring life changing decisions for later years and marrying later having children later. So, I think we're benefiting from all of those things coming together. How much lower it goes. I don't know. Robert Stevenson : Okay. Orange County was the one exception was up. Anything that sticks out about that market or is it just noise at this point. Mark Parrell : Yes, it was up and it equated to 27 more move outs during that first quarter versus the first quarter of last year. It's something that we're watching right. We knew we were facing some pressure into that market. We forecasted that in our guidance but it was down and it's something we just need to walk. Robert Stevenson : Okay. And then San Francisco and L.A. had positive new lease growth in the first quarter as per your new schedule. What markets, I assume that those markets are likely to have positive rent growth for the full-year. What other markets besides those two could flip and be positive for the entire year. When you when all is said and done on a new lease basis? Mark Parrell : Yes. So we've put the guidance out there for in the March Investor Presentation for the full-year. So you kind of get a sense. I will tell you sitting here right now. San Francisco, New York and D.C. are probably the three that have really outperformed the first quarter from a new lease change perspective and I think you could just look at the March guidance and kind of understand that would impact those full-year numbers, the rest of this stuff. Its call it 20 basis points, 30 basis points better than what we expected in the quarter. And when you stretch that out over the full-year and you put in all of the quantity of new leases that we're getting ready to write, it's just not as meaningful. Robert Stevenson : Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Guinee with Stifel. John Guinee : Great. Thank you. A few quick questions, first is the $800 new unit digital and digital experience are smart tech spend included in your 2,600 per unit CapEx guidance. Mark Parrell : Yes. John Guinee : And then second, any\u2026? Mark Parrell : Yes. John Guinee : Okay, great. Then second any change in asking or taking rents in your assets contiguous to Amazon HQ to headquarter location yet? Mark Parrell : No. I think they actually \u2013 they just announced that they're going to start putting some employees in there in June and some temporary office space. To me that HQ2 and I think what we're seeing it's a psychological lift right. It's good for long-term fundamentals for those submarket and I think what you're going to see as the year progresses and more and more jobs you're going to see the demand number go up and you'll probably see pricing power strengthened from that. John Guinee : Okay. And then last Boston tower under development 850,000 per unit refresh our memory as to expected yield and then rents on a per square foot basis needed to hit those yields. Mark Parrell : Right. There with me for a second here. Yes, so the tower where we expect to stabilize that is about a take a little over a 6% yield. The current yield on current rents and current construction costs would be bit over 5%. But just to give you a sense of that. I'm not sure I have here the actual rent I don't have the underwriting for that asset here with me and we could certainly talk through that with you at a later points. John Guinee : Great. Nice job. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Hardik Goel with Zelman. Hardik Goel : Hello? Do you guys hear me? Mark Parrell : Yes, we can. Hardik Goel : Hey thanks, Mark. Thanks for taking my call. I just had a question on some of the comments you made on D.C. and L.A. supply. So we know that D.C. hasn't typically an issue with delays and supply comes on they're pretty healthy clip and at the same time we have markets in California where supply is really difficult even ones that started to kind of deliver on time and what's driving that difference really? How much of that is just people looking at construction costs and having to revise the capital stack versus labor and just if you could add some color and insight into what's going on? Mark Parrell : Sure. Well a couple of different things are going on. One is similar. There are new neighborhood, I mean Downtown L.A. is a new destination of sorts so you see a lot of construction there and there's not as much entrenched opposition. When you go to DC, there's a lot less effective entrenched opposition to these new neighborhoods like again the area by the ballpark and you see very significant amounts of construction. It\u2019s relatively easy to build in Northern Virginia. Maryland is a little more difficult, but it is relatively easy. So I would say to you that generally speaking in terms of governmental restrictions land availability in D.C. of a good sized subcontractor base all of that is easier. I would say to execute on in D.C. than it is on the West Coast, we have maybe more limitations in terms of local government rules and regulations you need to work through. We have more significant land limitations, maybe a more effective NIMBYs view on additional units. So I think it's a combination of all those things. Hardik Goel : What about just to the quick follow up. What about wants to use already approved and started. Is there a difference in how long it takes to just complete the unit and get it done on time? Does the regulatory environment affect that as well you think? Mark Parrell : I don't. I've not heard that to be the case, it's more what you're building a high rise or you're building a mid rise wrap product, you're building garden what are you constructing. So if you're building a high rise it's going to take longer. And so a lot of our supply numbers, we think they're pretty accurate when we have markets like New York where everything's high rise and when markets like D.C. where there's a lot of garden, a lot of mid rise it takes less time. So, I have not heard that there's a material difference once construction starts, in say the completion of a mid rise in the L.A. area and the completion of the mid rise in D.C. If there is it's probably whether related or those sorts of things, but I've not heard a great deal of difference. Hardik Goel : Got it. That's very helpful thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning. Mark, just going to New York for a minute, you mentioned that the majority that most of your New York assets were market rate not rent control but could you just maybe on a percentage basis, your New York portfolio that's either for 21 a or you know pre 1974 Brent rent stabilized units. What percent of your New York portfolio would fall into either bucket? Mark Parrell : Sure Alex, I give some general numbers and I'll admit that this is all very technical, it's a little bit subject to correction here as we some of these properties are shifting for example, they're completing their rent stabilization period and they'll move in the market rate. So, we have 9,500 units in metro New York, call it 3,500 or so aren't even in New York City proper. So, they're not part of this conversation we're having right now, call it 30,300 units and that number is going down shortly because we have some deals moving out of the rent stabilization category, so maybe 30,300 units or so, our rent stabilized in one fashion or another. You know as a New York or there's a lot of variations on what that means and whether those restrictions are very significant or less so but effectively 30.300 and the remaining call is 3,000 odd units. Robert Garechana : Our market rate units, and the number of market rate units from now to call at 23 is going to keep increasing as we burn through some of these rent stabilization periods and its 421A assets go through their cycle. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. So just to clarify the 3,300 includes units that are subject to preferential rate rents, the legal caps as well as the rent stabilized units correct? Mark Parrell : Yes. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then second question is I don't think I've heard you guys talk about the new energy initiatives that were just passed in New York, but maybe if you could just talk about I know they're recent but how you view your portfolio is measuring up against towards the city council in the mayor assigned both on the 2024 mandate and then the 2029. And then just reading the way it looks is that buildings with regulated units are exempt, but the market rate units \u2013 market rate buildings are not. So maybe you could just talk about sort of how your portfolio lays up again against for 2024 in the 2029 threshold? Mark Parrell : Sure. So, let me just get a little bit of context. So really the bill is trying to measure those greenhouse gas intensity. They've come out with a calculation that has kind of a mandate for 2024 and then another decline really beginning in 2030 I believe. So, I think just looking at the portfolio and thinking about where we have properties rolling off kind of the 421A that won't be subject to this stuff we're anticipating about 4,500 units or about 70% of our Manhattan and Brooklyn unit. In 2024 we will only need to take prescriptive measures as they will still be subject to some form of kind of rent stabilization. So that being said, I would say the company we've always been focused on energy consumption and efficiency. So we're not \u2013 we're still working through with a consultant to understand our baseline but we're not as concerned about this 2024 requirement. But it looks like it's about a 40% reduction in their calc as to where this benchmark is for 2030. And I would say that reduction is going to take some work to achieve, but we're just we're up for the challenge but we're not really sure yet how much work we're going to have to do to be able to hit that benchmark. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. But basically for the initial part 70% of your portfolio is effectively shielded because... Mark Parrell : Yes. I mean, but you still need to take prescriptive measures in there. So yes, you're shielded from the actual calculation or the penalties from it but there are still things you're going to need to do. But we have a lot of confidence just given our focus over these years that we've already done most of those. Robert Garechana : Yes, we've got a lot of cogent that we do in New York we've got a lot of \u2013 with the sustainability and efficiency initiatives we've done a lot of work on these assets already that you know is gone well for us. You'll see us do some work. A lot of that Alex, I bet you we would have done anyway. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Thank you, Mark. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. John Pawlowski : Thanks. One quick follow-up on the New York City disposition. The 4.4 disposition yield, could you share the like the sellers cap rate what the impact from burn offs of 421A would be on a cap rate basis? Mark Parrell : Yes. We try to based on what the sellers or buyer pardon me is willing to tell us John. Understand what their cap rate is. We think it's about the same as ours initially that there might be you know about the same thought process. Again, we all know what the renovation thought process is. So I don't know \u2013 I don't have right now with me the step up schedule for that specific asset. We certainly could have that conversation with you later. Bob, you got any detail on that specific asset? Robert Garechana : Yes. The only thing I can say is as it relates to our own kind of rate of growth from 2018 to 2019, it was about $900,000 was the step up from the real estate tax piece, but that's all the color I have at the moment. John Pawlowski : Okay. That helps. Thanks. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn it back to our presenters for closing remarks. Mark Parrell : All right. Before we end the call, I want to give a very special thank you to John Lennox, our Senior VP of Financial Planning and Analysis who is retiring today after 35 years with our Company. John has been a valued friend, colleague and teacher to so many of us in our Company and a mentor to both me and Bob Garechana as CFO's. We wish him the very best in his retirement. So thank you all for your time today and have a good day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Please go ahead. Marty McKenna : Thank you, Eduardo. Good morning and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's second quarter 2019 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now I'll turn the call over to Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Thank you, Marty. Good morning and thanks for joining us today. It is a good time to be in the apartment business. Very strong demand for our product has continued to drive absorption in new supply and our turnover continues to be at all-time lows, resulting in same-store revenue growth that is exceeding our expectations and leading us to increase our same-store revenue, net operating income and normalized FFO per share guidance. The midpoints of all these new guidance ranges now exceed the top end of our original guidance expectations. After I discuss our investment activity in the quarter, I'll turn the call over to Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer, to give you color on our operating performance; and then to Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer, to give you some detail on our normalized FFO and same-store expense guidance changes and our balance sheet, and after that, we'll open it up to your questions. On the investment front, asset prices have remained generally stable in our markets, but there are more assets for sale than earlier this year, just giving us the opportunity to trade-in assets that we believe have more desirable long-term return prospects. We continue to see good demand for the assets that we wish to sell. This is often coming from buyers with a value-add thought process. As a result, we have increased our transaction guidance for the year to $1 billion of both dispositions and acquisitions. And during the second quarter we acquired three apartment properties. One was the 366-unit property in Rockville Maryland, built in 2016 that we discussed on the last call. The second is a 312-unit property, built in 2017, located in Castle Rock, which is a suburb of Denver that we bought at a price of approximately $92 million and a stabilized cap rate of 5% and a current cap rate of 4.7%. We are creating a property portfolio in Denver that has both suburban and urban exposure, but we expect that most of the portfolio will consist of assets in the urban core of Denver. The third asset acquired is a 387-unit property in San Jose California that was built in 2017, which was acquired for approximately $180.5 million at a 4.5% cap rate. It is located in South San Jose, across the street from the Caltrain station and within an easy commute of Downtown San Jose and most Silicon Valley employers. During the second quarter, we sold two of our wholly-owned assets, as well as two assets that were in joint ventures. One of the wholly-owned assets we sold was our 806th Avenue property in New York, which we discussed on our first quarter call. As a reminder, 806th Avenue was a rent-stabilized property that is part of the New York 421a program at substantially property tax step-ups for the next several years. The second wholly-owned asset we sold was a 295-unit property in the Longwood Medical Area Boston. We sold this property for approximately $165.3 million at a disposition yield of 4.3%. The Longwood asset is a 1970 asset with dated floor plans and amenities. These sales generated an unlevered IRR of approximately 8.6%. We also sold two properties that we held in a joint venture with an institutional partner. One was in South Florida and one in San Jose California. These totaled 945 apartment units for an aggregate sales price of approximately $394.5 million and a weighted average disposition yield of 4.7%. We received net proceeds of approximately $78.3 million from these sales and the joint venture generated unlevered IRR to us of 24%. After the end of the quarter, we sold an additional property Park at Pentagon Row. It's a 298-unit asset, built in 1990. The sale price was approximately $117 million and we sold it at a disposition yield of 4.5%. The property is located one block from the new Amazon HQ2 location. We took the opportunity to capture the excitement around the HQ2 process to lower our concentration in the area, with the sale of this 30-year-old asset. Now before I hand the call over to Michael, I want to make a comment on rent control. We agree that there's a shortage of workforce in affordable housing in many places in our country, but we disagree that the actions taken in New York and being considered in other states will help solve this problem. The new housing law in New York did not create any incentives to build new affordable housing. In fact, the recent legislation has created disincentives to build new supply at all. We also think that over time it will lead to the deterioration of the existing affordable housing stock. In a moment, Michael Manelis will share our current estimate of the impact of New York's new law on our operating results. While we continue to work through the details of the New York legislation and its impact on our New York portfolio at this point we see the impact limited to caps on renewals for the approximately 3,200 rent-stabilized units in our portfolio as well as new limits on fees. Through our trade associations we will continue to encourage policymakers in California and other states to embrace actions like zoning reform and the removal of other regulatory barriers to new housing construction as well as programs that create incentives for private market developers to build the affordable housing units our city so badly needs. Now I'll hand the call over to Michael Manelis. Michael? Michael Manelis : Thanks Mark. I am pleased to report results from a strong leasing season with continued strength in demand for our product that resulted in acceleration of pricing power, reduced turnover and higher occupancy. All of our markets are doing well, but the East Coast market and Seattle continue to outperform our expectations. Sitting here today our portfolio is 96.7% occupied compared to 96.5% the same week last year. Base rents are up 3.7% as compared to 3.1% the same week last year. Renewal performance continues to be very stable with achieved renewal increases ranging between 5% and 5.2% for the last several months and we expect this trend to continue. Let me provide you some context around the underlying assumptions of our revised guidance range of 3.1% to 3.5%. The new guidance same-store revenue midpoint of 3.3%, which is just above the high end of our original range, assumes that we maintain strong renewal performance around 5% and that we continue to enjoy good new lease rate growth and high occupancy, but both of these moderate as we transition into the seasonally slower part of the year. The 3.3% midpoint of our same-store revenue range assumes occupancy of 96.3% for the back half of the year. This is slightly below our current occupancy due to the seasonal decline I just described but is still 10 basis points above what is a difficult comp period from the prior year. The 3.5% high end of the range is achievable if we do not experience the usual seasonal decline in occupancy later in the year, which is certainly possible given the strong demand that we are seeing but not typical. The bottom end of our range is achieved if occupancy underperforms. So switching gears let me provide you some color by market. Boston clearly benefited from a pause in competitive new supply. We experienced a strong leasing season that delivered 3.25% revenue growth with growth in both occupancy and rate. Our full year revenue growth guidance for this market has increased to 3.5% from 2.8%. The pause in supply is only temporary. Competition will heat back up by the end of the year as a number of large buildings bring their first units to the market in the urban submarkets of Boston and Cambridge where we have almost 70% of our NOI. The good news is that demand is very strong in this market, which will continue to aid the absorption of these deliveries. The New York market continues to demonstrate strength in overall fundamentals with a very strong leasing season. Foot traffic a proxy for demand is up 5.5% versus the same quarter last year and new lease change is up 70 basis points. The last time we posted a second quarter positive new lease change in New York was 2015. Our new lease occupancy and renewal growth were all better than expected. We've revised our full year same-store revenue growth projection for New York to 2.5% from 1.8%. This reflects the overall strong performance of the market, but also includes the impact from changes associated with the rent regulation law that went into effect in the middle of June. Let me start here by reminding everybody that we have approximately 9,600 units in the New York Metro area, one-third of which are not in New York City. Of the approximate 6,500 units that are in New York City about 3,300 are full market-rate and not impacted and about half or 3,200 units are rent-stabilized and are thus impacted by the changes to the regulation. We estimate that these changes will reduce our overall second half renewal rate increase by about 50 basis points which will equate to about a 30 basis points impact on the full year renewal results in New York. The changes in law also impact our ability to charge certain fees at all of our New York properties. We expect an $800,000 annual reduction in fees associated with new restrictions on application and late fees of which $400,000 will impact 2019. Combined these changes to the regulations will reduce our expected New York Metro market revenue performance by approximately 20 basis points in 2019. We will continue to monitor the impact to our portfolio and we will likely find opportunities for savings on the expense side as we look to manage these units under the new laws. Overall, there is good economic activity and strong demand for our products in New York. Companies continue to enter and expand their footprint in the market in order to attract top-tier talent. This top-tier talent wants to live at our high-quality and well-located properties. Washington D.C. is producing better results than we anticipated. We\u2019ve increased our full year revenue growth expectations for this market to 2.6% from our original guidance of 1.4%. Elevated deliveries in the district continue to impact pricing power at our D.C. assets, but overall Class A absorption remains robust. The recent news of what looks to be an agreement on a 2-year federal budget that will raise spending over current spending limits, will support the continued strength in this market. Most of the better than anticipated year-to-date performance is coming from Northern Virginia where we have about 57% of our market NOI. The strength in this submarket is mainly attributable the fact that the overwhelming majority of economic growth in the region is occurring in Northern Virginia as opposed to Maryland and D.C. 94% of all of the jobs created in the Washington region during the first six months of the year were located in Northern Virginia. To share some perspective on the spread between submarkets, the district delivered about 1% growth in the quarter as compared to just under 4% growth in Northern Virginia. Heading over to the West Coast; Seattle, continues to see well-established companies entering the market, as well as existing companies expanding within the market. The market's critical mass of knowledge workers attract these employers and drive strong demand for our products. Foot traffic was up 8.1% on a year-over-year basis which fueled this market's ability to outperform with stronger occupancy and a marked improvement in new lease change. We now expect our full year same-store revenue growth to be 3.2% versus our original expectation of 2% which given our current year-to-date performance of 2.5% demonstrates the current strength in trajectory for the balance of the year. On the supply front, we're getting a break in the CBD and we clearly have pricing power in that submarket. We have some exposure on the East side, where the new deliveries are concentrated right now, but to-date we've seen good leasing velocity and are maintaining both rate and occupancy there. Moving down to San Francisco, San Francisco continues to demonstrate tech-driven economic strength and job growth. At the end of May the Bay Area reached an all-time record high of 835,000 technology-related jobs. We expect the full year same-store revenue growth to be 4% which is 60 basis points higher than our original expectations and consistent with our year-to-date performance. We are seeing the strongest results in San Francisco and the Peninsula with some supply pressure in the East Bay and South Bay submarkets. At present this market is projected to deliver the strongest full year same-store revenue results in our portfolio. Moving down to Los Angeles. Our performance year-to-date includes new lease change and renewal results which were lower than expected being offset by strength in occupancy and growth in other income categories like parking. San Fernando Valley continues to be the submarket that is experiencing the most pressure and is running a little bit behind our original expectation. The rest of the submarkets continue to perform in-line or slightly ahead of our expectations. Our updated full year same-store revenue growth projection of 3.9% is basically unchanged from the beginning of the year. Our full year guidance continues to assume a deceleration due to anticipated pressure from new supply that is back-half loaded. Additionally, the occupancy comp from the second half 2018 in L.A. is challenging which means, we don't expect as much lift from occupancy for the balance of the year. Orange County delivered second quarter results in-line with our expectations. Our full year revenue growth guidance is now 3.6% which was increased based on the lift we received in the first quarter gains and a slight out-performance on occupancy and renewals during this quarter. We have a few properties that are experiencing a lack of pricing power due to deliveries in Irvine and Newport Beach. But overall, our Irvine portfolio is a diverse set of properties and not all of it is going to compete head-to-head with the 2019 supply. San Diego is having a good leasing season, but just not as strong as last year. We expect our full year revenue growth to be 3.4%. This is down from our initial forecast. Overall demand is still good in the market. Occupancy is on track, but we're experiencing a little less pricing power due to the newer product downtown. On the initiatives front, we've had a really busy quarter. We're making great progress toward the sales and service roadmap that we shared in our June investor update. On the sales front by the end of August, we'll have about 50 communities on our artificial intelligence, e-lead platform. We'll have deployed self-guided tours at over 45 communities. On the service side of the business, we began testing our new mobility platform for our service teams and we expect to be fully deployed by the end of the year. We also remain on-track to have approximately 2,500 units enabled with smart home technology within the next 90 days. Let me close with a huge shout out to the employees of Equity Residential. Their focus on delivering remarkable experiences to our prospects and residents is greatly appreciated. They have worked really hard to deliver strong results through what has been a very good leasing season. I will now turn the call over to Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer. Bob Garechana : Thanks Michael and good morning. Michael just discussed our markets and the upward revision to same-store revenue guidance. So let me take a moment to address our same-store expense revision, normalized FFO guidance and touch briefly upon our recent capital markets activity. As you saw in the release, we've reduced the top end of our forecasted full year same-store expense growth range. We now expect same-store expense growth between 3.5% and 4% compared to the 3.5% to 4.5% range, we previously forecasted for the full year. This improvement is driven by better than expected performance in all major expense categories but most notably in real estate taxes. Real estate tax expense which makes up a little over 40% of overall same store expenses grew 3.3% through the first six months of the year. This was significantly lower than our original guidance back in January and is driven by lower-than-anticipated rates in Seattle which we mentioned in our first quarter earnings release, as well as the sale of the 421A asset during the second quarter. This along with continued success in actual and anticipated appeals has reduced our real estate tax expense growth expectation to between 3% and 3.5% for the full year. This improvement is approximately 100 basis points better than original guidance. On-site payroll, our second-largest category also -- performed better year-to-date than we originally anticipated. In order to maintain high levels of customer service, we've increased compensation and benefits to our field personnel in the face of significant competition for their services. With the job -- while this job market has remained competitive, we believe we have adjusted fully to this new compensation marketplace and now expect modestly lower payroll growth versus prior expectations. Like in prior years, we also continue to benefit from fewer losses related to medical claims driven in part by our continued focus on employee wellness. We now expect full year payroll growth of between 3.25% to 3.75% for 2019, also 100 basis points better than originally anticipated. Finally our last two major expense categories are; utilities and repairs and maintenance which each make up around 13% of total same-store expense. Growth in utility expense is expected to remain contained in the mid 2% range for the full year. Repairs and maintenance which was negatively impacted by storms and other weather-related items during the first quarter has normalized during the second quarter. We are not forecasting any additional outsized growth in repairs and maintenance for the remainder of the year and therefore expect a mid-4% range growth rate for the full year 2019. Turning to normalized FFO, as noted in the release, we have meaningfully raised our guidance range for normalized FFO for the full year. Our new guidance range of $3.43 per share to $3.49 per share is up $0.07 at the midpoint, driven by the following items; a $0.04 contribution from same-store NOI based on the strong performance in our core business as highlighted by the new revenue and expense assumptions that Michael and I just outlined; a $0.03 contribution from the timing of our acquisition and disposition activity in both 2018 and 2019, and the minimal to non-existent cap rate dilution from this activity; a $0.01 contribution from lower interest expense due to lower-than-anticipated floating rates along with more favorable refinancing rates offset by $0.01 in other items including corporate overhead. Turning to capital markets, as you saw in our release, we accessed the unsecured markets in June for a very successful issuance of $600 million in 10-year notes. The rate of 3% was one of the lowest 10-year coupons in both EQR and the REIT sector's history. After quarter end, we used the proceeds from the issuance to repay a portion of $950 million in secured and unsecured debt that was maturing in 2019 and 2020. With these payoffs, we've effectively addressed all of our 2019 maturities and about half of 2020. Finally, this new debt was financed at an effective P&L rate that was nearly 75 basis points better than that of the debt that was paid off. Our balance sheet remains incredibly well-positioned for the future given our strong credit metrics and limited near to medium term maturities. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. Eduardo? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Nicholas Joseph from Citi. Please go ahead. Nicholas Joseph : Thanks. Mark, appreciate your comments on New York rental control and Michael's comment on the impact to operating results. I'm wondering if you can talk about what you expect or what you're seeing in the market in terms of the asset pricing maybe both for market rate and rent control assets in New York City specifically. Mark Parrell : I'm sorry Nick could you speak up just a bit. I think your question was on New York rent control and what we're seeing in other markets, but I'm sorry I didn't-- Bob Garechana : Asset pricing. Mark Parrell : Asset pricing. Nicholas Joseph : Yes. So, it's on asset pricing specifically. So, I'm wondering if you've seen any changes to asset pricing in New York City both market control and rent-regulated. And then when you expect to happen going forward given the new rent regulations? Mark Parrell : Yes. Thank you for the question and for repeating it. It's just been six weeks since the new rules have gone into force. So, there really hasn't been a lot of activity that we -- or really any activity that we've seen that's priced assets at a size that we deal with. There was in the paper a reference to a deal that was priced before the rules. I think the buyer was trying to get out of the transaction, but that's a different kind of discussion. So, we have not seen any activity yet either direction. Nicholas Joseph : And then what is your expectation for what this could do to asset prices in New York City? Mark Parrell : Sure. I think it's going to take a little time for the market to just understand the rules. I mean we've got a great team here in Chicago and in New York really pored over that and really feel like we've got a pretty good handle on it, but even we're still learning. So, I'd say it's going to take the market a little while to understand the rules and apply it to what they think the pro forma cash flows are going to be going forward. My expectation rent control in New York has always been there it's come it's gone. It was more acute in the 1880s and it's been less acute lately and now it's going to be a little bit more. So, I think this market is used to having some rent control in their calculation of future cash flows. I think there's going to be a lot less supply built in this market which is bad for the city, in general, but probably good for cap rates and values for -- especially for the 3,000-plus market-rate units we own. So, my expectation is that this will take a little while to sort out, that there will be changes in people's perception not just of revenues, but of expenses. And we -- Michael sort of alluded to that. I think we'll be spending less money on turnover cost because our turnover will be lower, less money on leasing and advertising, because again there'll be less need to fill the buildings so we occupied more -- even more highly than they are right now. So, my expectation is not to see big changes in cap rates. You could potentially see cap rates on market rate deals go down. Nicholas Joseph : Thanks. And then just on updated guidance specific to the $0.03 related to the 2019 and 2018 transaction activity. Can you give more color on what's driving that? Is it the performance of the 2018 deals or is it timing of 2019? I know you changed the spread for guidance for this year, but that seems to only have a minimal impact on guidance. Mark Parrell : Yes. I want to clarify a little bit more on the prior question as well. I -- my answer is limited to kind of the product we own. So, these rent-stabilized properties are relatively new. Some of the older rent-stabilized product might be more significantly impacted. The market-rate and rent-stabilized stuff that's relatively new in vintage that's going through 421A is where I was focusing my comment. So, Bob Garechana and I are going to answer your question on that $0.03 difference. A part of that is just timing. We bought a lot a lot earlier in the year and that created this advantage where we have the disposition assets that will create NOI for us through most of the year. So, as it relates to 2019, which is most of what's going on here, it's really driven by timing. And then of course the fact that we have almost no dilution. So, a few years ago we indicated you a lot more of our trading would be done flat or with very, very little dilution and you're seeing that evidence of this year. Anything you'd add Bob? Bob Garechana : No. I think that sums it up. You'll see that corresponding or offsetting component of that is the slight increase in weighted average debt that you see in our guidance adjustments. And that's really just funding related to that change in timing. But I think Mark hit it on the head. Nicholas Joseph : Thanks. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : All right. We'll take our next question from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Trent Trujillo : Hi, good morning. This is Trent Trujillo on with Nick. So, just to go back to rate growth if you're seeing such strong demand across your markets, how much are you looking to push rates given occupancy is better than expected and turnover is at an all-time low? Michael Manelis : Yes. So, I mean I think we actually moved rate a lot through this leasing season. And the fact that the rents are up call it 60 basis points more than where they were this time last year at 3.7% sitting here, that's actually pretty good growth. My guess is that we're going to see that kind of continue for the tail end of the leasing season. And then I would expect that while we'll moderate for the balance of the year, we just may not moderate quite as much as we've done in the past. So, I don't -- it's hard to understand exactly how much of this gap is going to close between the renewal and new lease, but clearly, I think we're pretty pleased with the results that we posted for the second quarter and like the momentum that we have in place for the third quarter as well on the new lease side. Trent Trujillo : Okay. I guess just a quick follow-up on that. Is it still fair to think about your confidence and your ability for new lease rate growth to narrow to about 150 200 basis points spread to renewals? Michael Manelis : I think over a period of time. Yes, I don't believe that that's going to take place this year. I think the gap was just too wide when we entered the year to express -- to expect them to compress that quickly. But I think over time as you see strong demand and good pricing power, you will see that spread start to narrow back to that range call it between 150 and 200 basis points. Trent Trujillo : Are there any particular markets that you're most enthusiastic about when you look forward? Michael Manelis : Well, yes, I mean I like New York right now with what's happening. I like D.C.'s momentum that we have and Seattle. So, really -- I mean the only market that I would say is kind of that we're putting out there is the buzz or caution really points to Southern California right now where we're just trying to get the pricing power in check to understand for the balance of the year. But I don't think that that spread is going to narrow down in Southern California right now. The other markets I think still have potential to narrow. Trent Trujillo : Okay. One more quick one I'm sorry. But you've spoken -- the team has spoken about the possibility of taking leverage up a little bit in the past. So, how much consideration did you give to recasting guidance showing Equity Residential as a net acquirer this year? Mark Parrell : So, it's Mark, I think that depends on what more opportunities the team sees. If the investment team as we see on the ground are more deals for sale for right now Trent, we see more we like, we certainly are capable either with that $300 million of net cash flow that we've spoken of after payment of our dividend and CapEx every year we have, we can use a good portion of that to buy additional assets. We could certainly borrow more. So, we're open to that possibility. We haven't seen enough good stuff yet to justify taking leverage up, but we're certainly open to it. Trent Trujillo : Okay. Thanks for time. Appreciate the comments. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : We'll now take over the next question from Rich Hightower from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Rich Hightower : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Mark Parrell : Good morning Michael Manelis : Good morning. Rich Hightower : I guess related to the first half performance, could you guys pin down maybe an estimate of where the supply is shifting from the first half to the second half or beyond? How that impacted your ability to push rents during the first half of the year? Michael Manelis : Yeah. So this is Michael. So we really \u2013 this quarter, we're tracking supply in a couple of different ways from completions versus first unit hitting the market. We really did not see in this quarter any variations from what we expected to have take place in the second quarter from first unit hitting the market. I think what we could see as we get into the balance of the year you could see some of the typical markets start to show, the delays in deliveries and start shifting from one year to another. But at least for the second quarter, we kind of hit the markets to exactly what we thought was going to happen to us from a new delivery in the market. So I don't think we benefited from any kind of delays more than what we already anticipated. Rich Hightower : Okay. That's helpful Michael. And then maybe going back to the comments earlier about the impact to overall New York revenue performance of I think you said 20 basis points for 2019. I mean, given what you said about still \u2013 not withstanding the people that have worked on it up until now but kind of still working your way through the law and the implications I mean how much variability around that 20 do you think could be possible whether for the remainder of this year or even into 2020? Michael Manelis : We have a pretty high degree of confidence for the balance of this year that is not going to be materially different than that 20 basis points. We're benefiting a little bit because the law went into effect in the middle of the year. So it's half of the impact and you did a lot of your transactions before the law as well on some of the fee impact. But if this was a January 1, it would be a 40 basis point impact to this market for this year. As we think about next year, the difficulty is really trying to project where are renewal where were renewals going to be, because then you can figure in okay what are these restriction going to mean to you the fact that you can't achieve what would have been otherwise possible. So we still have a little bit more modeling to do and it's early to try to start thinking about 2020. But it's pretty clear, when you look for the balance of this year what the impact is going to be to us. Rich Hightower : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Pawlowski from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. John Pawlowski : Thanks. Michael or Mark just following up on that question, I'm less concerned about 2020, but call it the next three years as you adjust your expense playbook as market demand supply factors adjust. Do you see the new rules as a net negative to EQR's NOI? Is it neutral? Is it a modest positive? How do you think longer term about your operating cash flow in New York? Mark Parrell : Yeah. Thanks for that question, John. I think I'll start by saying, we definitively see it as a net negative for New York and for housing production in New York and for addressing the affordable housing issues that New York has. As it relates to us specifically, because we cannot own some of this older post-World War II rent-stabilized heavily regulated product that got hit the hardest the impact on us is less. I think it also creates uncertainty in the development and lending communities that may evidence itself in there being considerably less supply in New York than the already low numbers that market has. I think I can make an argument that New York has just become the most supply-constrained market that we operate in. So I would suggest to you that we may do modestly better on our market-rate assets than we would have expected on revenue. And I think on expenses, we're going to have an opportunity as we figure out what our new turnover numbers are with these renewal increases. We contract out for a lot of turnover costs and we're going to have lower turnover so those expenses will go down. In terms of capital, we've got to be very thoughtful about where we're putting our capital as well and we will adjust for that. So I \u2013 when you talk about a longer-term impact that's yet to be fully determined. But I think there are modest positives as well as \u2013 especially, to an operator of the kind of assets, we own including the fact that there's just not going to be much built in New York, because of this for quite a while. And if you own market-rate product in every year we're going to get 200 or 300 units more of market-rate product because our 421a rent-stabilized assets will transition as the burn-off period concludes into the market-rate assets, I think that's going to be to us an incremental positive. John Pawlowski : Okay. But operating income for you when you put it all together the pros and cons, is the event of the new regulation in that modest net negative modest net positive? Mark Parrell : I'd say either even or it could be a modest net positive, just because of the shift from rent-stabilized to market rate for us over time and the impact on supply in the market. But I can't emphasize enough how awful this is for the New York and as a housing policy matter. John Pawlowski : Sure. Okay. And then a question \u2013 I know it's just one disposition, but a question about your broader exposure to D.C. I mean, it finally does seem like an improving market and there is job growth drivers to like more than we liked two years ago. So I guess why prune in D.C.? Mark Parrell : Well, we've got some assets that are a little bit older in D.C. and we've got a big concentration in Crystal City around the HQ2 property. So that \u2013 for us, this was simply an opportunity to get rid of some older assets, I would say that in D.C. what's most exciting to us isn't just HQ2 it's Virginia Tech's new technology kind of Harper [ph] technology campus they're building, and the kind of jobs you're going to get in the district in and around the areas. So they won't be just sort of government-dependent, but there will also be a big technology \u2013 private market technology aspect there. So that's exciting to us. The supply, the continuation of relatively high supply numbers in D.C. which we do expect will go on is a net negative to the market. So for us as we look at D.C. having a modestly lower exposure to that supply makes sense to us, but we'll continue to buy and build assets in that market to try and freshen the portfolio. But seeing modestly less exposure to that market given the supply considerations I just discussed. And the fact that this is the first time, I think we've talked positively about D.C. in four-plus years for us that \u2013 it seems like a sensible approach. John Pawlowski : Okay. Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : All right. We'll now take the next question from Shirley Wu from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Shirley Wu : Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. So Michael, I did want to follow-up with your earlier remarks on L.A. So new leases year-to-date are trending at call it around 0.4% versus your initial guidance of 1.4%. And you mentioned that would continue to accelerate in the back half of supply and occupancy would get more challenging as well. So I'm just curious as to the color around you maintaining your revenue guidance for that market. Is that coming from let's say other income? Michael Manelis : Yeah. So and I think I said in the prepared remarks, we outperformed a little bit in the first half of the year with occupancy so that was a boost to the number. And we definitely had other income, primarily parking that contributed to a little bit on the outperformance or mitigated the downside from the underperformance on new lease change and renewable. There is something on the new lease change that, I guess, I can call out, which is the one you drew the comparison of a 0.4% to our full year new lease change, but you got to remember, there's a lot of seasonality to that metric by quarter, so you need to understand what \u2013 where was that relative to last year. So last year, we were running at a 2.3% new lease change in L.A. compared to the 40 basis points positive. A lot of that impact had to do with the fact that there is some anti-gouging proclamations that were put in place, and those proclamations really restricted our ability to obtain short-term lease premium in the market during the second quarter. So last year, we sold about 15% of all of our leases as short-term leases and those leases typically add premium call it anywhere between 15% and 30% higher than a standard 12-month lease. With the proclamation that was put in place that limits your ability to have growth greater than 10%. We chose not to sell short-term premiums, because the premium wasn't going to be enough for us to have those leases in place. So that's a lot of the dilution that you're seeing in the quarter numbers right now. Shirley Wu : Got it. That's good color. I just had a second question for you guys on WhyHotel. Could you talk to your experience with WhyHotel at 100K in D.C.? Maybe some of the things you've learned from that experience? And if you would consider using their platform with any of your projects currently under development? Mark Parrell : Sure, it's Mark. Yeah, we had a very good experience with WhyHotel. We know that we were sort of first out of the gate working with them the bigger public companies and others are considering or planning to do things with them. So we had a good experience. And I think it's a great way to mitigate that lack of income on the lease-up of a project and we'd consider using them again. Shirley Wu : All right. Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : All right. We'll take our next question from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. John Kim : Thank you. From recollection of a couple of years ago, when the market was softer, you guys were signing more two-year leases with the second year essentially flat. And I'm wondering what that dynamic is now? How many two-year leases are you signing? And what's the embedded growth in that second year? Michael Manelis : So I don't have that with me. I will tell you, we looked at that specifically in New York, where we did do a lot of two-year leases several years ago. It's something that's common in the marketplace. We actually had increased turnover in New York this quarter and on a year-to-date basis. And a lot of that increase was due to the fact that we had two-year leases expiring and we were not selling quite as many two-year leases going forward. So we're seeing it drop down, but I just don't have the stats in front of me to quantify. Mark Parrell : Yes. It's not terribly material. I mean, you have to offer two-year leases in New York statutorily, but we don't have a lot of two-year leases not -- frankly non-12-month leases on the portfolio. John Kim : So outside of New York, that dynamic doesn't exist? Mark Parrell : No. Michael Manelis : No. Mark Parrell : It's uncommon. Michael Manelis : Yes. Very limited. John Kim : Michael, in your prepared remarks you discussed the bifurcation between Northern Virginia and the rest of D.C. Metro. Do you see this as a longer-term trend given HQ2 and the other tech companies growing in the market, or do these submarkets tend to revert back to the norm? Michael Manelis : Well, I think, a lot of that too is just the pressure on supply in the district could mitigate some of that future revenue growth. No, I think, Northern Virginia has got a lot of good things working in its favor to demonstrate strong revenue growth for the future. And I think, there will be some spillover into the district in the other areas, but probably not at the same pace. John Kim : Great. Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : All right. We'll now take the next question from Drew Babin from Baird. Pleas go ahead. Drew Babin : Hey. Good morning. I was hoping to hit on the\u2026 Mark Parrell : Good morning, Drew. Drew Babin : Good morning. The moving parts of the expense guidance change, kind of, what's implied for the second half of this year? I was hoping you could talk a little bit just based on the visibility you have, with the cadence of expense growth in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter from an ease-of-comps perspective, and also anything that might kind of be lumpy that's in there? Bob Garechana : Yes. It's Bob Garechana, so I'll take that real quick. So for year-to-date, we've produced 3.9% growth and we're guiding at the midpoint to 3% and 3.25%. I cautioned on all expense growth that $750,000 equals 10 basis points, so it can be volatile. But at the moment we don't anything. We expect the back half to be the slightly better than the front half. A lot of that is due to expectations that in the fourth quarter we won't see any anomalies like we saw in first quarter related to repairs and maintenance. But otherwise things are pretty much in line for the back half relative to the front half. Drew Babin : Okay. That's helpful. And one more question that's maybe a little more conceptual. A lot of our third-party research that we've read suggest that cap rates in secondary locations, B-class properties, have converged quite on urban A cap rates, so there's still some spread, but it's historically very narrow. Does EQR look at this and think that, maybe it's time to double down or maybe even look at issuing common equity at some valuation to kind of double down on urban A-type properties, with this better long-term growth prospects, or do you look at that data and say maybe this is just a rational pricing on the B and secondary product? We'll just still continue to do what we've been doing. Mark Parrell : Yes. I think we do think about continuing to do what we're doing. I mean, I think you hit the nail on head in terms of where the value is. The fact that there's been this convergence is mostly as a result, in our opinion, of some of these secondary markets being overvalued, because they're just a higher yield. They're just a slightly higher yield. They're more suitable for leverage. And there's just a lot of money chasing apartment products. And if there's any way you can talk yourself into something being mid-5 cap rate, you're going to do it. So you've got a lot of money hitting markets and doing things that we think are going to be difficult. Because a lot of these secondary markets aren't feeling the housing -- single-family housing pressure right now; that they're probably going to feel at different points in the cycle and we don't think we're going to feel that on the urban end. So we continue to look at the suburbs in our markets too true, like, the dense parts of our suburbs, like the Rockville deal you saw us do. So you'll see us buy suburban product where we see the customer base the same as our urban product. But to use the ATM to go hit that really hard at this point, it does not seem like that opportunity is as of yet so compelling, but we'll keep our eyes open. Drew Babin : Great. Appreciate the color. Thanks. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take the next question from Richard Hill from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ronald Kamdem : Hey, you've got Ronald Kamdem on the line. Just two quick ones for me. The first is just on sort of show of the technology. Where are you guys in terms of getting maybe smart lock and smart home technology? And in terms of just, on the operating side, what sort of opportunity is there to sort of reduce either overhead or manpower through technology? And curious if it's millions, tens of million, how you guys think about that? Michael Manelis : Yes. So this is Michael. So I opened in some of the prepared remarks just around some of the stats that the things that we were doing on the initiatives front. So we're on track. We'll have about 2,500 units with smart home technology in the next 90 days. We've got about 50 of our properties up and running with both kind of artificial intelligence, e-lead platform and self-guided tours. We got mobility on the service side. I think \u2013 and I stated this last quarter and we talked a little bit about this at NAREIT which is, from our standpoint on these initiatives, the focus has really been around transparency, control, convenience and flexibility to our customers. We've done a lot of de-centralization and eliminated roles on-site in prior years. We're not saying that we're not done, but I know that we're going to need to see the technology platforms enabled through our portfolio, just to see and understand what efficiencies and opportunities we're going to create. So we're excited about the momentum that we have in place and I think as we get closer towards the end of the year, we'll be able to put some numbers to it. I mean each one of these right now were in these initial pilot phases. But I can point to on a standalone basis, we'd look at like the mobility platform, we have initial expectations that is worth a couple of million dollars to us, could be worth more from reduction in dependence on third-party contractors and overtime and things like that. So, but we want to see these up and running for a little bit. We want to make sure that the results that we see are sustainable over a long period of time before we start putting numbers into the results for you guys. Mark Parrell : And it will take a while in any event to evidence itself. I mean, 2019 is about implementation and putting these things out there. And 2020 and thereafter is more about seeing results. And some of the stuff will work great and some of this stuff won't and we'll be very open in both direction. And we'll use the entire 80,000-unit platform to leverage any technology that we do like. Ronald Kamdem : Great. My second question just -- I love to talk a little bit about affordability, maybe as you think about your markets East Coast, West Coast sort of how that's trended and what you think the outlook of that is for the next three to five years? Mark Parrell : Sure. So you did ask about markets, but I want to talk about company first a little bit on affordability. We have -- our residents -- our average household customer income is $155,000 a year. They're paying us $2,800 a month in rent which means they're giving us about 19% of their income in rent. So our customer, just specifically the Equity customer is not terribly distressed. They've done well, they've gotten raises. We see that in the statistics that we have. So we talked about affordability of the rent check they're paying equity now, we feel really good about that. We do recognize the bigger affordable issue in our markets that I think on the workforce side is pretty common. We think that a lot of the things being done for example in Minneapolis and were done in part in Seattle that were done with the old 421A program in New York, where you encourage and incentivize developers to create both more market-rate and affordable housing, where you reduce zoning barriers. I think this -- the answer is housing production to address this affordability issue you're bringing up. And for that to occur, the government's got to both I think, encourage private industry to work as an actor to create these units and I think to some extent get out of the way on some of the things that it does that create barriers to that. So again there's a great article on Minneapolis that came out just today, I think talking about their new zoning system that effectively got rid of single-family housing zoning in Minneapolis and it's likely to encourage a lot more production of housing. Ronald Kamdem : Great. If I could just follow up on that, if I may? Just trying to get a sense of -- obviously you've been in the industry for a long time, as these conversations are coming up over production of housing and sort of you mentioned, do you feel like the conversation are maybe more productive today than they -- with regulators then maybe they were three or five years ago, or do you still feel like there's still a little bit of education or hill to climb? Just trying to get a sense of the tealeaves? Thanks. Mark Parrell : There are still things we need to do with the policymakers. We're pretty active through our trade associations having these conversations. A lot of rent control to us is a bit of well-intentioned, but misguided attempt, so just relieve these rent pressures on people. But it's not going to help in the long run. So to answer your question directly, I think the industry needs to continue to push on the education front both with policymakers and with the public. And cities like Sydney, Australia and Toronto repealed rent control a few years ago and they're seeing in Toronto lower rent growth than they did before, now that they've repealed it. In Sydney, Australia they're seeing rents actually go down on high-quality and workforce housing because they've produced so much housing. So it isn't like the industry doesn't have facts to back up its position. There are very few, if any economists that tent rent control is a good idea. So I think we just need to keep -- putting your message out there. There's tough cycles and there will be a time when they sort of stop doing this and get rid of it like they did in the early '90s, when all these preemption measures came across all the states that didn't allow localities to do rent control and when New York started to liberalize its rules. Ronald Kamdem : Helpful. Thanks so much. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Great. We'll now take our next question from John Guinee from Stifel. Please go ahead. John Guinee : Great. Just a couple of balance sheet questions. You sold out your unconsolidated JVs, but you still have $52.9 million of unconsolidated entities on the balance sheet. What does that refer to? And then second -- and if this information is somewhere else let me know, you $281 million of lease liabilities are those ground lease obligations? Bob Garechana : Yes. It's Bob Garechana. I'll take the second question first and then talk about the investment on consolidated. The ground, the ROU or the liability and the ROU on the balance sheet are predominantly related to ground leases. So we have 14 ground leases, but there are also corporate leases etcetera. I think in the Q we probably do a very specific job or kind of outlining that they are predominantly ground leases. On the investment and unconsolidated, there are some non -- there are some unconsolidated investments. There is a predominant -- $40 million of that $52-odd million is related to a unconsolidated condo kind of joint investment structure related to one asset that we own that is there as well as our private equity technology investments that we disclosed previously and that makes up the balance of that $52 million. But there are no true operating assets that are unconsolidated anymore post the sale of the two that we mentioned in the release this quarter. John Guinee : Okay. And then are you also -- are you providing any information anymore on your consolidated joint venture? I think maybe you have a partner who has a 20% interest in that? Mark Parrell : Well that -- those were the two that were sold this quarter. So that's gone away. Bob Garechana : Those are the unconsolidated. So the other piece we have is -- which I think is also in the Q there some, we do have some consolidated ventures that have minority interest in them. There is, I think, 17-odd properties or so that have limited partnerships that we refer to as group B stuff. There is another asset that is in the D.C. market that is -- got a 25% minority interest. There is some disclosure in the Q and in the K related to that. John Guinee : Great. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Rich Anderson from SMBC. Please go ahead. Rich Anderson : Hey, thanks. Good morning. As part of the education process with regard to New York rent control, the ability for existing stabilized units to graduate to market and if that -- is that perhaps like a -- sort of an unintended impact to all this? And could that actually help you again given that you have a lot of market rate in New York? Mark Parrell : I may not have followed your question exactly. Is it that we need to educate policymakers or continue the conversation about the conversion in market rate not that... Rich Anderson : Yes I'm sorry will that process be impacted by all this in a way that it's not understood quite yet? Mark Parrell : Yes. I think there are probably a significant number and in the prior question on this I probably hit on it. There's a significant things we don't understand and unintended consequences the policymakers have triggered. So they're going to -- they have to figure some of those things out. I think, again, they have created disincentives to certain types of conduct like investing in some of this post-World War II product that is I think the backbone of New York's workforce housing supply. So I think there is this conversion part they may not fully understand and they just may be very happy not to have those rental rates go up. But they've also done is discourage people from putting money into those deals. Rich Anderson : Right Mark Parrell : So that's going to have that impact on deterioration. So there's probably more to come here I would think over time in terms of once they start to see this negative impact hopefully the policymakers react to that and change some of the rules. Rich Anderson : And how would you compare and contrast what's going on in New York with what may or may not happen again in California Costa-Hawkins part 2? I mean would you say that that's a little bit more of a fluid situation from your perspective, just curious how you're approaching that. Mark Parrell : Yes. Thanks, Rich. I think the good news in California is that the dialogue is much more public. So the activists of the industry have a seat at the table they're talking to policymakers there's a lot of back-and-forth. We all know about the Assembly Bill AB-1482 that has cleared the assembly. And once the senate comes back from recess in a couple of weeks will be discussed there and we think that that is again not the right direction to go but at least we are involved in the conversation again as our activists in the public in general. What happened in New York seemed to happen in dark of night. And I think it's going to have a lot more unintended consequence because it wasn't carefully vetted and thought through. And so I can't speculate as to how California will end up, but the quality of the conversation so far to us seems pretty good. Rich Anderson : Okay. Last question. You mentioned dense suburbs and looking in that direction. Do you feel like there's a lot of talk about how the suburbs have outperformed urban core up to this point. Maybe you don't see it that way but a lot of people have said that. Do you feel like EQR has left some money at least temporarily on the table by virtue of the fact that you have this sort of urban-centric model? Mark Parrell : Well, coming out of the Great Recession we're leaders with the urban portfolio. The demand we see and the resiliency of that demand we think what happened in the suburbs and the positives was mostly about just the dearth of supply. And when you do see supply and Michael Manelis has spoken to this and for example the San Fernando Valley, not a lot of important drivers there. Now we've got a bunch of supply and we're having a tough time at it. Whenever we see supply fall on to a suburban submarket, we see a lot more dire consequences where these urban submarkets just work through it because the more that's built in these urban submarkets the more appealing those areas become. And so they draw in even more people and it serve this virtuous circle and that would hurt us for a while in our numbers. In the long run, we're in a lot of these properties at a very low basis on a relative scale compared to what people bill to, and it's a \u2013 we feel like in the long run our NAV growth and our IRR and our FFO growth will be better. So I think our emphasis on the dense suburbs is just more a bit of a slight shift. I mean, we're looking for the same kinds of customers so the guys we usually use the folks that usually are in our units in D.C have $120,000 household income numbers per year and the folks in Rockville they average about $110,000. These are the exact same customers they just drive to work, because of the nature of that location as opposed to take transit. So we want to find more people like that Rich. We think those areas are good investments. But just to be in far suburbs hoping there will be no supply, the minute there is some supply your product is obsolete and you struggle for a long time. Rich Anderson : Okay. Great color. Thanks very much. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : All right. We'll now take question from Hardik Goel from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead. Hardik Goel : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Not to beat the dead horse, but this New York regulation theme that I think I understand the moving pieces please correct me, if I'm mistaken. Of the assets that are currently stabilized, can you tell us how many of those are actually under the 421a development plan and will at some point become market-rate units? And maybe a little bit on the cadence of when you would expect to see them become market-rate units since I know the structure is going to be quite different. Mark Parrell : Yeah. I think it's effectively all of them. Thank you for that question. And it's \u2013 one way to think about this is from now till 2028, so it's a long period of time somewhere between 150 and 300 units a year and that's because it's chunky, because it's properties. So we have a property that in the last few weeks moved into this category. We leave the rent-stabilized world and enter the market-rate world. There are transitional rules, it doesn't all happen in a day in terms of the change in our ability to grow revenue at that property, but it happens. And so I think that's \u2013 again a built-in advantage of the kind of owning the kind of assets that we own in these markets that these sort of properties are in the market that's going to have even less supply, we're going to have more market-rate units created with no incremental developmental risk every year for the next nine or so years. Hardik Goel : Got it. Thank you. That's really helpful. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : All right. We'll take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good morning. Good morning in Chicago. Just two questions, first just continuing on the 421a theme, what are your thoughts on keeping \u2013 for a while you guys have been selling your 421a especially to avoid the increased real estate taxes as abatement burns off. And saw on a local publication you guys are marketing Ten23 which I think is a 421a. But what are your thoughts on retaining the remaining 421a assets and accept the higher real estate burn-off pressure on OpEx for the advantage of owning those market-rate units longer term? Which Mark I agree with you they're going to be vastly more valuable given that housing stock in New York is going to go down and those units are going to be more in demand. So what are your thoughts on keeping remaining 421a versus this selling that you've been doing? Mark Parrell : Yeah. Thanks for that question, Alex. So I'm not going to comment on any specific asset. But I think you'll see us continue to sell a few of these 421a assets that have just begun their burn-off period. That are 6, 8, 10 years from entering and sometimes even longer. It isn't always true that the end of the tax abatement period is the end of the affordable housing period. So that's an important thing to keep in mind. For us everything, I've told you is the case, but assets we've sold lately some of them at the abatement end and their requirements to see affordable go another 10 years or more. So we are going to be thoughtful about this. We have assets where we think cash flow growth over the next 6 to 10 years is almost certainly negative. It's going to be very hard for us to hang on to those assets taking a 10-plus year's from now there's a payday. But asset that are anywhere near their expiry date I agree with you those assets have probably a special and different value, and those are probably assets we're even more interested in holding onto than we have been before. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And have you guys \u2013 I know, it's early on, but given that asset values are going to be negatively impacted by the regulated units presumably your tax assessment pushback is going to grow. Do you see this as a potential significant savings of reduced real-estate taxes because of the value of the buildings has gone down? Mark Parrell : Yeah. Well, I'm not sure the values of the buildings are going down or not. Like I said earlier, we're just not sure about that. But we intend to be more aggressive. And absolutely you show your income and expenses for the accessory have these discussions Michael is a pro at this. He has a team that works with the investment group that does this for us and we're all over it. So you can be assured that we'll be on top of any appeal opportunities this presents. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then just finally, bigger picture on the back half of this year, it almost sounded like when you're talking about more supply coming in Boston the negative headwinds on lower New York revenue growth and it sounded like there were few other markets in there which may have some supply. It sounds like there is some increasing pressure in the back half yet your guidance increase obviously suggests that things are pretty healthy. So, did I mishear or are there few markets that are going to be some headwinds in the second half of this year? Michael Manelis : No, I think that's absolutely correct. I mean I'll just point L.A. L.A. is a very pronounced back-half loaded on the delivery side. But I think what you've got to remember as that pressure starts to come in towards the later part of Q3 and Q4, the volume of transactions less the impact on the full year revenue numbers is less because you're only being impacted for that stub period for the balance of the year. But supply definitely in several of the markets is back-half loaded and we are just going to see if demand stays strong, it's going to be absorbed and we'll be just fine and if demand softens a little bit, it's just going to basically play into our next year's forecast and what's going to happen to our embedded growth next year. Mark Parrell : Yes. That the important point the embedded growth as Michael and I have been talking over the last few weeks. We're going to roll into 2020 and we are not given guidance on the call, but it is important because your question is forward-looking. We're going to have much better embedded growth likely going into next year, but tougher occupancy comps. Some of the supply pictures for some of these markets like New York and L.A. will be better in 2020 that it is even in 2019 and a lot of the others will be about constant. So, we feel terrific about the back half of the year, the usual seasonal variability is going to occur. But there isn't some like particular risk that's coming in. I mean you're going to have -- we could easily end up at the top end of the range if occupancy just doesn't moderate and that's happened as recently as last year. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : All right. We'll now take our last question from Nicholas Joseph from Citi. Michael Bilerman : Hey, Mark, it's Michael Bilerman here with Nick. I recognize John was -- he was asking about the operating income relative to New York and whether there was a modest net positives negatives or even you sort of came out and said it is probably even to modest net positive. So, I guess I step back from that. If that's the case why are you spending so much time, money, and effort in fighting all these regulations? Is it more altruistic about the impact it could have to housing in your core markets? I am just trying to put those two things together? Mark Parrell : We are certainly charitable folks here at Equity Residential, but I'm not sure we are motivated in or act with politicians through altruism. I think we don't know what they'll do and what they won't do. And so when we enter into these conversations I think on our own behalf and on behalf of what we think the greater good, we want these cities to thrive. We think this policy even though it didn't hurt us is bad for the city as a whole. And in the long run as citizens of New York City because we're enormous investors in that market and we have employees that live in that market and residents we think good policy is better for us. So, listen they could easily do some things that would be bad for us and we just need to stay in front of them and keep that education process going. So, I guess for us having more political interaction is probably the way it's going to be from now on at least until all this pressure kind of moderates across the country. Michael Bilerman : So, you're saying in the long-term potential detrimental effect to the city in terms of rent control and what that may do in terms of people wanting to live here and do things that ultimately will drive and thrive for people that are multifamily assets and if that is going to disrepair, it has impact on the quality of life and the quality of the city and so even though it may not have a direct -- a large negative impact to your values or income, you -- rather the city being more prosperous? Mark Parrell : Yes. And I think just as citizens we should help that. These big great cities like New York and San Francisco are creating all these great jobs. They don't places for people to live. And so you are unable -- I mean a lot of the job growth that may be slowing in places like San Francisco is just because no one else to employ they have nowhere to live. So, I mean there's a lot of studies that GDP growth in United States and average earnings per family would all be higher if we are able to house people more effectively in all these cities. So, I think you've hit it precisely. Michael Bilerman : Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Mark Parrell. Please go ahead. Mark Parrell : Well, thank you all for your time on the call. Hope everyone has a safe summer and we'll see everyone around the conference circuit in September.",

These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now, I will turn it over to Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Thanks, Marty. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Continued solid demand for our product is driving absorption of new supply and our excellent people and properties that produced record high resident retention and this all resulted in same-store revenue growth that is in line with the expectations we shared with you on our July call. While we are not giving precise guidance at this time, we do want to share the basic building blocks and thought process that we are undertaking to determine next year same same-store revenue guidance. The important inputs to our process include expected supply, our embedded growth which for us that means the growth inherent in our rent roll headed into 2020, and most importantly and most difficult for us to handicap our perspective on demand, which influences both our occupancy and rate growth estimates. A new factor this year is a negative impact of regulatory changes in California and New York, will have on our same-store revenue numbers. In a moment, Michael Manelis, our COO, will give you color on our third quarter operating performance and revised full-year same-store operating guidance, and discuss our 2020 building blocks and then we\u2019ll open the call up to your questions So moving on to investments, with the exception in New York, where activity since the new rent control on June is too limited, the draw any conclusions on the product we own. We have seen cap rates modestly decline across our markets, pushing up values, bidding tense are more crowded and competition among buyers is fierce. This is especially true for B and C quality assets were value-add play may exist. As we have stated previously, this is compressed cap rates between new and older product. Our response to this has been accelerate the sale of older or less strategic assets and the purchased assets that better fit our long-term strategy and minimal to no dilution. During the third quarter, we are busy acquiring four new properties, consistent with this strategy and selling seven older assets, three properties we acquired are in California, these are new properties, so they will not be subject to the new rent control law for almost 15 years. The first property is a 237-unit property in the Little Tokyo submarket of Downtown, Los Angeles. This asset was built in 2017, and we bought it for a purchase price of approximately $105.2 million, and at a cap rate of 4.4%. With a Walk Score of 96, the asset is a short walk to multiple transit hubs and is proximate to both extensive employment concentrations and interesting entertainment options. The second is a 398-unit property built in 2017 in the Korea town submarket of Los Angeles at a purchase price of approximately $189 million and at a cap rate of 4.3%. The property, which is a retail component, has excellent access to both public transit and freeways, with abundant nearby entertainment options and sports a 97 Walk Score. The third asset we acquired is a 137-unit property on the Peninsula in the San Francisco Bay Area, which was acquired for approximately $108 million at a 4.3% cap rate. This property is very near Caltrain station and is in close proximity to many large technology employers. Our last acquisition was the purchase of a 312-unit property in the Denver suburbs. This asset was built in 2016. We bought it for a purchase price of approximately $88 million and at a cap rate of 4.7%. This property is an example of the kind of well located suburban elevator building and is likely to make up about 30% of our portfolio in Denver. During the third quarter, we also sold seven assets; one was Park at Pentagon Row, a 30 year asset and near Amazon HQ2 that we discussed on last quarter\u2019s call, the other 6 sales with the vast majority of our portfolio in Berkeley, California. These were 6 smaller buildings that totaled 343 units, and were sold for an aggregate price of approximately $187 million. These buildings are about 20 years old and have significant student populations, making them operationally intensive to operate. The 7 properties sold during the quarter had an average disposition yield of 4.7%, and generated an un-levered IRR of approximately 7.6%. We also completed two developments during the third quarter, with offset Kendall Square 2 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This is an 84-unit property built at a total development cost of approximately $51.4 million, that we expect will generate a stabilized yield of 5.4%. This property was developed at the second phase of our existing Kendall Square Loft asset and is an excellent addition to our portfolio in the booming Cambridge Life Sciences area. We are particularly pleased with the speed of our lease-up at this property. We also just completed our 137 unit Chloe on Madison Project in Seattle. The total cost of this project was approximately $65.3 million and we expect that it will generate a stabilized yield of 5.4%. This asset was built adjacent to our Chloe on Union asset in the Pine Pike Corridor of Seattle. Switching to new development, the capital availability story is somewhat different than for existing assets. We continue to hear from reputable local and regional developers with good projects, unable to put their equity stack together in light of escalating construction costs and shrinking build to yields. We have been pursuing a few of these opportunities as joint ventures and believe that investing our capital in shovel-ready deals, in sound deal structures that provide some protection to our capital is a good way to source new properties, while managing some of the risk inherent in development. We started two developments during the quarter. Arrow Apartments is a 200 unit mid-rise property that we are developing in a joint venture with a prominent regional developer. This property is part of the master plan community on the site of a former Naval Air Station and will have dedicated Ferry Service to San Francisco. We expect to build our 200 units for a total development cost of approximately $117.8 million and we expect to produce a stabilized yield of 5.3%. Our other new development is 4885 Edgemoor Lane. This is a 154-unit property in downtown Bethesda, adjacent to an existing EQR asset. This is a ground lease deal, where we have the right to acquire the fee interest in about 20 years. We will develop this 15-story high rise for a total cost of approximately $75.3 million and expect to produce a stabilized yield of 5.9%. We think the recent increase in office space in Bethesda will create more demand for rental housing that this well located property will capture new office workers who want to leave conveniently to work, while having excellent access to the Metro and entertainment amenities. On the capital markets front, as you saw in the release, we took advantage of a very favorable environment and issued $600 million in unsecured debt, with the yield of 2.56%. There was tremendous demand for the issuance and we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the execution and I congratulate the team for it. Finally, before I hand it over to Michael, I want to make a comment on rent control. With California recently passing AB 1482, both that state and New York have introduced new regulations on rents, the new laws are complex and will create compliance challenges for all landlords, while also acting as a powerful disincentive to building the new affordable apartments needed in these two states. We agree that there is a shortage of workforce in affordable housing in many places in our country, but believe the actions taken in New York and California will not help solve these problems. These new housing loss would discourage the production of new housing and do not materially address the root causes of housing production shortages, like zoning regulations that prohibit construction of multi-unit housing and other excessive governmental regulation. We also think that over time it will lead to the deterioration of the existing affordable housing stock. Through our trade associations, we will continue to encourage policymakers to embrace actions like zoning reform and the removal of regulatory barriers to new housing construction as well as programs that create incentives for private market developers to build the affordable housing units our city so badly need. I will now turn the call over to Michael Manelis. Michael Manelis : Thanks Mark. So I would like to begin with a shout out to all of the employees of Equity Residential. The third quarter represents our busiest leasing period of the year, with just over one-third of the entire year\u2019s transactions taking place. The team\u2019s focus on delivering remarkable experiences to our new customers and current residents continues to pay off, and allowed us to achieve our highest recorded resident satisfaction scores, while increasing our all-time high online reputation scores. Favorable operating fundamentals continue through the quarter with strong occupancy of 96.5% which is 20 basis points above Q3 of 2018. Record low resident turnover delivering a 5% achieved renewal increase for the quarter and strong demand to close out the peak leasing season. While we reported strong occupancy this quarter, we anticipate that the balance of the year will moderate in line with normal seasonal decline, a process that has already begun, and should result in our full year same-store occupancy ending up at 96.4%, which supports our 3.3% same-store revenue growth. Today, our portfolio is 96.2% occupied, which is exactly where it was this time last year. Base rents are up 2.7% year-over-year renewal performance continues to be very stable with expected achieved renewal rate increases around 5% for the balance of the year, Heading into 2020, the following represent a few top level inputs that will serve as building blocks for our guidance process. Most markets will deliver relatively the same amount of new supply with the exceptions being New York which will have considerably less and Boston, which will have more. We expect demand for our high-quality and well located assets to be relatively the same as 2019, which should equate to similar occupancy next year. Revenue growth in both our California markets and New York will be negatively impacted by about 20 basis points each due to recently enacted rent control rules. For the entire company, this equates to about a 15 to 20 basis point impact to our 2020 same-store revenue growth. We also anticipate starting the year with better embedded growth than we had entering into 2019. So, overall, assuming these inputs hold, we would expect New York, DC, Seattle, and San Diego to deliver equal or better revenue growth next year, and Boston, San Francisco, LA and Orange County to be less. We are in the early stages of our budget process and we will be updating our models throughout the balance of this year and we will issue specific guidance on our January call. So on to the markets, let\u2019s start with Boston. Full year revenue growth expectations have been raised to 3.9% from 3.5% as the results for the quarter were better than expected. The reprieve from head to head supply delivered strong rate growth and most notably an occupancy of 96.4% that was 70 basis points better than the third quarter of 2018. On the supply front, after a quiet 2019, we\u2019re starting to see new competitive supply return to the city of Boston. We are tracking about 5,800 units being delivered in 2020, with roughly 60% of those units in the city of Boston, heavily concentrated in the Seaport. Demand remains strong, bolstered by large corporate expansions and relocations. It also helps that strong demand and increasing rents for office and lab space seems to be tilting the highest and best use for development parcels away from multifamily in the Seaport District, while we have only seen a few of these deals shift, this could create more renters and less supply in future years. The New York market continues to demonstrate strength in overall operating fundamentals, and its performance during the quarter was in line with expectations. There is no change to our full-year same-store revenue growth projection for New York of 2.5%. Overall, we continue to see good economic activity and strong demand for our product in this market. The impact from changes associated with the rent regulations that went into effect in the middle of June are playing out exactly as expected, with approximately a 50 basis point reduction to achieved renewal increases in the second half of the year and about a $400,000 reduction in application and late fees. Combined, these changes to the regulations will reduce our expected New York Metro market revenue performance by approximately 20 basis points in 2019, a similar impact from rent regulations is expected next year. On the supply front, next year we will deliver just over 4,300 units in our competitive footprint, a 50% decline from 2019. While we still see some pressure, the overall competitive nature of this supply will be much less, which should allow us to absorb the impact from rent regulation changes. Washington DC continues to demonstrate strength, despite the elevated deliveries with our full year revenue growth projected to be 2.5%. Results for the quarter were in line with expectations. The market unemployment rate of 3.3% remains below the national average and job growth remains healthy with gains being driven in a large part by the professional and business services sector concentrated in Northern Virginia. Deliveries of 10,000 units per year or more seems to be the new norm for the Washington region. The continued strength in demand is fueling robust Class A absorption, which delivered strong occupancy and improved pricing power for the third quarter. In 2020, we are tracking just over 12,000 units with a notable increase to the capital riverfront area, where we have no direct exposure. Heading over to the West Coast, Seattle outperformed our expectations for the quarter. We have increased our full-year revenue growth projection by 20 basis points to 3.4%. Job growth remains robust. The market is creating jobs at its fastest pace since 2016 and Seattle\u2019s office absorption is the highest it has been in a decade. Gains in job growth was widespread, not just in the technology sector, overall demand for our product remains strong, which has allowed us to maintain high occupancies while pushing rate. On the supply front, the concentration shifted to the East side in 2019, which has allowed pricing power to return to the CBD, where we have several assets. Suburban submarkets have yielded greater rental income growth over the last several years, but that trend reversed for us over the summer, as the downtown submarket rent growth led the pact for the third quarter. Overall deliveries in 2020 will be similar to 2019, with just over 8,000 new units coming online, the concentration will continue to be weighted to the East side in the first half of the year and will then shift back to the CBD Belton submarket in the second half of the year. As I move to the California markets, let me start by providing color on the impact of the new rent control laws. These new regulations go into effect on January 1, 2020, and we have 97 properties or about 70% of our California portfolio subject to the new restrictions next year. The most pronounced impact will be on renewals, as there will be a cap on increase equivalent to CPI plus 5% on all properties that are 15 years or older . The law allows vacancy decontrol, meaning upon move out rents can increase the market pricing about a cap. If these regulations had been in place for 2019, they would have reduced our renewal growth rate by about 50 basis points and our same-store revenue growth in these markets by about 20 basis points. So, moving to San Francisco, we now expect full year same-store revenue growth to be 3.8% which is 20 basis points lower than our July guidance. During the third quarter, we were unable to maintain both occupancy and rate at the high levels we anticipated. We had continued strength in July and August, but September traffic was a little lighter than expected, Today our San Francisco portfolio is 95.5% occupied, which is 10 basis points lower than the same week last year. While reduction in occupancy at this time of the year consistent with normal seasonal declines, this is something that we will continue to watch. Strongest results continue to be posted Downtown and the East Bay continues to face pressure,. On the job front, the Bay Area topped 4.1 million jobs, with 10 straight months of employment gains. It\u2019s possible that the rate of job growth is slowing, But these gains are still strong. Heading into 2020, we\u2019re tracking 9,800 units being delivered, which is similar to 2019. The East Bay will deliver less units and the concentration will shift to the South Bay. Moving down to Los Angeles, full year same-store revenue growth projection is 3.8%, which is 10 basis points lower than our July guidance. As we stated last quarter, we anticipated deceleration due to pressure from new supply that was back half-loaded and had a difficult occupancy comp for the second half of 2018. Occupancy remained strong at 96.3% but we didn\u2019t quite get as much pricing power as expected, resulting in softening rate growth to maintain the needed leasing velocity. Continuing the trend on supply, roughly 2,800 units of deliveries were pushed from 2019 into 2020. These units were originally scheduled to deliver toward the end of 2019, but the story remains the same. With labor shortages and construction delays, this shift results in both 2019 and 2020, having approximately 9,700 units being delivered. Downtown LA, West LA and the San Fernando Valley are the highest supplied submarkets in 2019. We are still about 3,900 competitive units under construction, scheduled to complete by the end of the year, which will continue to put pressure on rates. Moving into 2020, the supply will be concentrated in West LA, Hollywood, and the San Fernando Valley. Downtown LA is expected to see a reduction, so only 1,200 units being delivered which should benefit our pricing power and performance in the back half of the year and a submarket that is close to 20% of our LA revenue. Orange County delivered third quarter results, which were better than we expected, primarily driven by 40 basis points of stronger occupancy than this time last year. Our full-year revenue growth guidance has been increased by 20 basis points to 3.8%. As I\u2019ve stated before, we have a diverse set of properties in Orange County, and not all victim competes head to head with the 2019 supply. 2020 is expected to be similar with just over 2700 units being delivered. San Diego performed as expected in the third quarter and there is no change to our full-year revenue growth guidance at 3.4%. Overall, the newer product downtown continues to pressure our pricing power as we think about next year, supply will be lower with just over 2,100 units being delivered. On the initiatives front, we continue to make great progress toward the sales and service road map that we shared in our June investor update. On the sales front, we will have just over a third of our communities on our artificial intelligence e-lead platform by the end of the year we will have deployed self-guided tours at over 25% of our communities. On the service side of the business, our new mobility platform for our service teams will be fully deployed by the end of the year. We also have approximately 2,500 units enabled with smart home technology. During the quarter, we launched our new resident portal and app, our app adoption has grown to 55% of households, with our original portal, residents will continue to pay rent and service request online, but now have many additional features that will allow them to engage with each other. We can already see them taking advantage of self-service functionality in the portal to reserve amenities, register guests, and leverage the social platform to facilitate gatherings and post items for sale. We hope that this continues to increase resident satisfaction and stickiness. The evolution of our operating platform is underway. The new technology will enable continued centralization and digitalization to further enhance the resident and employee experience. Over the next few quarters, we expect to provide more detailed updates on the financial and customer impact from these and other initiatives. At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead, sir. Nick Joseph : Thanks. Maybe just starting with guidance, historically, for the fourth quarter, you have seen an acceleration both in terms of core NFFO and also same-store NOI growth and this year seems to be an exception. So I am wondering if you can walk through what\u2019s the variance of that versus historical years? Bob Garechana : Thanks Nick. It\u2019s Bob Garechana. It is really three-fold items overall as it relates to the NFFO guidance, the $0.03 identified in the press release. The first of which is really timing of transaction activity. During the fourth quarter, our guidance incorporates about $300 million in dispositions and in the third quarter we had a similar amount of dispositions, but actually had $500 million roughly of acquisitions that Mark went through, front unloaded, so that\u2019s about a penny of delta. It is also timing of other items, predominantly corporate overhead and some other expense items as well and then that\u2019s another penny, and then the last penny is to same-store, so you are right. As you look at sequential same-store revenue, it specifically does decelerate between the third and the fourth quarter, which is what we have embedded in our guidance today, that modest kind of traditional deceleration that you see from seasonal activity. You usually also see some expense seasonality and you see expenses actually decline from the third quarter to the fourth quarter in a pretty material amount historically and we don\u2019t expect to see that as much this year and that is largely driven by the timing of some real estate tax appeals and some other items and that is really driving that last penny that we identified in the release. Nick Joseph : Thanks. And then Mark you are active with California acquisition and I note the recent law doesn\u2019t impact those assets, but is your underwriting standards change at all either quantitatively or qualitatively, given the more broad regulatory environment in California? Mark Parrell : Thanks for that question, Nick. Yes. We have talked I think more than ever before. And we have always had a regulatory component to our underwriting, but it has been a bigger discussion. We have done things like sensitized exit cap rates. We generally think about asset whole periods in our pro forma is 10 years. So 10 years from now, these assets will be closer to the end of their protected period. So we have sensitize those cap rates at the end, those exit cap rates, a little and thought about them in a few different ways, so that we would be more thoughtful about maybe how those assets might trade 10 years from now. Again, mostly we do generally hold assets longer than 10 years, but we need to be a little bit more mindful, so we did that analysis and we were still happy to hold the assets, so generally changed our IRRs from mid 7 IRRs to high 6 IRRs by doing that, Nick. Bob Garechana : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead, sir. Nick Yulico : Thanks. So you had this unusual dynamic this quarter for new lease growth where, strengthened on the East Coast and it weakened in California. You talked about some of the California issues, but it also looks like your new lease gross debts were weaker than some of the industry stats we\u2019re looking at in California. So just hoping to get a little bit more info on how new lease growth turned negative in the third quarter for the California markets? Michael Manelis : Yes. So, this is Michael. So I guess first I just want to call out that I think we\u2019ve talked about before that looking at any of these stats for the stand-alone quarter on new lease change, it\u2019s probably not the best way to think about it, it\u2019s probably more indicative to think over long term of the year, but specific to the quarter. I guess I want to call out what we report on Page 15 in that release is really the impact from all lease terms, meaning regardless of what lease was in place when the resident moved out to the replacement rent, when we tend to when we isolate the leases that were just like term or just 12 month lease to 12 monthly month lease, we see about a 100 basis point improvement in the results for the quarter. So I would say that we started, we understood that we were going to see deceleration. I think I mentioned in on the previous call, but if you look specifically like at LA, LA instead of reporting the negative 20 basis points would have reported 80 basis points if I just isolate it out for the life-term or the 12 to 12 and that would have been a positive. The quarter actually performed pretty consistent with what we expected. We knew we were going to face back half pressure on supply and you can see that in San Diego and you can see that and LA and the areas that we have supply have the most pronounced kind of pressure on that new lease change. As I said in my prepared remarks, I mean Downtown LA actually is going to see a reduction in supply next year. So we would expect some pricing power to return to us there. Nick Yulico : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. So it sounds like the read through here is that you\u2019re not expecting these, the new lease growth numbers in the California markets to stay negative going forward? Mark Parrell : Well, I guess I will tell you as we hit the fourth quarter, they will most likely be negative, they typically are negative and I talked about that before that there is a seasonality component to these stats, which is why when you isolate any one quarter, it\u2019s not always indicative of the full year. Nick Yulico : Okay, thanks. Just last question Mark I guess how are you thinking about doing more acquisitions right, EQR hasn\u2019t been a net acquirer in a while and your stock price is looking more attractive. Would you issue equity to do that, what is kind of the size of the opportunity set you\u2019re looking at, is this something that you would be considering at all? Mark Parrell : Thanks Nick. No, we are certainly open to getting larger, I think the market is giving us a growth signal, I would start by saying, as I said in my prepared remarks, the transaction market with the kind of quality assets we want is extremely competitive. So it\u2019s not like we have a whole bunch of things that have piled up that we\u2019d love to acquire. I mean we\u2019re buying pretty well everything again that fits into the window that we\u2019re comfortable with on price. So I would start by saying, there isn\u2019t a lot left that we haven\u2019t done to begin with. I also point out that if you were to use, for example, the ATM. The implied cap rate on the stock as compared to the kind of asset cap rates we have is not going to create a great deal of accretion at least immediately for the company. I would say we\u2019re more interested in potentially issuing debt and buying assets. I mean I think we have a pretty modest leverage profile, we are not suggesting we are going to pile the debt on, but I think we\u2019re in a position where we could certainly spend a considerable amount of money and fund it with debt to buy assets if we could find enough good assets to buy. So definitely that\u2019s top of mind for us Nick. But it\u2019s probably more of a debt play at this point than it is use of the ATM or some discrete secondary. Nick Yulico : Thank you, Mark. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Shirley Wu with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Shirley Wu : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, just a follow-up to Nick\u2019s earlier question on the rent regulation AB 1482, so what is your most input based on it? Did you guys see any impact to transactions markets or in terms of, let\u2019s say hesitation to jump into those markets, just given that new regulation has been in place? Mark Parrell : Hi, Shirley. It\u2019s Mark. Thanks for the question. We have not. California has really just kept going. I mean, cap rates have generally kind of been steady to declining for our kind of assets. So we have not seen, I think that\u2019s because California was so well discussed to the credit of the policymakers the activists representing the tenant groups, and the companies like ours and the owners, everyone was involved in this conversation about rent control and rent reform. And so when this all came to pass, everyone understood it and the regulations made sense in the market digested it. I contrast that to New York, where it was done, as I\u2019ve said before, sort of in the dark night, probably wasn\u2019t as well thought through. And I think the implications are harder to understand the transaction market in New York. But in California everything feels about the same to us. Shirley Wu : That\u2019s great to hear. But there is talks of a new ballot initiatives that kind of brings back this the previous conversation about repealing Costa Hawkins in 2020. Have you heard anything in terms of updated news on that front? Mark Parrell : Sure. So this is what the industry has been calling Prop 10 2.0, and the proponent put out a press release recently saying as we expected, but they have enough signatures to put this on the ballot. Again that\u2019s what the industry anticipated. I will tell you we are very well organized. There have been the industry meetings about this. We beat this by about 20 percentage points back in November, educated the public, educated policymakers it was just a bad idea. We think the same approach is justified here again, we intend to be very much aggressive and out there having these conversations in the public space about how this sort of repeal of Costa Hawkins is going to do the exact opposite of what people want, there will be less supply, there will be less investment in existing stock of housing, both single family and multifamily by the way, and we\u2019re going to have that conversation to be very forthright about it So at this point, I feel pretty good about, again our organization in the industry to oppose that measure. Shirley Wu : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Please go ahead, sir. Rich Hightower : Hi, good morning guys. Mark Parrell : Hey, good morning. Rich Hightower : Good morning. So, Mark, I want to go back to a couple of your comments in the prepared remarks around developer equity appetite and just in the sense of the portion of the cap stack required from the equity or the cost of capital and maybe wondering if there is something of a disconnect there between public and private in the sense that the apartment REITs are obviously trading very well and have opportunity that comes from that versus what you are seeing on the private side and how does that lead to opportunities for EQR. I know obviously at least one of the developments that you guys started in the quarter was it was a joint venture? And just wondering what the opportunity set might be that emanates from some of this phenomenon? Mark Parrell : Yes, we have a few other. Thank you for the question. We have a few other of these sort of opportunities we are talking to. We have just seen and we telegraphed this on the prior call, it was just more inbound call volume. Developers we know, regional folks, reputable local folks that have had no problem getting equity and now do and we think some of that is just again build to yields have gotten low. A lot of folks who made a lot of money on development maybe they are a little anxious about where they are in the cycle. A lot of people that are building, they build for a window. So these, developers are building, needing to deliver as merchant builders in a window and things need to be great in 2022 or 2023 or they don\u2019t make money, that is not the way we think about development. We want to like our unit cost in our per square foot cost and our location in the long run. So I think we do have an advantage right now at the moment where we\u2019re able to take a longer view, where we do have ample capital and these opportunities, again you can put in front of you, the capital of the developer, they\u2019re out there, taking the completion risk initially, now again these developers have capitalization, not as significant as ours and they have experience and we watch over their shoulders. So we think we get a little risk mitigation and there is a little bit of an opportunity right now to kind of jump in the deals that are ready to go. So I do think there is a little bit of a window here for us. Rich Hightower : Okay, great. That\u2019s great color. And then maybe just a second question quickly \u2013 2020 supply, sorry about that. So obviously, the numbers we look at coming from Axiare or other sources seem to change every single quarter. It\u2019s very hard to get a grip on what\u2019s really in the pipeline. What\u2019s really likely to open by a certain date? So how much flex do you guys put into your forecast in that regard? Michael Manelis : Yes, I mean so we have a process right where we have boots on the ground kind of validating this stuff, I mean it\u2019s pretty hard right now to think that in most of these markets that anything to get delivered in 2020 that we\u2019re not aware of, as you start to get to the shoulder periods, especially like the Q3, Q4. You could see things shift from what we thought was going to be a completion in 2019 shifting into 2020. We\u2019ve seen that now in LA consistently occurring. So I think as you get to the shoulder periods, it\u2019s normal to see some of this stuff shift. And I think on average we see about 10% to 15% shift, in LA we started seeing it to be a little bit more pronounced like 20%, 25% of the unit shifts. But as far as the total quantity, the process that we go through with our local investment team in the market trying to understand the competitive nature of supply in our competitive marketplace, the deals don\u2019t kind of come and go. Mark Parrell : Yes, I want to add one thing, Rich. This stuff becomes competitive even earlier. So before the CMO comes there out their pre-leasing that pressures operators and people like us with properties in the area. So sometimes moving from December to January, it looks like something in all of us from a distance, but from the operator perspective it\u2019s meaningless. And I also point out, when you have 20% of LA move from \u201818 and \u201819 and 20% move from \u201819 and \u201820, nothing really happened. I mean all that happened is, we have done some good interesting analytical work where we see the pattern and really this is the point where the numbers for example, for 2020 are at their highest and from here they\u2019ll just decline because deals will keep getting pushed or moved or changed in some regard. So there is a bit of a pattern here where I think we all start looking at numbers that end up being much lower in the long run, because stuff just naturally pushes. Rich Hightower : Got it. Thank you very much. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead, sir. John Pawlowski : Thanks. Mark, apologies if I missed this. Could you just give us on the development opportunities, what you expect a reasonable development pipeline size to look like for EQR next year? Mark Parrell : Thanks, John. So I would probably put it in terms of spend, if that\u2019s helpful. So the way we\u2019ve talked about it with the Board is, we feel like we can spend $500 million a year on development, which would consist of the $300 million of excess cash flow that we have every year after all, our CapEx needs are met, as well as, call it $200 million of additional leverage from the growth in EBITDA. We do that, we don\u2019t need to sell assets, we don\u2019t need to access to capital and we won\u2019t need to do anything, we can just sort of self fund and in that case, then we think that\u2019s the best safest way to do it. So I would expect our goal is to get close to opening starting, say $500 million in 2020. We have one large deal in the West Coast. We are working hard on that would be half of that. So, and there is a number of other play, that are really interesting that are density plays, where we\u2019re knocking down say 40 or so garden units and replacing them with 200, 250 mid-rise units and we have a number of projects like that going on in the West Coast that we hope to start next year, and a few going on in the East and may take a little longer. So I mean that\u2019s where you should see, in terms of a range, probably spend $300 million, $400 million, $500 million a year and us looking at both JV development, some of this legacy land bank we still have of lower priced brand and these density plays that we think are interesting. John Pawlowski : Okay. And Michael, can you give us some more specifics about your opening remarks about weakness in traffic, foot traffic in San Francisco and not able to maintain occupancy or rate and just what are you seeing on the ground in terms of leading demand indicators for your San Fran portfolio? Michael Manelis : So, I mean it\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s submarket specific. So even if I just think about the results in the quarter, like the Downtown portfolio produced like 6% revenue growth compared to the East Bay at 2.5. When you start looking at the traffic patterns our traffic is down, but like I said it was strong July and August. And then in September, we started to see that shift. We went back and we kind of just looked against all of our available units, the volume of traffic we\u2019re getting, just as a ratio and compared it. And when you look at it, it\u2019s really seems to be following more of like a 2017 pattern versus the 2018 that really defy kind of a seasonal decline. So I think right now the demand is really just kind of overall it\u2019s mixed. It\u2019s definitely kind of following the normal seasonal decline, but I haven\u2019t seen anything that suggests it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s going to be any greater than normal. Does that help? John Pawlowski : Is it is Oakland supply starting to suck out demand or... Michael Manelis : Yes. So it\u2019s interesting. So at the back door, meaning people leaving us and giving us forwarding addresses to Oakland. We see very little of that activity. Less than 2% of our kind of move-outs give us that forwarding address, but you can look at the Oakland assets that are coming online right now, and they are performing well, their concessions are reasonable than what you would expect from a lease-up. So they are probably siphoning off some demand on the front door right now. John Pawlowski : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Richard Hill : Hey, guys. Quick question on the leasing spreads, I thought your comments about like-for-like leasing spreads were around 100 basis points higher, it was pretty interesting and I hope that hopefully I got that number right. I\u2019m curious, are you seeing tenants ask for longer leases. Because it seems like your commentary would suggest so, and the reason I ask is one of the consequences of written regulation was maybe tenants would stay in their leases for longer, so I\u2019m curious, are you seeing leases longer and is that intentional on your part. And how are you thinking about it? Mark Parrell : So you are correct. First of all that, the spread is about 100 basis points improvement in new lease change when you isolate to the 12 to 12. I haven\u2019t really seen much from a demand standpoint changing in the willingness to take long-term leases we\u2019ve done some stuff in LA we do some stuff strategically in front of some of the supply to try to get some longer leases in place, but we haven\u2019t seen anything whether that be in New York or California yet that would suggest consumers are looking for longer term leases or that turnover has changed. I mean New York turnover, for example, one of my questions, which is whether we would see a difference between our market rate and our rent stabilized portfolio in terms of turnover and they both are moving in the similar way. So maybe I guess it\u2019s just one quarter of data and we\u2019ll see, but my expectation was that the rent stabilized portfolio would start to have even lower turnover than the market rate portfolio, but that has not yet proven to be true. Richard Hill : Got it. And look, I mean is going everyone focusing on the negatives of rent regulation, but I think there were some foreign investors that would argue that this in the consequences of restricting supply and accelerating rents, could you comment about how you think about that maybe over the medium to long-term and either California or New York? Mark Parrell : Yes, it\u2019s Mark. We certainly have talked on several occasions, the fact that these rent control rules in the long run are going to reduce supply and even though the affordable New York program for example wasn\u2019t specifically changed, these sort of rules have a chilling effect on capital going into development. And so for an owner like us of properties that already have a relatively low basis because we\u2019ve owned them a long time, in a lot of regards the government has now been our partner in reducing supply and increasing the competitive moat. But and we also have opportunities on expenses that we\u2019ve talked about whether it\u2019s leasing and advertising, because again, we\u2019re more highly occupied, turn costs and the like, but I have to be fair about this and I\u2019ve said this before, rent regulation when it reduces the amount the supply of housing, ultimately reduces the dynamism and vibrancy of a city and that\u2019s not good for us. We would rather see and take a little bit of pain in the short run but see these neighborhoods continue to build out and our existing assets become even more popular and there will be even more entertainment options and more of everything. So I would suggest that rent control is I think we can manage through and to this point has been not as significant as maybe some folks who thought it would be, but it\u2019s hard for me to say that it\u2019s a positive in the long run to these cities. Richard Hill : Got it. Mark Parrell : Because \u2013 I think it\u2019s very damaging to the cities. Richard Hill : Got it. And just one follow-up question, the 4.4% cap rate that you cited, I think, some would say that\u2019s pretty compelling against the global macro backdrop where we stand right now, is 4.5% cap just sort of steady state for where you see cap rates right now. I guess I\u2019m not asking you to tell me where they\u2019re going forward. But is 4.5% cap representative of where you think you could buy, let\u2019s just say the LA market for instance? Mark Parrell : Yes, I think that\u2019s probably fair or maybe a little bit lower. I mean I think the range we\u2019re operating in is 4.3% to 4.7% for markets like Boston near the low end of that cap rate range, where it\u2019s just super competitive and a market like Denver more toward the higher end of that range. Richard Hill : Got it. Helpful color guys. Thanks very much. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. John Kim : Thank you. This quarter your dispositions were very targeted in Berkeley. And as we get prop 10, 2.0 as you call it coming back. Are you looking to reposition out of certain markets within California or is age really the primary factor of the asset sales? Mark Parrell : Certainly the regulatory scheme, the pressure we feel, the welcome frankly that the city puts out for us is a factor. The Berkeley assets had both asset characteristics and city characteristics that made them worth selling. So I\u2019d say we aware of places where it\u2019s more difficult to do business and we factor that into our decisions to sell. John Kim : Okay. And sticking to the market, do you have any commentary on Google and Facebook and potentially other tech companies investing billions of capital into the housing market in San Francisco? Is there any potential for you to partner with these on the development or to participate in their incentive program? Mark Parrell : Sure. While we welcome those sorts of conversations certainly, and I know we try and engage in of sort of dialogs. I think this is great. I think Facebook\u2019s announcement I believe was $1 billion and I think that equated to about $50,000 a unit. So clearly there is something else going on here in terms of the government matching or contributing land or doing some other things. I think it\u2019s great to alleviate some of these housing shortages. I think it\u2019s very thoughtful for big office users to also be thinking about housing. And I think this is just another ingredient in the solution that the government can utilize if it sees fit. John Kim : But can EQR partner with them or is that not really\u2026 Mark Parrell : Sure, we are open to that. We are absolutely open to that. And a lot of cases they are making \u2013 if they are building a project that\u2019s employee specific, for tech company is building what amounts to a dormitory for their employees, that\u2019s probably a little less interesting for us. If they are building properties where in along with maybe the city contributing land and they\u2019re contributing capital and we are in a partnership and we are building it, that\u2019s all, that\u2019s very interesting. Those kind of opportunities would be very worthwhile for us. John Kim : Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thanks. And our next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Derek Johnston : Hi everyone. With cap rates currently low and development yield targets hard to justify. We expect continued and possibly accelerated capital recycling. Going forward, I think you guys have mentioned that, will you be focusing on Denver I think that\u2019s certainly a key market, but currently a pretty small earnings contributor. So what is the target NOI contribution you\u2019d like to see from that market? Mark Parrell : Yes, great question. So our goal, as we mentioned in Denver is to get it up to call it 5% of our NOI. Right now it\u2019s about 1.5%. That\u2019s probably funded with some incremental capital but probably some recycling out of places like Washington DC, where we like the market, but we have a significant concentration and where there been some serious supply issues over the years, as well as maybe some money from some of the other markets here and there. So I think you can expect us to continue to acquire in Denver, we acquired one asset in the past quarter, we have almost $600 million invested in that market and I\u2019d like to see that number closer to $2 billion and our concentration closer to 5%. Derek Johnston : Excellent. Helpful. And then what is the new low end requirement on development yields from your perspective. Just given the environment today, I think you mentioned a projected 5.2% on an asset, I think was in San Francisco during the opening remarks. So what would the low end be? Mark Parrell : Well, the way you just spoke to that is really the merchant builder thought process and that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s not our thought process. I mean the fact that we can build something in a place for example it\u2019s very hard to build like Boston, the fact that we can build a tower there and maybe, and we\u2019ve said this, we have slightly lower than 5% current yield on that property mark to market, if you mark the land to market on that deal, that doesn\u2019t bother us in the least because we really like our basis in the asset, it\u2019s hard to buy, it\u2019s a location we really like, we like everything about the demand and supply dynamics. So I don\u2019t have a number \u2013 it was a 4.5% cap rate on current rents, we are were done. I don\u2019t feel that way. I think as we talk about, it is a group as a management team and with the board. It\u2019s about how protected is that market, what are the demand dynamics, how do we feel about our basis and our per square foot and unit basis. So for us, it isn\u2019t just I got to deliver it at a 5.5% cap rate, two years from now, because I got one year to sell it or else my equity would wipe me out as a developer. That\u2019s just not the kind of deals we do. For us, I think it\u2019s a little bit different of a thought process and it isn\u2019t a minimum. It\u2019s just part of the ingredients of the thought process. You still there? Derek Johnston : Yes. Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please go ahead, sir. Rich Anderson : Thanks. Good morning. So on the cap rates, can you just \u2013 those are economic cap rates that you saw in the acquisitions and dispositions? Mark Parrell : Yes, they are after our normal thought process on CapEx for these types of assets. Rich Anderson : Okay. So is it, what do you assume on the buy side and what do you assume on the sell side from a CapEx perspective? Mark Parrell : Well, it depends. I mean some of the older assets we sell. it\u2019s got a higher CapEx low to them I have some of the stuff in front of me, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m in a position to give you exact numbers \u2013 we talked about in our disclosure materials on \u2013 page 27 I think we define for you acquisition capitalization rate or cap rate and give you a sense of kind of what the underwriting looks like from a in unit replacement, CapEx etcetera, and how that\u2019s kind of condition that might give you some color, Rich. Rich Anderson : Alright. So I guess my point is very little, if any dilution from these trades, but if you were to load, got to the FFO line. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s more important. But if you were what would the spread be or do you have that number available to you, if it\u2019s 30 basis points on an economic basis? Mark Parrell : Do you mean FFO \u2013 AFFO of after the replacement reserves and everything else for example? Yes, like Park at Pentagon Row that\u2019s, that\u2019s a good thing to talk about for a second. I mean we looked at the buyers numbers as best we can. And again, that\u2019s not what we disclose and we put in $200 a unit for that per year. I can tell you that number is way too low. We also put $200 unit in some of the 2017, 2018 product we bought in California. And I think that number is just fine on stuff that was built a year to 18 months ago. So I think when you start to get to where the rubber meets the road and what you\u2019re replacements really are a lot of the stuff we\u2019re doing isn\u2019t accretive in the long run, it\u2019s accretive right then and now. Rich Anderson : Yes. Okay, alright. And then shifting to California, 48% of your portfolio, housing shortage, regulation, business unfriendly, wildfires, earthquakes, school funding issues, out-migration of population, you know, there is a lot of things going on in California and yet you are showing signs of continuing to grow there. Would it be fair to say that you\u2019re not going to get smaller in California, but younger, is that the basic game plan or do you see yourself, sort of whittling down your exposure to rent control inclusive of New York City, which brings up to about 63% exposed to rent control situations? Mark Parrell : Well, I mean there\u2019s so much to un-bundle in that. I mean, I just want to start by saying, you do have plague a horrible, as you mentioned in California, but there is a lot of positives that we wouldn\u2019t known and I know, is that you\u2019re a veteran guy, you know that. I mean the job creation machine in California. The Company creation machine, a whole employment picture in the United States is to some extent driven by what\u2019s going on in California In terms of technology and going on in the West Coast and now spread everywhere throughout the country. So I would say, we like a lot of the dynamics there and things that would scare us about California are mostly about those job dynamics changing, that sort of demand stuff would be most concerning to us, we don\u2019t, as Michael said in his remarks on San Francisco, we just don\u2019t see that yet. I also say that Prop 13 and remember the split role initiative doesn\u2019t affect us in the apartment business. Having your largest single expense, significantly lower, I mean we have a lot of markets where outside of New York, where property taxes are going up 5%, 7% a year. And in California, they are considerably lower. That\u2019s a huge advantage to us in terms of what our return is. So I\u2019d say there is still plenty of positive things about California, notwithstanding some of the elements of the plagues that you mentioned earlier. And I think you hit it on the head in terms of the California strategy. We do not want to have more NOI in California that we have now. I think we\u2019re about right, maybe a little lower be okay too, but I think we do want to be younger. I think we have some older assets that even withstanding, notwithstanding rent control we want to sell. And I think we\u2019ll continue along that play and you\u2019ll see us sell some of the stuff that\u2019s a little bit older in the portfolio and try and keep our portfolio in California particularly young. Rich Anderson : Perfect. That\u2019s all I got. Thanks. Mark Parrell : Thank you, sir. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Drew Babin with Baird. Please go ahead, sir. Drew Babin : Hey, good morning. Mark Parrell : Good morning. Drew Babin : Wanted to expand on Richard\u2019s question, demand growth in California, obviously there is a bit of a North heavy element to that and with LA with the revenue growth expectations coming down to say, despite some supply being pushed out in the next year, I guess is the demand picture in LA and I guess Southern California generally been somewhat disappointing, I know had kind of a slow start to the year, kind of came back. Can you talk a little more about that trajectory, as it applies to Southern California and what we might expect for next year? Mark Parrell : Yes, so I don\u2019t say that Southern Cal is disappointing at all on the demand side. I think what you\u2019re seeing right now in our numbers and what we\u2019ve talked about even in the previous quarters is we knew deceleration was going to be come and just based on the supply coming right on top of us. So even though while there was that shift of supply kind of moving the supply is on top of us in Downtown LA right now and we feel that, but the demand is still strong for our type of product. It\u2019s just, we\u2019re not having as much pricing power. And as I think as you go into 2020 just in my prepared remarks, we recognize that we\u2019re still going to have that pressure sitting on us in the first part of the year and LA. So I think it\u2019s clear to say that it\u2019s not that the demand is shifting. It\u2019s really more just the pressure that we\u2019re feeling from the supplier. Drew Babin : Okay, appreciate the color. And then on one more shift to the East Coast new leasing spreads. If you kind of average that over the full year have gone from negative in some cases to flat to kind of what I\u2019ll call may be inflationary levels, given the current national employment backdrop, wage growth trends, home ownership trends, demographic trends, all the things you look at, I guess how do you feel about the potential for those leasing spreads to maybe exceed, to maybe go to like a CPI plus type of territory in the near-term, based on everything we know right now, kind of the steady state economy? Mark Parrell : Well, I guess, I would tell you, I kind of opened it up, which is what we thought about kind of next year at the high level for some of those markets. But I would say the momentum for the East Coast markets has been strong, but you\u2019ve got to factor in just like I said, for next year with Boston. We\u2019re starting to see the supply come back on us in Boston, which mean just like the conversation we had in LA, we will experience some pricing pressure that we haven\u2019t had to deal with this year, but the overall demand picture and the overall momentum that we feel on new lease growth and renewal growth is really good in the East Coast markets. Drew Babin : I appreciate all the color. Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead. Alexander Goldfarb : I guess it\u2019s still good morning out there. Mark Parrell : Good morning Alexander Goldfarb : I have two questions. Good morning. I have two questions. You gave some color on revenue, the other element obviously our expenses which have outpaced revenue this year. So as you think about next year and what you\u2019re seeing on the different elements that form the OpEx, do you think that this year\u2019s sort of outpacing revenue that\u2019s going to continue next year, or are there some initiatives or abilities for you guys to contain such that OpEx will grow inside of revenue next year? Bob Garechana : Hey, Alex. Bob. Obviously, we\u2019re very focused on reducing that number. Overall, I think if you look at our 10-year history, we generated something that\u2019s well under 3% on expenses and we\u2019d like to get to that arena again. One of the things that we\u2019ve talked about on the screen called many times that is a challenge for us is the 421a assets. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress in the sales that we\u2019ve had in reducing that rate of growth, but it does to overall, same-store expenses on average contribute 60 basis points of incremental growth. So anything away at that could obviously present some opportunities. Michael talked about in the past initiatives and opportunities that we will focus on there, but it\u2019s hard to get over that real estate tax piece, although we\u2019ve done a lot to make that better. Alexander Goldfarb : Right. But I mean looking across all your items are sort of 3% plus. So it\u2019s not just the real estate taxes. Bob Garechana : No. Yes. So it\u2019s not just real estate taxes, right. There are some things that I think we give you some color on page 16 on expenses on certain things that are one-time in nature, for instance, that are \u201819 or might be one-time or less frequent like the ground lease revaluation that\u2019s other expenses and the HOA kind of holiday. That was in other expenses that you wouldn\u2019t expect necessarily to recur. We\u2019re not giving you 2020 guidance. I got to say that in 2020, there might be some things that pop up that could go the other way. You heard us and others talk about the benefit in real estate taxes that we saw in Seattle this year that may not repeat itself, but we\u2019re very focused on making sure that we can manage those expense line items to be lowest possible growth rate overall. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second thing is Mark appreciate your upfront comments on the California rent control and New York. As you look to next year, it seems like Albany is taking that CPI plus rent cap to try and have a market rate rent control. So, which would not have, as best as we can see from the press reports, would not have all the flexibility that California has, what do you guys see differently in how you and the industry would approach Albany in the upcoming legislative year versus what happened in the prior year? Mark Parrell : Well, I\u2019ll start by saying I don\u2019t think anyone on this call, myself included, is in any position to predict what a politician will do or what the political system will do and how many or elsewhere. So it\u2019s hard to say. I\u2019ve read the same things you read, Alex, and we\u2019re working with our advocates in New York. So what I\u2019d say is I think there needs to be more dialog than maybe there has been so far. And we\u2019re working to do that. I know that the people we have on the ground talk a lot to policy makers, but I\u2019m not sure those channels couldn\u2019t be opened even wider. I do know that there has been some conversations even from the mayor\u2019s office about whether the first stage of rent control is working very well in New York. I think there is already things that make you wonder about whether this is such a great idea. And I would hope the policymakers would take that into account before considering or passing new rules on top of the already onerous regulations passed back in June. So what I hope for the most is to have the industry have a seat at the table for that dialog and that\u2019s what as a member of the industry and as a big owner in New York, we\u2019ll push for. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Hardik Goel from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead, sir. Hardik Goel : Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions. We\u2019ve heard a lot about cost controls in terms of \u2013 on the personnel side, where you essentially have less employees. Maybe you pay the remaining once more and you essentially are leveraging technology to achieve that. Can you talk a little bit about how much of that you\u2019re doing and what you see the future of that over the next two years? How does that play out? Mark Parrell : Yes. So I think I said over the course of the next couple of quarters, I think you\u2019ll see us talk more specifically around some of the financial kind of impact from some of these initiatives, I would say, sitting here right now, it\u2019s pretty clear that several of these initiatives combined are ultimately going to create some operating efficiencies in the portfolio. For us the goal of doing all these initiatives has really been around better experiences for our employees and residents and we expect that the efficiencies that we gain on the operation staff that will impact staffing level will really just happen through attrition in the workplace. The initiatives on the sales side of the business are already starting to show time save, definitely offering our customers flexibility and convenience. And on the service side of the business, right now our expectation is that our dependency and reliance on contractors and overtime that we pay out should start to be reduced over time. So I think it\u2019s clear in the next couple of quarters, we\u2019ll start putting some more financial numbers in front of you guys, but over the course of the next couple of years, the operating efficiencies will start to manifest themselves through leveraging this technology. Hardik Goel : And just a quick one on utilities as well, which line items will this effect overall, I guess, and then a little bit on utilities, are you guys doing anything pertaining to that? Michael Manelis : Yes, so just to make sure I understood the question, kind of what\u2019s driving the utility cost in the quarter and year-to-date, and that\u2019s mostly, it\u2019s been pretty self-contained in the gas and electric component, most of the increase, we are slightly higher in the third quarter, was coming from some garbage and trash-related expenses, which is predominantly from the West Coast, from a couple of markets in the West Coast. Hardik Goel : Got it. And then I meant to ask which line items are most affected by the efficiency savings over the next two years that you mentioned? Mark Parrell : Yes, the \u2013 what the payroll obviously which Mike alluded to, but also repairs and maintenance is where you tend to see most of that contract labor flow through. And oftentimes that\u2019s a line item where you might see some of that as we \u2013 on the service side. I don\u2019t know Michael if you have anything else? Michael Manelis : Yes, I think, look, some of the, some of the initiatives around the smart home technology or even smart thermostats being put in the unit can help reduce some of the vacant electric cost associated with it. But those aren\u2019t significant dollars for us that are going to really equate to anything meaningful for us to be talking about. Mark Parrell : Yes, on the utility side, because you did call that out specifically, we\u2019ve done almost every LED-type lighting project we can do, so some of the low hanging, really all the low hanging fruit is gone. We have a lot of solar installs and some of which are actually going to be pushed into the beginning of next year that we\u2019re going to do in this quarter and the fourth quarter that stuff will benefit us to. But, yes, on the utility side, it\u2019s this sort of the sustainability thought process we have that \u2013 we just put a new report out on our ESG efforts. There is a lot in there about it. That\u2019s going to help us on the utility items, but it takes some time to kind of get through the numbers, but again I think we\u2019ve done all the easy stuff and now we\u2019re onto things like solar and co-gen and other things that will save us money and be good for the environment but take a little time to manifest. Hardik Goel : Thanks guys. That\u2019s all. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Wes Golladay : Yes, good morning guys. So you sold about $1 billion this year that \u2013 that\u2019s the plan and you\u2019re still have some non-core assets with you, but you did mention potentially using leverage to buy assets. I\u2019m trying to get the magnitude, if you will be a net acquirer next year. Is it a fair to assume that you\u2019ve done the heavy lifting on some of the non-core assets this year? Mark Parrell : Yes, I mean we \u2013 have a $40 billion portfolio, there is always an asset or two that is becoming obsolete for whatever reason, where the neighborhoods change, the dynamics change, there will always be an asset here or there that need selling, but it isn\u2019t significant. It is like we have this incredible burden where we\u2019re tearing a whole market, we don\u2019t want to own or anything like that, that\u2019s just not the case anymore, and you can evidence that most by seeing our little dilution in this case, in this year none that we have because we are basically buying and selling in the same markets and just buying newer product versus the older. So next year, will we buy more than we sell, we will see and that mostly depends on the competition, it isn\u2019t that we\u2019ve been hesitant to start raising debt by assets. It\u2019s just that we haven\u2019t been able to find enough good product at prices we were willing to pay in order to fire up that acquisition machine. So it\u2019s really more about our spend in the next two or three months, seeing if there is enough in the pipeline for us to really buy in order to to kind of have a net acquisition year in 2020. Wes Golladay : Okay. And then looking at the turnover, that just continues to trend lower, kind of surprised a lot of people, and when I look to next year. I\u2019m thinking about the smart home technology is going to be more robust next year, more people going to adopt it, does that actually drive turnover lower, is that too aggressive of an assumption on my part? Mark Parrell : No, I don\u2019t think the correlation there, I think lifestyle changes of our resident base is really, the probably most significant catalyst to the reduction in turnover, and we\u2019ve proven time and time again that turnover is correlated to resident satisfaction. So as we keep focused on increasing our overall resident satisfaction, we should still continue to see reductions in turnover. How much lower it can go. I don\u2019t know, I would think that it stabilizes here at some point, but I guess that every quarter we continue to inch that down a little bit. Wes Golladay : Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thanks. And our next question comes from Nick Joseph again with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Bilerman : Hi, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Nick. Mark, you mentioned Prop 10, 2.0, you had I think it was $4.5 million last year that you spent on that campaign, you added that back to normalized FFO, even though I would argue you\u2019re in the business and you spend money to advocate for your business, that\u2019s the business cost, putting that part aside because that\u2019s in the past. I would assume your costs are going to continue as rent control initiatives and just going to happen next year in California, and it\u2019s going to go across the US, how should we think about the money you\u2019re spending. How much it could be, how you\u2019re going to treat it? Mark Parrell : Yes, good question. Thank you for that. Michael. So you can see on Page 25 that the amount we spent this year on advocacy is $200,000 versus the number last year that I think approached 5 actually at the end of the day, mostly California related. So there is great variability, it\u2019s like a lawsuit. We sometimes settle a lawsuit and get money, which we then settle a lawsuit and pay money, they\u2019re not important to the core operation of the business. Michael Bilerman : I don\u2019t think I can get any money back on this one. Mark Parrell : Yes. So what I tell you is we\u2019ll do and we promise to do is be very clear , like we are on Page 25, we\u2019ll tell you what we\u2019re spending, whether it\u2019s in or out of norm FFO will convene our Chief Accounting Officer, our very capable CFO, and our audit committee and we\u2019ll decide what we\u2019re going to do next year, but I agree with you that at some point if you have large recurring every year costs, then they are just part of your business. For us this has been unusual. Last year was, I don\u2019t remember any year like that. And I\u2019ve been at the company for 20 plus years, so that\u2019s when we call out something is when it\u2019s unusual and it was not affecting the run rate of our cash flows. Michael Bilerman : Thank you. And then if we think about the acquisitions and you\u2019ve been fortunate that you\u2019ve been able to match them perfectly with dispose and not have any dilution, which you had in years past, where you\u2019ve been calling higher cap rate assets, you mentioned early on about IRRs and thinking about rent control and how the deal that you bought are going to pencil in the high sixes versus in the sevens. How \u2013 what is in that IRR analysis over the next, let\u2019s call it five years from a fundamental standpoint there \u2013 we are obviously extraordinary long in this economic cycle. There is a significant amount of caution flags that are out there right now from an economic and a global perspective, are you modeling any sort of slowdown in that IRR and when are you doing it? Mark Parrell : So the way we think about, and I\u2019m going to use rent growth as revenue growth as the kind of biggest thing you are thinking about biggest variable. We have a good sense of what will happen in the next year. We know the markets we\u2019re going into, we know if there is a bunch of supply. We know if the prior owner was running asset well where the rents are too low, maybe they have been, they have, nominally high rents but high concessions. So we understand the existing rent roll in the market and then you\u2019ll get a number that\u2019s very specific as a result of that. So I\u2019m looking for example at our underwriting for Denver and our number for rent growth in year one is slightly negative. And it\u2019s slightly negative because we understand what\u2019s going on in that submarket and we have priced the deal to that. Over the long haul we pick a number that we think is appropriate. We don\u2019t pro forma year that\u2019s going to be negative, even though we know there is one there, just like we don\u2019t perform a year when it\u2019s 6%, even though we know there is going to be one of those. So in the near term, what we do Michael is we really think hard about what\u2019s going on and for the first year or two we feel pretty good about that on revenue growth after that we\u2019re putting an average out there, it\u2019s usually somewhere around 3 and saying to ourselves, there\u2019ll be years where it will be way low on that number, of years we will be way high and this will be a good average. And then we spent a whole bunch of time thinking about the cap rate at the end of the deal, and that\u2019s kind of the thought process that the team has. Michael Bilerman : And then I wanted to come back on your financing comment about maybe using some additional leverage. Do you think the debt markets not only availability of capital but the cost of that capital being so low, both on the secured and the unsecured side is perhaps driving on economic decisions that could come back and bite us from a basis perspective? Mark Parrell : That we are talking about us specifically being EQR I\u2019d say no, with the thought being that we\u2019re talking about relatively small amounts of money relative to the size of the company. Do I think there is excesses in the sovereign debt market or in with the central banks are doing, I think there\u2019s a lot of people to think that\u2019s true. I mean there\u2019s a lot of interesting and unusual things going on in those markets in the short-term funding market, things like that, but I don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re putting the company in any risk adding several hundreds of million dollars of debt to the balance sheet and adding hundreds of millions dollars of high-quality assets, that feels fine to me. Michael Bilerman : I said now whether there was expenses that you see in the apartment acquisition market given the amount of cheap financing available where you\u2019re seeing assets trade at levels that perhaps you would want to own them long term? Mark Parrell : I wonder if some of that isn\u2019t the equity, are you really on the debt, so the debt\u2019s been cheap for a while. This isn\u2019t like a new factor really. I think what really is going on as you got a hard asset class with stable to good operating performance, good demographics that\u2019s easy to understand and we are to some extent a safety, then we are also a substitute for fixed income, I think a lot of people look at apartments and the private side is all over it because they feel all those things. So I think a lot of the positive you see, that may be why development capital is a little less available equity because that is perceived correctly, is ,considerably more risky whereas buying a stabilized asset in a great market at a 4.5% cap rate feels like a good trade not going to turn out bad. Michael Bilerman : Yes, great. Thanks for the color and see you in a few weeks. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Haendel Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Haendel Juste : Hey, there. So had a few questions, first, I guess given the low cap rate decided and challenge of putting capital to work for new acquisitions here in your core markets, what\u2019s your current view today or more recently with the Board on expanding the portfolio year to perhaps some vibrant secondary markets that offer higher returns that not too dissimilar from say a Denver maybe Austin, Portland and Salt Lake and then what type of yield IRR premium would you require to go into those markets versus say your more established core markets? Mark Parrell : Great question. Thank you for that. Yes, we had our regularly scheduled board meeting a few weeks ago and at that meeting, we talked about market allocations and I think you\u2019ve been around a while, so you know in our book we have page usually it\u2019s page 16 of our investor book, where we talk about other markets \u2013 our markets and other markets and the relative attractiveness. And the example you gave of Austin, Austin screens particularly well. The issue to date has been that Austin trades as good or better at the moment as some of our other primary markets do and we\u2019re not sure that makes a lot of sense and that IRR is defensible. So would we go into another market, is that possible? Sure, that\u2019s possible. But in the near-term what we are trying to do is do things that makes sense both on the real estate side but are good on the FFO side and the buy \u2013 there is an asset that traded recently in Austin \u2013 it was a good asset that\u2019s a sub-4 cap rate, I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s a good idea from our perspective. So for us it\u2019s both having these great demand and good supply statistics like Austin has, especially on the demand side, but it\u2019s also just a matter of price, there may be markets we\u2019d like to be, and they\u2019re just not price for our entry as they\u2019re just too expensive. So I can\u2019t give you an exact premium, but there is a cost to us going into a new market because until we have a good enough size. We don\u2019t have as good a coverage. We don\u2019t have the same number of people in that market doing maintenance items for example and oversight. We have people on-site doing their jobs, but just we don\u2019t have an on-site human resources manager for Denver, those sorts of things. There\u2019s travel costs and stuff. And then as you build it out, you have those people on site. So I would tell you that you don\u2019t need to just get to be a market with a little higher cap rate for it to be more compelling. Haendel Juste : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks Mark. And then I guess the perceptual potential risk of going maybe back into the market that you exited in 2015. I believe I know that you had a largely suburban older portfolio and I think you\u2019re a bit more concentrated or focused on more urban locations, but just curious how that weighs into the consideration as well. Mark Parrell : Well, I mean the good news is this team has been here a long time. Some of us are newer to our jobs, but none of us are new to the company. So we know that thought process, we understand it, some of the markets we exited, many of them we are delighted to have exited. We were in Austin, many, many years ago with a very different suburban portfolio and to me that\u2019s an argument like Denver. We didn\u2019t leave the Denver market we left did specific Denver assets we own. So I feel like, if the markets changed, circumstances have changed, and we can explain it to ourselves to the Board and to you, then we go back into that market. And if we can\u2019t, we wouldn\u2019t and nothing will change our minds on that. Haendel Juste : Okay. And then one last one, I think you mentioned $500 million of potential new development starts on an annual basis at least near term. I guess I\u2019m curious, should we assume these will be all within the existing core markets. And then given the development challenges, the rising costs, yield compression you outlined earlier, how confident are you of meeting that that figure and then should we be expecting similar low 5 stabilized yield on that? Thank you. Mark Parrell : Well, next year, we will see whether we get to $500 million and it was more of a spend number. So we have existing assets under construction, especially the Alcot deal in Boston that are going to be a significant amount of cash next year as we get closer to completing it. So whether we start exactly $500 million or not, I\u2019m not sure, but we expect to start modestly more development than we have seen this year and last year, but I can tell you it won\u2019t be outside our markets. It\u2019s not a great idea from our point of view to have our first asset in the new market, be a development deal, we would rather buy some stabilized assets, make sure we understand what\u2019s going on and then there is a development opportunity like Denver, we\u2019re open for business to do development for sure in that market, but I don\u2019t expect us to enter a new market by doing development. Haendel Juste : Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from John Guinee with Stifel. Please go ahead. Aaron Wolf : Hey, all, Good morning. This is Aaron Wolf on for John Guinee. I just have one \u2013 you provided a great amount of commentary on your development pipeline in your project list and you may have covered this and I apologize if you have, does the 489,000 unit for the Edgemore project, does that include capitalized ground lease? Mark Parrell : So it does include a ground lease. But let me give you some statistics. Just bear with me as I find the correct pile here but I gave you a cap rate I believe was about 5.9% cap rate, and that cap rate would go down to a 5.1% if we had bought the land. So going to take that question a different way, imagine we had bought the land, the per unit cost of the land would have been about 100,000 a unit in our estimation. And that would have driven down the yield from 5.9% to 5.1%. So that gives you an idea. We always think about ground leases AS financing tools. So the answer is yes. It\u2019s in our numbers and it\u2019s correctly accounted for as a GAAP matter. But when we think about it at the investment side, we\u2019re thinking about it is a financing and making sure we\u2019re comfortable that if we had bought the land in FY, it\u2019s still a good transaction. Aaron Wolf : Okay, great. Thank you. That was my one question. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we have no additional questions at this time. Mark Parrell : Thank you very much. We appreciate everyone sticking with us on the call and we will see you around the conference circuit. Operator : Thank you all for your attention. This concludes today\u2019s conference.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead. Marty McKenna : Good morning and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's fourth quarter and full year 2019 results and outlook for 2020. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now, I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Thank you, Marty. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm going to start by giving a quick overview of our business and investment activities. And then I will turn the call over to Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer for a discussion of our 2019 operating results, and 2020 revenue guidance, as well as giving you some detail on the exciting operational initiatives that we are pursuing. Then we'll pass the call over to Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer who will give you color on 2020 expense and normalized funds from operations guidance and a bit about our balance sheet activities. 2019 was a very good year for Equity Residential. We saw continued strong demand delivering our well-located urban and dense suburban properties in the nine metros in which we do business. And our excellent customer service led to record levels of customer satisfaction and resident retention. A big thank you to all my colleagues at Equity Residential for delighting our customers every day and for working together as one team. As we predicted the fourth quarter 2019 reverted to the normal lower seasonal demand that is common at the end of each year. Slightly weaker conditions than projected led us to slightly underperform on same-store revenue versus our October guidance, but still perform at the top end of our expectations from the beginning of 2019. And we saw our normalized funds from operations increase in 2019 by an impressive 7.4% exceeding our expectations as we continue to produce strong reliable growth. 2020 looks to us to be more of the same, a slow but consistently growing economy and continuing positive demographics leading to good demand and to steady revenue growth albeit at a somewhat lower overall level than in 2019. We expect the East Coast markets to continue to improve on a relative basis and overall, we expect the average revenue performance difference between the East Coast and West Coast markets to be only about 25 basis points in 2020. Except for New York, we see supply is similar to or slightly higher in our markets in 2020 versus 2019. In New York, supply across the area in which we operate has been declining in the last two years and we would expect it to fall by a further 40% in 2020. In fact in Manhattan, where we have 70% of our New York metro revenue, we see fewer than 1,000 market rate units being delivered in 2020. Also as we discussed on prior calls, we will be facing a headwind of 20 basis points or so from new rent control regulations in California and in New York. On the innovation front, we're very excited about the benefits to revenue and expense as well as the customer satisfaction that can be gained from the continued rollout of the various initiatives that Michael will discuss. These benefits will be modest in 2020 but we believe will accelerate and compound over time. Switching to investments, we had a busy 2019. As we have stated previously, increased demand for our apartment assets has led to cap rate compression between newer and older properties. This led us in turn to accelerate the sale of some of our older lower return properties and to reinvest that capital in newer properties that we think will provide considerably better long-term returns. We were particularly successful at doing this in 2019. We have reallocated $1.1 billion of capital from assets that were on average 35 years old to assets that were on average two years old and incurred no cap rate dilution in doing so. We think owning these newer higher growth assets will benefit our NFFO growth and because we expect much lower capital spending at these newer assets the level of our capitalized expenditures which is already much lower as a percentage of revenues compared to most of our peers should be lower and our unlevered IRRs higher going forward. The fourth quarter was a microcosm of this as we sold two older suburban Washington D.C. assets that averaged 41 years old for total proceeds of $374 million at a 4.8% cap rate and acquired $370 million in newer assets one in Central Seattle one in suburban Seattle and one in suburban Washington D.C. that were on average one-year-old at a 4.8% cap rate. We also acquired more than we sold in 2019 and have guided for the same outcome in 2020. While cap rates and IRRs are certainly lower than historical averages so is our cost of capital. The spread between the unlevered IRR we can achieve on new deals we see for sale versus our weighted average cost of capital is relatively high. We intend to finance this increase in our assets with a combination of new debt and net cash flow. Our strong balance sheet gives us ample capacity to do so, but as always, we'll be prudent in managing our balance sheet. Switching to new development, the equity capital availability story since early 2019 has somewhat improved for large established developers while smaller, local, and regional developers continue to work hard to put their equity capital stacks together. We have been pursuing a few of these opportunities with smaller developers as joint ventures. And believe that investing our capital in shovel-ready deals with sound deal structures that provide some protection to our capital is a good way to source new properties while managing the risk inherent in development. You should expect us to announce new joint venture development activity in 2020, as well as new wholly owned development deals including some lucrative density plays, where we are taking down a low density portion of an existing property and replacing it with higher density housing. We expect 2020 development starts of $500 million, $650 million, depending on construction timing and development spending in 2020 of about $300 million. We continue to believe that development makes sense in selective locations in our markets where acquiring new properties is difficult and where our existing properties trade materially over replacement cost. We have no imperative to start a certain amount of development per year. And we will always compare development opportunities to the market to acquire existing assets. And look for the best risk-adjusted return opportunity for our capital. We will also seek to keep the amount of capital we expect to spend on development in any one year, roughly equal to our annual net cash flow and expected new debt capacity. Finally, let me finish by talking about our dividend. We believe one good way to use our growing cash flow to reward our shareholders. In 2020, we plan to increase our common share dividend by 6.2%. Now I'll hand the call over to Michael Manelis. Michael Manelis : Thanks Mark. So today I'm going to provide a quick recap of 2019 performance, share insights into our 2020 same-store revenue guidance, discuss what we are seeing today across our markets. And end with updates on our current operating initiative. Let me start by acknowledging the dedication and hard work of our employees in 2019. For the full year, we reported 3.2% same-store revenue growth. Highlights for the year include 96.4% occupancy, which was 20 basis points higher than 2018. Every market except for San Francisco was able to grow occupancy, on a year-over-year basis. Strong achieved renewal rate increases of 4.9% for the year, which was the same as 2018. Turnover declined by nearly 200 basis points to 49.5% for the year, which is the lowest full year reported turnover in the history of our company. Strong absorption of elevated supply in many of our markets delivered slightly more pricing power than we originally expected at the beginning of 2019 and resulted in 0.3% new lease change for the year, which was a 50 basis point improvement from 2018.  And finally, in addition to the areas just mentioned, the company continued its trend of record-breaking customer satisfaction and online reputation scores. This strong positive feedback from our customer and the progress being made on innovation, we shared in the release, demonstrates that we have some of the best employees in the industry, who are passionate about meeting the ever-changing needs of our prospects and residents. Looking back, it is clear that the fourth quarter of 2019 reflected a return to seasonal softness, which in some markets was greater than expected. And this was very different than the upward acceleration felt in the fourth quarter of 2018. The good news is that the portfolio demonstrated resilience. And we are starting 2020, well positioned to achieve our revenue expectation. Moving into 2020, our same-store revenue growth guidance range is between 2.3% and 3.3%. At the midpoint of 2.8%, we are 40 basis points lower than our 2019 actual results. This guidance assumes a similar occupancy of 96.4%, an improvement in new lease change of 30 basis points to a positive 0.6% for the year. And anticipated renewal rates achieved of 4.7%, which is 20 basis points less than 2019. Recall that these renewal rates will be impacted by recent rent regulations that we have discussed on prior calls. In 2020 supply will be down considerably in New York, up in Boston and L.A. and mostly comparable in our other market, year-over-year. We expect consistent demand that should aid in the absorption of this new supply. By market, New York, D.C. and Seattle are expected to deliver better revenue growth this year, while Boston, San Francisco and Southern California markets will be worse. So let me take a minute to reconcile the 40 basis point decline at the midpoint and the expected same-store revenue growth for 2020. As stated in our last call, rent control in both the California and New York markets is expected to negatively impact our overall same-store revenue results, by approximately 20 basis points this year. The remaining 20 basis points comes mostly from the incremental impact from competitive supply in our market and a view that it will be difficult in 2020 to replicate the occupancy gains we had in 2019, given the current high occupancy of the portfolio. Attaining the upper end of our guidance range of 3.3% will be mostly dependent on rate, meaning that in order to achieve this outcome we will need to have strong pricing power on new leases early in the year and through the peak leasing season. The bottom end of our revenue guidance range of 2.3% would likely result from declines in occupancy, due to softening in overall demand. Sitting here today the portfolio is 96.3% occupied the same as what it was at this time last year. Achieved renewal increases for January and February are expected to be around 4.2%. So now, let's move on to the individual markets beginning with Boston. So Boston continues to be a power center of the knowledge economy. Overall demand drivers are strong and the long-term outlook for this market remains positive. Our 2019 results of 4.0% revenue growth, includes gains in occupancy of 30 basis points, and strong growth from other income, mainly parking that will be difficult to repeat this year. Boston is expected to deliver more units as we are tracking close to 6,000 new units in 2020 compared to 1,700 in 2019. These new units will be concentrated in the CBD and Seaport and are likely to have more of a direct impact on our portfolio performance. Our expectations for the market is about 3% revenue growth, and assume occupancy remains flat at 96.2%. We anticipate less growth from renewals and new leases given the increased levels of competitive new supply. And we expect the first half of the year performance to be stronger than the second half given the strong embedded growth that we have entering the year. New York had a busy year-end with plenty of press surrounding growing tech expansion in the market and significant office leasing. This activity is fueling continued diversification of the local economy, which we view as a long-term positive. As 2019 progressed, operating fundamentals continued to improve in this market. We finished the fourth quarter with seasonal softness that resulted in a concessionary environment that was greater than we expected. However, during the month of January, operating fundamentals have improved each consecutive week, reducing concession use and improving occupants. For 2020, we are forecasting better revenue growth, which should be a little north of 2.5%. Our guidance assumes slight improvements in occupancy and renewal rates achieved, but the majority of growth is expected to come from gains in new leases as pricing power returns to the market given the almost complete lack of new supply that Mark mentioned earlier. Overall, demand for our product remained strong with foot traffic or tours in January being up year-over-year. The portfolio is 96.7% occupied today, and we are well positioned to seize improving market condition. Washington D.C. continued to demonstrate strength in operating performance despite the 12,000 plus deliveries that we have become accustomed to in this market. Last year, at this time, we were discussing the longest government shutdown on record. But today both Congress and the President have signed a spending bill, which includes over $50 billion in new spending. This budget clarity and increased spending is expected to positively impact the region and continue to aid the absorption of 12,000 plus additional units expected in 2020. Northern Virginia continues to be the economic driver for the region, having captured seven out of every 10 jobs created in the last 12 months in the area. Our portfolio results in D.C. validate this as same-store revenue growth in the district, which was near 1% while the Northern Virginia submarkets with approximately 50% of our revenue averaged above 3% growth in the year. Overall, the market delivered 2.3% revenue growth in 2019. Our forecast for 2020 is a little better than 2.5% revenue growth with improved results mostly driven by stronger embedded growth starting the year as operating assumptions for occupancy, new lease change and achieved renewal increases are expected to be relatively flat year-over-year. Moving over to the West Coast. Seattle finished 2019 strong with 3.4% full year revenue growth driven by 70 basis point gain in occupancy and consistent improvement in pricing power and revenue results throughout the year. We did experience concentrated supply pressure on the east side that we expect to continue into the first half of this year. Supply in the CBD, which was not particularly impactful in 2019 will return in 2020 during the back half of the year. This provides an opportunity to establish rate growth early in the year and through the peak leasing season. It's also possible that some of these units get pushed into 2021. If this were to happen, it could strengthen our anticipated results this year. Overall, we expect 2020 to deliver better revenue growth of around 4% and with similar occupancy, slight improvements to achieved renewal rates, and the majority of growth coming from gains in new leases as we capitalize on the current and near-term pricing power in the portfolio. San Francisco delivered 3.7% revenue growth in 2019, which was driven by gains made early in the year offset by declining occupancy in the second half of the year that resulted in a full year occupancy of 95.9%. As we discussed on the last call, we saw a deceleration in this market as the year progressed and that trend continued through the fourth quarter. The East Bay with approximately 40% of our 2019 new supply and approximately 20% of our San Francisco revenue was our lowest performing submarket in both the quarter and full year with revenue growth below 2%. All of our other submarkets produced growth above 3% for both the quarter and full year. New supply in 2020 will be relatively flat year-over-year with the concentration of competitive supply impacting the downtown San Francisco SoMa and South Bay submarkets the most. Overall, we expect 2020 to have lower revenue growth of around 3% as we continue to work through the impact of supply and the impact of new rent regulation. Our guidance begins with around 50 basis points of lower embedded growth than last year; occupancy at 96.4%, which is a 50 basis point improvement over 2019; similar new lease change; and a decline in achieved renewal increase. As we sit here today, leasing velocity in San Francisco is good. Rates are growing, foot traffic is up and occupancy has recovered to 96.4%, which is the same place we were at last year at this time. This market has the critical mass of tech talent. And while we expect some softness when supply is concentrated around us, the long-term drivers for this market remain very strong. Los Angeles finished the year with 3.7% revenue growth, which was driven by strong performance in the first half of the year. As noted on our prior call, deceleration occurred in the second half of the year as deliveries came online and put pricing pressure on a number of our core submarkets. For 2020, we expect Los Angeles to be our most challenged market as we continue to deal with the elevated new supply, implementations of new rent regulation and restrictions on short-term lease pricing put in place as a result of the wildfires. We expect to deliver lower same-store revenue growth in 2020 of around 2.5% with slightly lower occupancy, modest gains in new lease change that are back half-loaded and a decline in achieved renewal rate growth. As we sit here today, we are 96.2% occupied in L.A. And while our foot traffic is on par with last year, we feel pricing pressure. One of the bright spots continues to be West L.A., which is home to the changing dynamics of Los Angeles as Silicon Beach flourishes and online media content takes hold in the entertainment sector, leading to good absorption of the new product in this submarket. Our other Southern California markets, both Orange County and San Diego, are expected to deliver strong but lower same-store revenue growth in 2020, averaging around 3% with similar occupancy, slight gains in new lease change that are back half-loaded given the anticipated pricing pressure early in the year and a decline in overall renewal rate growth based on the impact of new rent regulation. In both Irvine and Downtown San Diego, we expect to feel the impacts from new supply delivered in areas that will be very competitive to our community. With both markets sitting at 97% occupancy, we are well positioned heading into a competitive environment. Moving on to operating initiatives, as you know, we have long been focused on running a best-in-class operating platform, which included development of some of the original, pricing, renewal and online leasing tool widely used in the business today. As our industry undergoes another phase of significant change, we continue to identify opportunities to utilize new technology that will shape how we interact with our customers and manage our day-to-day operations going forward. Our focus is to harvest technology that best serves our customers, provides enhanced career opportunities for our employees and creates efficiencies in our platform. We are currently in the process of executing a number of initiatives that fall into three primary areas : smart home technology, sales-focused improvements, and service enhancement. And while there are many opportunities in the industry to roll out new system, we are taking a methodical approach to implement only the tools and processes that we believe will create the best long-term benefit and value in our portfolio. So let's review some of the initiatives in these three areas. So, first smart home technology. We have already installed over 2,100 units, and thus far have had success in generating a rent premium of $30 per month on these units. During 2020, we plan to install smart home technology in an additional 10,000 apartment units at an average cost of approximately $1,000 per unit. We are focusing on properties where we think this technology will yield the greatest immediate result. This technology includes smart lock, a thermostat, a light switch, water leak sensors, and a hub that connects it all. Moving to sales, our focus continues to be on improving the customer experience by leveraging technology, automation and centralization to meet their ever changing needs. We currently have deployed Ella, our AI-enabled sales tool to over 200 communities and we will be fully deployed by the end of March. We have over 60 communities offering self-guided tours and have been receiving very positive feedback from both our customers and our employees on this new process. During 2020, we will continue to roll out the self-guided tour option for the majority of our communities, and we will be deploying a new mobile customer relationship management platform to improve efficiencies in the sales process and provide flexibility to our sales team. Finally on the service side of the business, we are now fully deployed on our new mobile service platform, which means our service teams now use a mobile app to manage all of their work in real time. This allows us to use shared resources across assets and improve service personnel utilization by having specialists become focused on being subject matter experts. This will deliver operating expense savings through less dependence on overtime and contractor use as well as improve the customer experience through real-time notification and resolution of maintenance requests. Overall, the impact of these initiatives, are expected to deliver approximately $15 million in annual NOI contribution once fully deployed. It will take into 2021 to fully realize that contribution, but we have included approximately $5 million of net NOI benefit in our 2020 guidance. We believe these early stage initiatives will provide a foundation upon, which to continue to build our platform. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer. Bob Garechana : Thanks Michael. This morning I'll discuss our 2020 guidance assumptions for same-store expenses and normalized FFO along with a couple of brief remarks on our balance sheet and capital markets activities. First a couple of quick highlights on 2019. Our same-store revenue grew 3.2%, expenses grew 3.7% and NOI grew 3%, which is mostly in line with our expectations from the third quarter call. For normalized FFO, we delivered $0.91 per share in the quarter, which is $0.03 higher than the midpoint of our expectation. This outperformance was primarily driven by higher than anticipated NOI from higher than expected acquisition activity during the quarter, lower than anticipated overhead stemming from lower than expected employee benefit costs that also impacted same-store payroll expenses described on page 16 of the release and better than forecasted interest expense. Michael provided color on 2019 same-store revenues, so let me briefly touch upon 2019 same-store expenses. Full year same-store expenses grew 3.7% in 2019 compared to our forecast of 3.8%. Notably, real estate taxes ended the year higher than anticipated at 4.3% as we had fewer successful deals conclude during the fourth quarter than we had expected. This was offset by lower anticipated payroll expense, which grew only 80 basis points for the full year. This outperformance was due to the significant improvements in employee benefit costs like the ones impacting overhead that I just discussed. Now moving to 2020 guidance. For the full year 2020, we expect same-store expense growth between 3% and 4%. This forecast incorporates the anticipated 2020 savings from the initiatives that Michael outlined earlier. Let me walk you through the major categories and drivers of our forecasted growth. At a little over 40% of overall same-store expenses, property taxes drive a significant portion of expense growth. We currently anticipate growth between 3.75% and 4.75%, driven by the continued burn-off of the 421a tax abatements in some of our New York properties, a slight decline in forecasted year-over-year appeals activity and a relatively healthy increase anticipated in Seattle. For the full year 2019, same-store property taxes declined in Seattle as the state legislature took on more of the educational funding burden from local municipality. We've not incorporated this recurring in 2020 for our guidance. In on-site payroll, our next largest category we anticipate growth between 2.25% and 3.25% for 2020. This expense really consists of two key drivers; direct salaries, bonus and commissions for our on-site staff and employee benefit costs like medical insurance. We expect to see a benefit in this first driver from the operating efficiencies that Michael and his team are working on. This will mute total payroll growth for the year. As a result, nearly all of the 2.75% expected growth in payroll is coming from anticipated increases in medical insurance and other employee benefits. Finally, our last two major categories, utilities and repairs and maintenance. Each of these line items individually contributes about 13% to total expense. Each is also expected to grow between 2.5% and 3.5% in 2020. Drivers of utility growth are expected to remain the same in 2020 as they were in 2019. While we continue to benefit from relatively low commodity prices and efficient usage given our sustainability investments, we see price pressure in the service-related categories like trash and sewer particularly on the West Coast, which we expect to continue. On repairs and maintenance, we expect to see another relatively modest growth year. This line item has seen significant pressure from increases in minimum wages across nearly all the states we operate in driving up costs for contract labor. However, improvements in the utilization of our workforce, stemming from service mobility and other initiatives Michael discussed are offsetting this growth. Our guidance range for normalized FFO in 2020 is $3.59 per share to $3.69 per share. Major drivers for the change between our 2019 normalized FFO of $3.49 per share and the midpoint of $3.64 from our 2020 guidance include an $0.11 contribution from same-store NOI and our same-store properties based on the revenue and expense assumptions that Michael and I just outlined; a $0.01 year-over-year contribution from lease-up NOI with our lease-up properties generating $10 million in NOI for 2020; a $0.07 contribution from lower anticipated interest expense predominantly driven by the favorable refinancing activity we undertook in 2019 that I'll discuss in a moment; offset by $0.01 per share related to higher anticipated overhead, which we define as G&A and property management expense; and finally an additional $0.03 offset related to other items net, which mostly consists of other individually immaterial items like interest and other income. A final note on the balance sheet. Our financial position remains the strongest in the company's history and one of the strongest in the REIT industry. 2019 was a busy year on the balance sheet front having issued nearly $1.5 billion in debt including the lowest yielding 10-year unsecured bond in REIT's history; upsized and extended our revolving credit facility with incredible support from our banking partners and with market-leading terms; and finally increased the size of our commercial paper program to $1 billion. We also paid off approximately $1.8 billion in debt during the year including the early redemption of the 2020 maturity described in last night's release. These favorable financing activities are the drivers in year-over-year interest savings I discussed earlier. For 2020, we anticipate issuing between $600 million and $1 billion in debt capital terming out debt that is currently on our commercial paper program or revolving line of credit. These outstandings are mostly the results of our net investment activity in 2019 and our early retirement of 2020 maturity. We have very manageable development spend that we would anticipate being funded from free cash flow. With that I'll turn it back to the operator for the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Jeff Spector : Good morning. Congratulations on a great 2019. Just one or two questions on 2020 and 2020 comments. Can you talk about the latest concession environment, I guess, in markets like San Francisco or other markets where you described some heavier supply in the first half of the year? Because I'm trying to connect -- I heard a comment that the first half should be better than the second half, but I didn't know if that was just in general. But it seems like at the same time there were some comments that supply is currently pressuring or there's some heavy supply pressure in select markets in the first half? Michael Manelis : Yes, sure. Jeff, good morning. This is Michael. So I guess first I'll just say at the top of the house so concessions for us in our portfolio we tend to be more of a net effective shop. So even though I described the concessionary environment and it did cause us to use a little bit more concessions than we expected, on the quarter we were talking about $500,000 -- $600,000 in total concession used across the portfolio with the large majority of that kind of still centered in the New York market. So I think when we think about markets like San Francisco or anywhere that we have this concentration of new supply we expect to see concessions in the new supply typically offering between anywhere between four and six weeks. And we monitor those concessions that they're offering in the marketplace as an indicator of their own velocity. So when we see concessions on new supply in San Francisco start picking up to eight weeks or they start going longer that's an indication that overall their velocity is kind of feeling some pressure. And that's what we're kind of -- we're responding to in the fourth quarter. As I think about the first half of the year what we've seen is a lot of the concessions that we saw in pockets of New York and some pockets of San Francisco on the East Bay start to abate, meaning it's still present at those lease-up properties, but the stabilized assets around them are starting to use less and less concessions. And I've seen this now for the last four weeks we've been monitoring this as we progress through 2020. So I think what you're going to see as demand continues to grow throughout the year like it normally does in a seasonal year, you should expect to see less and less concessions. And our portfolio for the full year we would expect concession use to be very comparable to 2019. And I think just given what we just saw in fourth quarter probably will be more front half-loaded than back half-loaded. Jeff Spector : Okay great. That's helpful. It sounds like some positive news on the concessions at least so far this year. Can you talked about strength in foot traffic demand remained strong. Can you talk a little bit more about move-outs and anything new move-outs to home buying? Michael Manelis : Sure. So I would just -- I guess I would say with turnover being down almost 200 basis points for the year the absolute number of move-outs is less on a year-over-year basis. But when you start to look at those that did move out and the reasons they cite for move out we really saw no change across any of the reasons. Home buying runs roughly about 12.5% of the reasons cited for those people that are moving out to buy home. And we saw no change across any of the markets that we're operating in. Jeff Spector : Okay great. Because we noticed that some of the homebuilders have cited success with entry-level homes. And just confirm if you're seeing any change? It sounds like not. Great. Thanks for your comments today. Michael Manelis : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Nick Joseph : Thanks. How does the $5 million net benefit to same-store NOI in 2020 from the operating initiatives break down between the revenue benefit and the expense savings? And then what's the impact on both same-store growth rates this year? Bob Garechana : Joe, I guess, I would tell you it's about probably a 50-50 split when you look at the $5 million between revenue and expense. And on the revenue side it's probably going to equate to roughly 10 basis points of improvement across the various markets that we're doing those operating initiatives in. Nick Joseph : Thanks. And then Mark you talked about the cap rate compression between older and younger assets. What percentage of your portfolio or GAV would you consider older and that you could ultimately trade for newer assets if the opportunity exists? Mark Parrell : Yes, Nick, thanks for that question. We don't have any more in the portfolio a lot of must-sell, if any must-sell assets. And some of the older assets are some of our best assets in places like New York and Boston. So it isn't always age but I did use that in my remarks as an indicator of quality to some extent. I don't think there's a grand reservoir we have of capital. There are a few assets in every market when you have a $40 billion portfolio that have become less competitive and we'll look to sell those, especially when cap rates are this close between value-add and brand new product and we'll look to trade out to the new products. So I don't have an exact percentage but it's a low single-digit sort of number. And then it's \u2013 for us it's just opportunistic. When we see cap rates like this so close together we're going to take advantage. Nick Joseph : Excellent. Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : Thanks. So just going back to the guidance, appreciate all the building blocks you gave on \u2013 to explain why there's a modest slowdown in same-store revenue growth. Yes, I think you said, you're assuming better new lease pricing and stable occupancy. So to me that seems like a kind of bullish indicator for the business that would suggest you guys could even push pricing even more. So I guess what I'm wondering is, are you just being conservative in how you're forecasting your pricing this year? Or is there something else that's creating this dynamic that's not allowing you to push pricing even more? Michael Manelis : Well, I guess \u2013 this is Michael. So I guess I would just start by saying I think the 30 basis point expectation in growth and new lease change is demonstrating that we're experiencing or we expect to experience growth. It's really just coming off of the deceleration in the back half of 2019 and the fact that now we're expecting kind of to recover and looking at where the supply is on us we think some of that recovery is going to be more back half-loaded. So I think when you think about our guidance you've got to look at the full range that we have out there and understand that. Sure in markets like New York, if we continue to see pricing power return to us quickly and in front of the leasing season, we'll outperform that expectation. But I don't think it's prudent for us to sit here and think about all of the markets with all of the supply that we have coming at us to think that we're going to outperform those expectations early in the year. Nick Yulico : Okay. That's helpful. I guess just following up on that. I mean, if I look at the track record of the company in the last three years you gave initial guidance on the same-store revenue that you ended up hitting pretty much close to the top end for three years in a row. And so I guess what I'm wondering is what dynamic is different this year, as we think about the starting point versus prior years? I think last year you got \u2013 you and a lot of the industry got an occupancy benefit. This year it sounds like it's more of a better pricing dynamic? And I guess I'm just wondering what's \u2013 is one more difficult than the other to achieve? Mark Parrell : Well, Nick it's Mark. Each year it's kind of a different year and stands alone. I mean our process this year in 2020 wasn't very different than 2019 or 2018. We asked the field for specific feedback on what they see maybe there's a lease-up right next door or they have renovations in the property and we'll get a little boost there. We also look at the top and think about macroeconomic conditions. As Michael said, this year again we feel well positioned going into the year. We worry about the supply, particularly in some of our bigger markets. We did see some weakness as we've said in New York, late in 2019. So that positions us where we ended up going out with guidance. Could we do better? We certainly hope so. But looking at it, we try to balance things out and don't assume that everything will go perfectly well. Nick Yulico : All right. Thanks, Mark. Mark Parrell : Thanks, Nick. Operator : Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. John Pawlowski : Thank you. Maybe just a quick follow-up to the first question. Michael, did I hear it right that concessions in the Bay Area on lease-ups pushed to eight weeks free in the fourth quarter. I'm curious, if they've gotten any better or worse in January? Michael Manelis : Yes. So I mean, I think they've stayed pretty consistent and stable. When I say weeks that's on longer-term leases. So we saw them kind of move around with the four to six on just conventional terms. And then they started offering some longer terms. And kind of we're just monitoring that. I mean, primarily now you got Oakland where you've got more assets coming online. So it's a great kind of pocket of assets for us to watch the concessionary environment and it's been fairly stable. They have not been volatile in what they've been doing but they clearly started going long and offering a little bit higher concession rates for those longer term leases and that's what we've been watching. John Pawlowski : Okay. And then turning to New York. Curious from your lens, how the kind of organic operating backdrop is going to be different these next few years after the rent control package was implemented or the rent control laws change. I'm curious if you're seeing anything right now in terms of market turnover your game plan on marketing expenses kind of vacancy and any early indicators that could play out in the next two or three years in New York that you're seeing happen today? Mark Parrell : John before I let Michael launch into giving you that detail which is very important I think the overall comment about New York and what we've all read about just increased demand that's coming all of these tech relocations into New York, particularly in the west side of New York, where we have a lot of assets is very encouraging to us. Now when they announce something it doesn't happen right that moment that they hire. But we see that. And in fact, our research is indicating research, we've seen is indicating there's actually more tech jobs in the New York metro area than there is in the Bay Area now. So, we're excited to be involved in that. And again, you're right we have to adjust to these rules. But the overall demand drivers in New York in the next few years feel really good to us. Michael Manelis : Yes. And I'd say, right now, we have not noticed any material change from the -- looking at the rent stay properties versus kind of the market rate units or market rate buildings. So, we're not seeing any differentiation on turnover. We're not seeing kind of from an operation standpoint, anything yet that has manifested itself where we're going to be running those buildings differently. Mark Parrell : Yes, and I was suggesting John I think on prior calls and our meetings that, we thought turnover might start to decline in New York because, with lower renewal increases, there'd be more reason for people to stay. Obviously, we only have a couple of quarter's sample size. We really haven't seen that yet. We're looking more carefully at our capital spending in New York, but we have a high-end clientele, so continue to maintain those assets well. So, I don't have anything to add there in terms of -- again it seems to us intuitive that turnover should get even lower and the term of our residents should get even longer, but we haven't quite seen that yet. John Pawlowski : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. I guess two questions. When you sort of think about New York, how does sort of the Jersey kind of Gold Coast play into sort of your outlook in terms of the rent growth that you've got in that part of the region versus maybe the city? Mark Parrell : Yes. So, I mean for '19, it was pretty comparable, right, when you just think about the various submarkets between Manhattan, Brooklyn as well as the Hudson Waterfront. And I think going forward, we would expect kind of hopefully start to see pricing power return to Manhattan and see some market rate growth that could accelerate that beyond what we're going to see kind of from the Hudson Waterfront. But right now, they're pretty packed like really close together from a result standpoint and our expectations. But I think, you will see Manhattan start to differentiate itself over time. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And then I guess second question. Maybe Mark, as you think about new development, it looked like you were able to buy some relatively new assets and call it the high 4s. And you're thinking about some new development starts. Where are those yields on the new starts? And how has that spread contracted and how narrow would it need to be for you sort of not to pursue new developments? Mark Parrell : Yes, that's a great question. So, we are just constantly Steve comparing -- because, we are not committed to being either a developer or an acquirer. We can do either or both. And we constantly compare the two to see if it's sort of on a risk-adjusted basis, you'd rather just buy the asset. Even if it's at a slight premium to replacement cost because there's a fair amount of risk in development. As we look at our development pipe now, you heard me say, we're going to refill it. Some of those are special events like we own the land already and we have an apartment building on it. We're doing a density play and so those sorts of things especially because on a GAAP basis, you have a very low basis in the land. You bought it many years ago. Those returns look great. And even when you market to market, they look really good. So, I'd tell you, in some cases for us, we're building all the way down the yields in the middle 4s. There's a tower we're thinking of building on the West Coast that's more in that range. And our thought process is its just terrific product. We like the per unit cost. We like the location and because we're not a merchant builder where we have to hit the cycle perfect. And if we don't hit it when we get the CFO in a year or two, we can get pushed out of the deal. I mean, we can kind of build for the long run. So, I think I'd tell you, I don't worry about spreads altogether. I worry about just are we getting the right location, do we have exposure in that submarket, can I buy in that submarket, those sorts of things and then do I like the propound kind of cost and how are we funding it? Steve Sakwa : Well, maybe to be a little more specific on the -- I think you said, you were going to start a couple of hundred million dollars in 2020? Mark Parrell : Sure. So we've got about 500 or 600 maybe 650 will start, Steve. And so, I would say, when you talk about these JV deals that we've spoken about, those deals tend to have yields around 5% on current rents, so current construction costs and current rents. The tower I'm talking about is, call it a 4.6% yield on current. And again, we're still in the underwriting process, so that may change a little bit. But we feel again that we like the location and we like how that feels. And then you've got a few of these other density plays that we're doing that I would say, when you mark the land to market, feel like 5% plays or so on current rents. So that gives you a general feel. Steve Sakwa : Okay. Great. Thanks. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley. Richard Hill : Hey guys. Thanks for taking my call. A quick question. Look, it resonates with me about maybe occupancy being stable. And so, I think that new and renewal leases and the disclosure that you gave on leasing pricing statistics are increasingly important in 2020. So, I'm wondering if you can maybe give us a little bit of color. Do you -- as revenue growth maybe decelerates a little bit compared to last year, do you think that's equally from new and renewal leases? Are you seeing more strength in new or -- and/or renewal leases or vice versa? Michael Manelis : Well, I guess I would say we gave the top level guidance that would suggest that renewals are going to grow 20 basis points lower than the industry down to 4.7% versus the 4.9% and we're improving new lease change in the overall guidance. So it's our expectation that you're going to continue to see this kind of convergence between new lease rate and renewal, so our expectation is we should start to demonstrate better new lease rate growth and kind of take the impact on the renewal mostly from the rent regulation. Richard Hill : Got it. Understood. That's helpful. And look 4Q 2019 seemed weak relative to the other quarters. You obviously noted that that was a return to seasonality. We had also heard some color that that was a broad trend. Do you expect 4Q is going forward to be equally as weak? Or I guess what really drove that weakness compared to the strength that you saw in 2018? Michael Manelis : Yeah. I guess, I don't know if I would say that it is weak. I look back almost like in 2017, we've gone back over multiple years to understand just rent seasonality, demand seasonality. And really what we saw in 2019 is it kind of just returned back to the norm. And 2018 was the anomaly where you just had that strengthening of demand in that kind of later part of the year that allowed you to accelerate when otherwise you wouldn't expect to. So I think embedded in our normal guidance process right now for 2019 is normal seasonal declines in the fourth quarter -- for 2020 normal seasonal declines for that quarter. Richard Hill : Got it. Okay. That's helpful guys. That's it for me. Operator : Our next question comes from Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates. Hardik Goel : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question today. Bob, if you could talk about a little bit the expense guidance, how those ranges work and maybe talk about the big components like real estate taxes, and what you guys are underwriting in your guidance for that? Bob Garechana : Yeah. So I mentioned in my prepared remarks there's really four large categories and real estate taxes is by far the largest. So that's at 40%. At the moment we're expecting 3.75% growth to 4.75% growth, so very similar year at the midpoint relative to 2019. The drivers of that continue to be a lot of the same conversation. So that's the 421a tax abatement growth that we're experiencing in New York. But also what's unique in 2020 relative to 2019 and you've heard other companies talk about this in 2019 is that we saw a good meaningful benefit in Seattle, wherein Seattle absolute real estate tax growth was actually negative in 2019, and we're not expecting that or forecasting that to be the case in 2020. On payroll, it's -- which is the next largest category, it's 2.25% to 3.25%. I talked in the prepared remarks about some of the drivers there. It really is mostly the medical benefit piece. The initiatives that Michael is putting in place is really helping us curtail some of that salary growth that we would otherwise have expected. And then finally on the third piece, which is really -- or the third and fourth piece, which is utilities and repairs and maintenance we're expecting normal growth 2.5% to 3.5%. Hardik Goel : Got it. And just one quick follow-up. If you could share kind of the blended rent growth you're getting in early in the first quarter relative to last year that would be really helpful. Bob Garechana : So I don't have that. I have for the renewals that we're kind of expecting to be around 4.2%. I'd tell you from a new lease change standpoint, we kind of wait until quarter-end is to really look at that. But just based on where rents are moving each and every week in our asking rents, I could tell that we're seeing improvement in those stats as well. Hardik Goel : Well, I guess, how about just January-over-January the new lease rate, because I know you mentioned every week was improving. So I'm just trying to get a sense for how much the improvement is? Bob Garechana : Sure. Just from a base rent or amenitized rent standpoint, our rents today are up 2.5% over the exact same time -- exact same week last year. And they've been improving each and every week. Hardik Goel : That's great. Bob Garechana : Yeah. Hardik Goel : Okay. That's really helpful. Operator : Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Haendel St. Juste: Hey, good morning. So, I guess, the call wouldn't be complete if there weren't any questions on the regulatory environment. So I guess I could help on that front. My question specifically is on SB 50, the California law that would allow for denser apartment buildup around public transportation areas in the state. I guess, I'm curious first of all if you expect that to be ratified on January 31. And if so how might that impact your viewer plans for California development? Mark Parrell : Hey, Haendel, it's Mark. Thanks for continuing the tradition. We appreciate that. Comment on SB 50, I think you described it pretty accurately. We're not sure of its prospects. We certainly are a big supporters of it both the company and the industry. I think having additional density near transit hubs and having that state-mandated is a good idea. I know the sponsor that measures made some changes to try and get support. And having talked just recently to our experts on this, I can tell you we hope it passes. We aren't sure it will get through the state House. And we're sort of waiting to see what will happen in the next few days as you said, but certainly think it's a good idea. We don't think it will add to the road traffic much by putting it near transit hubs. And if you want to make an impact, and you want to have three million or 3.5 million more housing units in New York as a lot of policymakers have said in that state, you need to start somewhere and starting with putting more density near transit hubs is a good idea. Haendel St. Juste: Appreciate that. Thank you. Bob Garechana : Thank you. Haendel St. Juste: One more. I appreciate the comments earlier on your portfolio recycling plans selling older and buying younger. But curious perhaps where you're looking at -- and I know it might be a bit unfair on you, but just curious about the opportunity set in front of you and how much of the volume that you're contemplating this year that could come from new markets. You talked about perhaps Austin a quarter or so ago? And then maybe some comments on how the underwriting in some of those newer non-coastal markets would compare from an initial cap rate and IRR perspective versus your coastal markets? Thanks. Bob Garechana : All right. A lot of questions bundled up into there. But -- so our average age of our assets is about 18 years old. So the portfolio is relatively young. And then again there is some SKU in some of our markets like Boston, New York where we own some great assets, but they're older properties. So I would -- like I said to the prior question say there's always a handful of assets that probably should be sold and we do have a handful of those. And especially when you get the opportunity to do that in a non-diluted basis, you should do that. And we hit the gas on that and we hope to do more of the same. Based on what we heard coming out of National Multi Housing conference last week there seems to be a lot of demand. Some of the deals we're talking about are deals where the buyer may have a value-add thought process so we'll push that. In terms of just moving capital around a little, which I'll take is the middle part of your question we've talked in prior calls about having a little bit less exposure in Washington D.C. maybe shifting some of that capital to Denver. That's really a reaction to what has been consistent high levels of supply in Washington D.C. That said, we're both a buyer and developer in that market and have announced both in 2019 and expect to do the same next year. We'll keep freshening up the portfolio there. But it is an area where we think the supply is pretty continuous. We'd like to own more in Boston and Seattle and we've said that on the call and maybe you'll see us lighten our load a little in California that fund those. In terms of new markets, we do like Austin. There has to be an entry point that makes sense. Obviously when you do an investment pro forma, you start with your price at the beginning. And the price at the beginning for Austin is quite dear. There are assets that are we understand to be trading inside a four cap rate on current rents. That's pretty tight for us to buy into a new market. So there's a lot of markets, several markets that we're monitoring. And I guess I'd say in terms of how the underwriting will differ, well there's probably if you're being really honest some additional property management costs and running an asset away from your main platform. And we often take that into account. And then the rest of it's market specific, how do you feel about cap rates, how do you feel about values, how do you feel about growth rates. We had an advantage with Denver because we knew it so well from being in the market for most of our existence. But these other markets Austin included we were in as well and have a recollection of how that market cycles. So I'll pause there. I don't know if I addressed what you wanted to address. Haendel St. Juste: No, it's very helpful. But I guess ultimately I'm curious what type of IRR spread would you be willing to accept understanding that some of those markets might have in the case of Austin a lower initial yield, but perhaps operating efficiencies, maybe even better growth given some of the overall in migration job growth et cetera. So just curious how you think about the acceptable IRR spread perhaps versus the coast. Mark Parrell : Yes, great question. So in our investor materials this heat map we've had for a long time which tends to be on page 16 of our materials for some reason every year has all the factors we take into account. I don't know that a market needs to have a higher IRR or a much higher IRR just for us to move into it. Maybe it has other benefits regulatory and diversification benefits for example. So I guess I'd say you've got to underwrite your starting point. And Austin is a pretty expensive starting point. And then maybe to your point, you make it up because you think growth there is better than some of your other markets. Then you've got to think about how is it going to feel in 10 years with the amount of supply in market like that gets. So again, I wish I could be absolutely clear about what that margin needs to be. But there are markets we go into that don't need to do a lot better on an IRR basis, they just need to provide some benefits overall in terms of diversification of risk and their IRRs can be comparable to those in our main markets. Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. All right. Thank you, Mark. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you. Thank you, and good morning out there. So just following up from Haendel actually on two fronts. So first Mark, just continuing on the markets, if you look across -- I mean a lot of the markets have converged around similar NOIs and similar cap rates, you guys obviously a number of years ago made an effort to focus on certain key gateway markets. And now you're sort of going back and looking at -- you invested in Denver, you talked about Austin. Do you feel that this convergence that we're seeing is going to sustain where your -- the idea to go to the certain gateway coastal markets may not be appropriate for the next decade? Or you think this convergence is just temporary and the markets ultimately will go back to the ones that you guys have really focused on over the past number of years? Mark Parrell : I get -- that is just an outstanding question and something we think can talk about a lot. You should always be thoughtful about your markets, while you were there before, while you're there now. So I appreciate the question. I think one of the things we think about is you've got such a wall of money going into the apartment industry is it distorting perceptions of returns and risk? Are there markets that are frankly overvalued relative to what they normally and probably should trade for on a go-forward basis? So we look at the nine metros we're in now and say we like our customer, we like our CapEx spending, we like in most cycles the supply picture in these markets and nothing there has changed for us. To me, it's more like are there other new markets, where we can find our customer in abundance, someone Alex who is relatively affluent, renter by choice, who wants to live in an urban-dense suburban setting with a lot of walk-to amenities. Where we find those people, we will go to them if the competition makes sense, the supply and demand picture makes sense. So I guess that's the way I think about it is are there cities that are sort of being promoted into the ranks or the markets in which we do business as opposed to saying all markets are equal. I think some markets are definitively not equal. And what's going on is just the wall of capital is moving cap rates and stuff to a convergence point and I don't necessarily believe that's permanent. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then the next question is on the regulatory front, yes switching coasts here in New York. I'm sure you guys have seen the press that Albany wants to go back even tighten the CapEx restrictions on rent control units even more to talk of a market-wide CPI plus cap. I think I read 1.5, I don't know where. Ultimately they have it. But given what happened lessons learned from 2018, how are you guys thinking about approaching this year's Albany session which I think expires in -- or ends in June? Mark Parrell : Yes. Well, I think in terms of recent good news the Governor and the State of the State Address didn't mention affordable housing. Our sense from what we've heard from some of our context is that, many in the legislature would like to see these new rules play out a bit and see what the impact is, before adding even more to it. We'd hope that would be the case. And obviously it's difficult for us whether you're in New York or you're here in Chicago to predict the action of politicians. But we're working hard through our trade association. I think they've got real new energy and focus on this issue and having the right kinds of conversations to just educate people because this is going to do and already is doing the exact opposite of what they intend, it's going to cause disinvestment in housing, less supply and make the city less of the energetic place we all want it to be. And that's just what's going to happen and is happening. And I just would say I think the trade association is even better positioned this year than they were before. But what exactly happens, it remains to be seen. Alexander Goldfarb : Thanks Mark. Mark Parrell : Thanks Alex. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Rob Stevenson : Good morning guys. So turnover was 49.5% I think in 2019. What's the expectation for 2020? And how much of the 200 or so basis point decline that you guys talked about earlier what's the benefit to earnings from that given those spread between new and renewal leases? Michael Manelis : So this is Michael. I'll start by saying I think our expectations for the year is very similar. We're not expecting it to continue to go down. But we don't anticipate kind of some reversal in the trend and all of a sudden see a spike in turnover. As far as the contribution goes, clearly if renewals were producing a 49% and you had some subset of your resident -- more residents renewing with you that contribution was boosting the revenue lift for the year versus replacing them and absorbing the vacancy as well as kind of the new lease change at 30 bps. I don't have a quantified number, but I do know that lower turnover at higher renewal rates is a positive. Rob Stevenson : Okay. And then what's driving the gap between NAREIT and normalized FFO guidance? I think it's like $0.02? Bob Garechana : Yes. So there's -- you can kind of see that on Page 30 of the release there's two items that are forecasted. There's $0.01 associated with write-off of pursuit costs. And then there's another $0.01 of other miscellaneous items that includes advocacy costs which we had in historical periods etcetera. So those are the two main drivers. Rob Stevenson : Okay. Thanks, guys. Bob Garechana : Okay. Thanks. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Guinee with Stifel. John Guinee : John Guinee. Thank you. Big picture question. It looks like at the midpoint almost half of your FFO growth is coming from interest savings $0.07 a share $27 million in interest cost reduction. Should this make us nervous, one? And two the end result is you basically are getting about 2.3% FFO growth from everything else while your midpoint of your same-store NOI growth is 2.5%, which seems a little unusual -- that 2.5% same-store NOI growth translates to a 2.3% FFO growth ex the interest cost savings. Any thoughts? Mark Parrell : Yes. John, I'm going to start, it's Mark. What happened in the prior year 2019 influences the numbers in 2020. So in 2019 we acquired things early in the year and we sold late. This year you're going to see -- we have a number of assets lined up for disposition that are going to occur relatively early in the year. So even though we're a net buyer and that is going to fuel FFO growth in future years this year some of that -- like the math you're doing is absolutely right. There should be a bigger -- your fundamental growth on NOI is in that 2.5% right? Your numbers should be higher on NFFO, but you're getting a little dilution from transactions. And I think we pointed that out in the release you're getting a little bit of a headwind from transactions that is going to offset some of that benefit. The interest benefit I'll tell you just -- we continue to be able to borrow cheaper. I mean that's all very real. And I'm not sure why that's concerning in any regard. I mean the company's balance sheet is really strong and the percentage fixed the float is sensible and we have great access to all forms of capital. So I'm not $0.07 to me is good money and it's something we've executed on before. Michael Manelis : So the vast majority of that $0.07 too John just so you know is -- so we're not changing the profile of the overall credit metrics. We'd expect the credit metrics at the end of 2020 to be very similar to 2019 on kind of all regards. So very healthy very strong. And the bulk of that gain if you will is already locked in by having paid off debt that was in -- five nano coupons with new long-term debt that's in the 2.5% to 3% range. John Guinee : No, thank you. The obvious issue is that you're benefiting a lot from paying off above market debt and borrowing at market. So my question really is how much longer can that last? Is there still a lot of -- debt that on the balance sheet? Michael Manelis : Yes. So if you look at page 18 there -- we disclosed for you in each of the maturity buckets what our weighted average coupons are. And you can see in kind of 2021 4.64% as an example. To give you a point of reference, if we were to issue a 10-year unsecured bond today I would expect that to be at 2.5% or lower. So there is still a fair bit of runway going forward. Certainly, a longer runway than we had anticipated a few years ago because we didn't anticipate rates continuing to be this low for this long, but there is still some favorable refinancing opportunities which we've taken advantage of in the past and we would expect to take advantage of in the future. John Guinee : Great. Thank you very much. Thank you. Michael Manelis : Hey. Thanks, John. Operator : I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mark Parrell for closing remarks. Mark Parrell : Thank you all for your time today and your interest in Equity Residential. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference.

At this time, I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Please go ahead, sir. Marty McKenna : Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential\u2019s First Quarter 2020 Results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. I want to begin today by giving a big thank you to my Equity Residential colleagues for their dedication to serving our 150,000 residents during this difficult time. Whether working on-site performing essential maintenance or concierge duties, whether you\u2019re engaging remotely with prospects using our new touchless leasing process, or whether you are working from home in the many corporate roles that make Equity Residential hum, you are keeping our company rolling. So thank you very much Equity Nation for your amazing work. Now turning to our business. The best way I can describe it in the last seven weeks is resilient. In April, we collected in our residential business about 97% of the cash that we would usually collect. While no part of our country\u2019s economy will be immune from the coming recession, we feel that our portfolio of properties, populated with residents having average annual household incomes of $164,000 and often employed in technology and other knowledge industries, will fare relatively well. Our operations team has also shown resiliency. When the pandemic hit in full force in mid-March, Michael Manelis and his team quickly pivoted, and over a few week period, adjusted our leasing and service operations dramatically. On the leasing side, Michael and his team were able to quickly create a touchless process that made our customers comfortable to lease. And on the service side, we focused on essential maintenance tasks and cleanliness, which helped our existing residents feel safe and comfortable living with us through this pandemic. Michael will give you more details about all of this in a minute. When the lockdowns were initially announced, we saw our leasing activity decline significantly, but demand has since picked up, as we noted in the release. We see our recent pickup in demand as a further indication that our properties and markets will remain attractive places to live for our target demographic. All in all, we think our people and our properties have been resilient, with the capital R going through this crisis. We do fully acknowledge that challenging days remain ahead and are taking steps to weather the storm and prepare for the post-pandemic world. We have further fortified our already strong balance sheet, as Bob Garechana will describe in a moment. We are also preparing in earnest for our properties to operate with fuller staffing as lockdowns across the country are relaxed. We will keep in mind the safety of our employees and residents as we reengineer our business. Equity Residential has historically performed well in these downturns, and we would expect this to be no exception. We are optimistic that we will perform well operationally given these circumstances and that we will find opportunities to add high-quality assets for our platform as the economy works its way through this recession. Finally, we did withdraw guidance in the release. We are unable to estimate with precision the continuing impact of the pandemic and the timing and character of the reopening process on our business. It makes it impossible for us to give you the high-quality estimates of where our business might go in the near-term that you\u2019re used to receiving. We did provide a significant amount of information on April\u2019s preliminary results and hope that is helpful. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Michael. Michael Manelis : Thanks, Mark. So today, I\u2019m going to provide a quick recap of operations over the past 45 days. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were off to a very good start for the year. Our occupancy was ahead of expectations, and we were well positioned for the primary leasing season. And then COVID-19 hit, causing us to adjust our operations to this new unprecedented challenge. Let me start by acknowledging the dedication and hard work of our employees during these unprecedented times. They inspire me with their ability to quickly adjust operations while keeping an intense focus on our customers, properties, themselves and their families. Shelter-in-place was mandated by governors in our markets in early to mid-March. For us, this means that our more than 150,000 residents began staying at home 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In response to shelter-in-place, we made some key changes to our operations. We closed our common area amenities, we increased cleaning frequency, we quickly modified our website and our artificial intelligent E-Lead responses to pivot the entire sales process to virtual leasing. Capturing video content and conducting the sales process via video conversations allowed the business to continue uninterrupted. This process would have normally taken us several months to accomplish. We also locked the office doors to encourage social distancing but kept the business running as we implemented shift rotations of the staff to reduce the number of employees coming to the property. When we look back to March 15, we saw our traffic and applications drop 50% compared to the same period in 2019. That being said, we continued to receive over 375 new applications each week through the end of March, which we see as a validation of the new leasing process. With reduced traffic coming through the front door, our focus has been on keeping current residents in place. We are currently offering residents the option to renew without increase. Overall, retention in April and May has improved as we are now renewing in the mid to upper 60% range, which is a 300 basis point improvement from last April and an almost 800 basis point improvement from last May. New York is having the strongest renewal percents of nearly 70% for March, April and May. Despite this good retention, our overall occupancy since March 31 has declined by 130 basis points. We expect the occupancy impact to be the most pronounced in the second quarter, setting a new base from which we hope it will improve as shelter-in-place orders are lifted. Let me share some color on the performance in April. At the beginning of April, we began to notice an improvement in demand, with both traffic and leasing activity rebounding by almost 30% and actually now trending on par with last year. In fact, we had over 900 applications last week, which is a significant improvement compared to the 375 that we were averaging in late March and very encouraging for us. Given the activity in the last 45 days, we would like to see that volume grow even more to help offset the lower demand that we experienced in March and to match the increased volume of applications that we usually get in May. What is clear is that our high-quality, well-located portfolio continues to attract future residents. While the pandemic is certainly a deterrent, people have life reasons that require them to move like changes in jobs or partners. On Page 13, we reported the first quarter and included April monthly pricing statistics by market. I would remind everybody this is only one month of data, and that longer periods of time are usually required to show definitive trends. Mark mentioned the strength and quality of our resident base. This is evident by the fact that we received a very strong 97% of the cash collections in April relative to our March collections. This resilience delivered 5.4% delinquency, which is quite good given these unprecedented circumstances. Notably, Seattle and Denver were our markets with the lowest delinquency at below 3% and Los Angeles was the laggard close to 8%. The rest of our markets were centered around the average. We have also taken a cut at looking at property type. And in most of our markets, our garden-style or more suburban assets have experienced higher delinquency than our mid-rise, high-rise more urban locations. As we move through the continued disruptions created by COVID-19, we remain strategic in our pricing efforts. Sitting here today, our base rents are down 4% compared to the same week last year. Let me give you some color on notable markets. Overall, our strongest market is Seattle, which has shown great resilience, with limited delinquency and the best overall revenue growth performance in the portfolio. New York is a bit of a mixed story. On one hand, it has the strongest retention of any market, but it has also not shown the signs of recovery that other markets have with traffic and applications. Long-term, we expect the New York market to benefit from low new supply and technology firms expanding their presence in the city. We are hoping leasing activity will improve as the hard-hit New York area gets through the worst of the pandemic. Finally, we started 2020 anticipating that Los Angeles would have a very challenging year given the new supply pressure. COVID will definitely add to this. Despite recent improvements in applications, we expect this market to remain challenged with meaningful pricing pressure that will continue as supply is delivered. So where do we go from here? Well, we\u2019re now in the early stages of preparing our properties for the new normal. We expect things to shift over time. Right now, the new normal is going to be focused on increased deep cleaning standards at the properties; adjustments to the layout of common areas, including fitness and lounges to accommodate social distancing; balancing the capabilities of virtual leasing with the need to engage with our customers; and ultimately, staggering work shifts to ensure that we limit the number of employees on-site at any given time. These are challenging times, but our business is resilient, and our teams are positioned to deliver. Thank you. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bob. Bob Garechana : Thanks, Michael. This morning, I\u2019ll highlight our enhanced disclosure from last night\u2019s release, give a brief update on non-residential operations and end with our incredibly well-positioned balance sheet. Starting with our new disclosures. We\u2019ve modified our disclosures to help better present our business and where it stands today. We do so by providing April operational and collection statistics, by breaking out our same-store performance between residential and non-residential, a practice that we would expect to continue as the performance from our main residential business, which makes up approximately 96% of total revenues, is likely to diverge meaningfully in the upcoming quarters for our much smaller non-residential business. This includes modifying the schedules on Pages 10 through 12 of the release. And finally, by providing an update on liquidity and balance sheet information. In order to accomplish this, we\u2019ve defined a number of key terms in the back of the release. We hope that these definitions will provide specificity and clarity to our disclosure. Part of the new disclosure includes a breakout of non-residential operations for our same-store portfolio. This is a modest component of our business at 4% of total revenues and consists mostly of ground floor retail and public non-resident parking at our well-located apartment communities. Ground floor retail makes up about two-thirds of this 4% with public non-resident parking making up the rest. As you would suspect, a good portion of the retail tenants that rent our space have been significantly impacted by shelter-in-place orders. This is evidenced by the 58% April collection rate for all retail that we disclosed, which, while certainly below what we would have hoped, may be higher than many other retail landlords. The drugstores, bank branches and national chains that occupy a good portion of these spaces have, for the most part, continued to pay rent, while local small business owners have struggled. With non-resident parking, we\u2019ve seen an approximately 30% decline in parking volume for April, given the lack of public events and increased work-from-home arrangements. We suspect that this may recover as shelter-at-home orders are eventually lifted. Finally, a few highlights on our balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with an incredibly strong net debt to normalized EBITDA of 4.9 times and nearly $1.8 billion in liquidity under our revolving credit facility. Subsequent to quarter end, we improved this already strong position by closing on a very attractively priced 2.6% or $195 million 10-year GSE loan and by closing on the sale of an asset in the San Francisco Bay Area. With these steps, we sit here today with over 84% of our total NOI unencumbered, about $150 million in commercial paper outstanding and readily available liquidity of over $2.2 billion under our revolving credit facility, which does not mature until 2024. This liquidity is more than sufficient to address our modest level of anticipated development spend, minimal debt maturities in 2020 and to address our next significant debt maturity, which isn\u2019t until December of 2021. Our balance sheet is in excellent condition to weather the storm and take advantage of opportunities should they present themselves. With that, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to the operator. Operator : Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll start with Nick Joseph from Citi. Please go ahead. Nick Joseph : Thank you. I hope you guys are doing well. Just \u2013 first on May rent collections, I recognize we\u2019re still very early in the month, but I\u2019m wondering how collections have been thus far? And maybe you can tie it to where you were in March or this time last year. Michael Manelis : So this is Michael. I guess I would just say, so first and foremost, yes, you\u2019re right. This is very early in the month. But right now, looking at kind of how we closed out yesterday, we are identical, like right on par to the way collections kind of played out through the month of April. Nick Joseph : Thanks. And if you think about the delinquency moving up at the end of April, and I recognize there\u2019s always some level of delinquency, it was helpful to put in the March number two. But how do you think about the ability to collect on that rent? And then how are you working with the residents to get repaid? Michael Manelis : Yes. So maybe I\u2019ll start, and then Bob can kind of fill in. So first and foremost, I mean, I think you can see from the release, we\u2019re dealing with about $11 million in total delinquency, and that was above the $5.4 million that we had in the previous month. So the process that we\u2019re going through right now is we\u2019re working through conversations with all of these residents, with both kind of an empathetic mindset as well as an obligation kind of reminder mindset. And that\u2019s a tough balance that our teams are doing, but we\u2019re setting up various payment plans in places, and we\u2019re just documenting kind of the financial hardships that many of our residents have experienced from this. And we\u2019ll be navigating and working through those conversations through the month of May, just like we did in the month of April. Nick Joseph : But how much of that is like building in? And maybe just to frame, it sounds like the 260 basis points from March was totally in line with the historical nature of where you are on a monthly basis in terms of collections, which obviously accelerated in April given the hardships that a lot of individuals are going through. Is there anything in that increased delinquency bucket that is either geography-based, asset type-based? Is there any color that you can give in terms of that amount? And have you already entered into any sort of deferrals on that amount or outside of the collections that you\u2019ve had? Michael Manelis : So I think, first, in the prepared remarks, I kind of identified, right? Seattle and Denver were absolutely the lowest at 3% or below total delinquency. L.A. was the highest at 8%. As far as property types, we definitely saw kind of lower delinquency at the high-rise, kind of mid-rise product versus kind of the more suburban or garden-style. So I think right now, in regard to deferred rent, I mean, the nature of these conversations are all over the place. I mean these are very one-on-one conversations that we\u2019re having. But much of that delinquency or at least the incremental delinquency from hardships is set up in payment plans or set up into deferred rent situations. And I think the varying state of emergency orders that we have around the country are going to dictate when those payment plans are going to allow for payments to reoccur. Mark Parrell : And I just want to add, Nick, it\u2019s Mark. As you think about building delinquency going forward, you also have to think a little bit, we do have significant security deposits that we haven\u2019t applied in any of these analyses. So generally speaking, you take the security deposit when the resident moves out, but that\u2019s a matter of local law. So we do have a significant amount of security deposits against these obligations. Michael has entered into a bunch of payment plans that the company has, and there\u2019ll be more of those. So I don\u2019t disagree that the economy will get worse before it gets better. But I\u2019d also say we do have these other offsets, both on the security deposit side and with these payment plans, and we\u2019ll just have to feel our way through it. Nick Joseph : Right. And your April, that \u2013 with the April numbers that you\u2019re quoting, would you \u2013 outside of that 5-point \u2013 $11 million would you have already deferred a certain amount of your monthly rent that was already due? So effectively, there is more sort of delay in cash collections even outside of the $11 million? Bob Garechana : Yes. It\u2019s Bob. And I\u2019ll give you a little bit of color to that. So if you think about March and kind of the regular or the pre-COVID delinquency levels, it\u2019s very uncommon or would have been very uncommon to have any level of deferral of rental payments. Typically, you would have ended a month at 2% to 3% of delinquency and then through the regular process of having conversations and collecting that rent, et cetera, that would have diminished to the point in time where it converted to a financial statement impact, which would have been write-offs of bad debt, et cetera. And that number would have been something more like 50 basis points of, call it, total income. So very uncommon in this business to have a material amount of delinquency or payment plans, if you will. Obviously, the situation has changed modestly with the COVID-19 and pandemic implications. Michael Manelis : And Nick, I want to answer just precisely, delinquency includes everything, including the payment plan. So that number is all-inclusive as it relates to the residential book. There isn\u2019t \u2013 like, if it\u2019s a payment plan, it isn\u2019t suddenly undelinquent. It remains in our books to link. We just aren\u2019t pursuing the resident, we have a deal with them, but we don\u2019t \u2013 we include that in our number. Nick Joseph : Perfect. Thank you. Michael Manelis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll next go with Rob Stevenson from Janney. Please go ahead. Rob Stevenson : Can you guys talk about what level of extra operating expenses you\u2019re incurring from COVID? And how much of that has been offset by reduced hours for employees and other areas? Michael Manelis : Sure. So maybe \u2013 this is Michael. I\u2019ll start off. I guess I would tell you, to date, we probably have incurred about $0.5 million of expense specific to COVID, and that would include kind of not only the increased cleaning standards that are occurring at our properties, but also some of the personal protection equipment that we\u2019ve been acquiring. And I think some of the offset has been, obviously, we we\u2019re incurring less overtime expense on our payroll. We\u2019re experiencing less turnover expense. But then on the flip side, having all these residents living with us, we\u2019re also having some increased trash expense that\u2019s mitigating some of those offsets. Rob Stevenson : Okay. And if things begin to spool back up in some markets, how much of that do you expect of the expense side to be sticky? And how much of the offsets do you lose as the hours for employees tick back up and other things? I assume that the trash doesn\u2019t go down anytime soon, et cetera. Michael Manelis : Yes, so I mean, I think we\u2019re looking at kind of what it looks like to kind of reopen and what that new normal is going to look and feel like. I think it is clear to expect that we are going to be spending more money on cleaning standards and protocols at our properties. But I think that we\u2019re going to be balancing kind of that out, not only kind of with the labor and the overtime, but trying to figure out more things that we\u2019re going to get done in-house versus relying on contract labor. Mark Parrell : And I\u2019ll just add, I mean, if we\u2019re \u2013 again, we did withdraw guidance. So I know you\u2019re trying to feel your way through that, so we\u2019ll give you a few other building blocks. Our general instinct here is that our expense numbers will be lower this year than we thought, not higher. So these cleanliness and other costs aren\u2019t zero, but they\u2019re not that significant. And the overtime, the less routine maintenance that\u2019s being done because things are being deferred, all of that is more material. And so over time, again, you could have certain events occur in markets, weather-related or otherwise. But absent that, our general sense is that the expenses will remain pretty tight and this is not going to blow a hole in the expense number for us. Rob Stevenson : Okay. And then on the capital side, I mean, how \u2013 I assume that all the dispositions completed year-to-date were under contract before COVID hit. Can you just talk about \u2013 I mean, if you wanted to sell assets today, is there enough demand in pricing to be able \u2013 is that market back to being liquid or people taking a pause there? How are you guys thinking about potentially making acquisitions going forward and also redevelopment spend over the next quarter or two? Mark Parrell : Yes. There isn\u2019t a lot going on right now. I mean, the last seven weeks with the pandemic, again, talking to the brokers, talking to potential sellers, there really isn\u2019t anything institutional grade in our markets that\u2019s priced and closed or is even very far along in that process. So I don\u2019t have any markers there. As you relate to EQR, I mean we\u2019re always out there. We have teams in our markets, and it\u2019s their job to always be looking at purchase opportunities and such. But right now, there\u2019s just not a lot going on. Rob Stevenson : And on redevelopment, are you going to be able to get the returns to warrant the spending in the near-term? Or do you guys put a pause on that for now? Mark Parrell : Yes. Great question. We have a pause on it, but for a little different reason. Our residents don\u2019t really want contractors in the building, our contractors don\u2019t really want to go out right now with the shelter-in-place. So what you\u2019re going to see across our portfolio is a real slowdown in capital spending, including renovation. These projects that we\u2019ve talked about on prior calls, we hope to begin those again. We\u2019ll be thoughtful about whether we can get the rents and all of that. But at this point, really, a lot of this capital spending depends on having people on-site. Those people aren\u2019t willing to come. And frankly, our residents are more comfortable with them not being there, so I think there\u2019s going to be a real slowdown there. Rob Stevenson : How significant have been any of the delays in the development pipeline for those few assets? Mark Parrell : Yes. That\u2019s a great question. It depends on where you are, so I\u2019ll start by saying that. So for example, in Boston, where we\u2019ve got a tower we\u2019re building, the mayor closed construction March 17, and it still hasn\u2019t reopened, and that\u2019s the sort of city of Boston Rule. But outside the City of Boston in some of the suburbs, construction continues. So it\u2019s really place by place across the country. And I\u2019d say there\u2019s more significant delays in places like Boston and New York in terms of places we do business and to a good extent, Seattle. There\u2019s less of a delay in D.C. and Southern California, where things have just kind of continued. And the delays you\u2019ll see in those places are people working in shifts. General contractors saying, you need to split your shifts up, we need more physical distance between workers. And so you\u2019ll see things slow down a little bit because of that. For example, when you look at our numbers and Axio\u2019s numbers for supply, shifting like what happened between our opinion at the end of 2019 and at the end of the first quarter of 2020 as to what 2020 supply would be, and in markets like Boston and New York, those numbers, we think, are going to move down, supply being lower in 2020 by upwards of 20%. In places like Southern California, it\u2019s more nominal, and the same with D.C. So it\u2019s very much a local law thing. Rob Stevenson : Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate the time. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll next go with Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Nick Yulico : Thanks. So appreciate the April data you gave on renewals, new leases in terms of rate growth. I guess from a timing standpoint, I want to be clear on this because I think it can be confusing at times. If you guys reported renewal rates achieved 2.8% in April, you\u2019re saying that \u2013 I think you said that you\u2019re offering zero renewals, flat renewals across the portfolio now. At what point in the year does that sort of 0% renewal rate growth get kind of fully factored into your rent roll? Michael Manelis : Yes. So this is Michael. So I think first and foremost, you got to realize the April numbers that we reported on renewals, many of those offers were generated in January and February. So many of those leases were already executed well before kind of COVID-19 pandemic began. When we started issuing those offers in mid to late March, those are really for kind of May, June and now even July offers that are out there. So I think what you could expect to see is May is going to trend down, probably be somewhere between 50 to 100 basis points positive. And then in June is when I would expect that you\u2019ll start to see us kind of deliver flat on the renewal increase percent. Mark Parrell : And just to add a little to that, we will start to adjust our renewal expectations, our asks, and we\u2019ll try and look at the market and see what we can get done. So as conditions start to normalize, we\u2019ll sort of feel our way through supply and demand conditions, and you will see us increase our renewal asks, I would expect mid to later in the year. Right now, we\u2019re making decisions in some markets as far out as August. So we\u2019ve got to call that Nick, at some point, and make a judgment. Nick Yulico : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And I guess also on the new lease change side, if we look at the April numbers, I don\u2019t know if you have any data you could share on May so far. But I mean, April seems like it\u2019s unusual month, right? You didn\u2019t have as much traffic. So if we\u2019re looking at down almost 2% on new lease growth in April, I guess May shaping out to be a similar number, maybe you could just talk about how we should think about that new lease growth impact. Michael Manelis : Yes. Well, I think in the prepared remarks, I kind of stated that base rents or amenitized rents right now are down about 4% compared to the same week last year. So as you kind of just fast-forward your way through May, you could expect that, that new lease change could deteriorate down to that 4%. But again, the numbers that you\u2019re looking on that release, if you go to the footnote of that, you\u2019ll see that the 12 to 12 are the like term actually improves by about 110 basis points, so it\u2019s actually down negative 80 basis points. So I don\u2019t know exactly where we\u2019ll land because, again, this is kind of a lease-by-lease thing that you work through to see these stats, which is why I always caution everybody from looking at just one month. But I think I\u2019d like to just understand where are my amenitized or asking rents relative to last year, and that\u2019s that kind of down 4% level. Mark Parrell : And I\u2019m just going to take a chance, Nick, to add a little bit to that answer. And that\u2019s we feel and we gave some extra disclosure about, at the moment, demand conditions. We like, on the occupancy side, the momentum we feel like we will pick up. It\u2019s certain \u2013 it\u2019s not certain. We have to see how these unwinds and these various stay-at-home orders go, but we would expect our occupancy to recover. And we feel good about that. And then you have, as Michael said, with the recession, and that will affect new lease and renewal and all the other quotes. But on the occupancy side, I think we\u2019ve shown we\u2019re already having days where we have more move-ins than move-outs. We\u2019re already seeing all that occupancy stuff kind of steady. So as we see these markets open up, our hope is that, again, if it\u2019s done in an orderly fashion, and we don\u2019t slide back into a lockdown again, that we\u2019ll work our way out of occupancy, and then there\u2019ll be just the rate stuff to deal with. So I just want to emphasize, we feel pretty good about demand. Even in the pandemic, we\u2019re seeing good demand for our product. It\u2019s just a matter of figuring out the clearing price at the moment. Nick Yulico : Okay. Yes, that\u2019s helpful, Mark. I guess just one follow-up on occupancy. And I know you guys did talk about second quarter being the biggest occupancy impact in the portfolio. I mean, April versus March, you already lost 130 basis points of physical occupancy. I mean, is it \u2013 is that kind of the brunt of it? Is it going to get worse than that? I mean any idea on occupancy for the second quarter right now? Michael Manelis : Well. And I guess the way to think about is right now is that the fact if our applications like they are right now are on par with last year and my retention continues to improve, it\u2019s already improved. But if it continues to improve, I think you\u2019re going to see occupancy not only stabilized, but possibly start to improve. If our demand continues at this pace and our applications start running above last year with stronger retention, I think you\u2019re going to see this portfolio come back to that 96% level and start kind of optimizing revenue there. But I think it\u2019s still a little bit too early to understand because we really need some of these shelter in places to be lifted to truly understand the longer term kind of demand or impact on traffic for us to kind of optimize revenue offer. Mark Parrell : Yes. And everything Michael said, absolutely agree with, but would add, we don\u2019t really understand the impact of the recession. I mean it is true that 20 million plus jobs are gone. It\u2019s hard for us to understand that impact on rate and on demand without all these stay at home orders being lifted and once that happens we\u2019ll have a better view for you. But yes, certainly our hope that given the strong demand we\u2019ve seen while we\u2019re still in the shutdown, that we have stemmed the sort of occupancy bleed for the most part. And then we\u2019re just going to have to all-figure out what rate is in a recession like this. Nick Yulico : Yes. Okay. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Mark Parrell : Thanks, Nick. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll next go with Rich Hightower from Evercore. Please go ahead. Rich Hightower : Hey, good morning guys. Hope all is well. Mark Parrell : Hey, how are you? Rich Hightower : Yes. Thank you. So just to follow up again on that occupancy question, just to clarify that, that 130 basis point month-over-month loss, were those move outs in April according to sort of normal lease expirations, was it COVID related? What was the sort of composition of the change exactly. If you don\u2019t mind adding a little more color there? Mark Parrell : Yes, yes, no problem. So it\u2019s a little bit of both, right. So I think when March 15, kind of rolls around, everybody that was scheduled to move out for the balance of the year, for the balance of the month based on lease expirations moved out, people that were scheduled to move in, some of those folks canceled, kind of those move-ins are deferred those move-in. And then we had, call it a couple of hundred of our units basically COVID specific reason leave early, early terminations. Rich Hightower : Okay. Mark Parrell : That\u2019s really the impact on the occupancy. Rich Hightower : Yes. Okay. That\u2019s helpful color. And then maybe, obviously tough to predict, but as you apply the experience from maybe 2008, 2009 and the possibility of sort of the trade down or the doubling up effect coming out of a recession, where do you guys, how do you think about your portfolio given it\u2019s predominant Class A white color composition, how do you think about that dynamic with respect to your own portfolio going forward here? Mark Parrell : Yes. Hey Rich, it\u2019s Mark. I start by saying the portfolio is similar but not the same as 2008, 2009, I mean we have a higher-end clientele as you acknowledged in your question. I like the income levels, I like the kind of employment our residents have, it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re immune to the recession that\u2019s coming, but I think there\u2019ll be less effective than some of the folks in hospitality and other industries got laid-off very quickly and suffered unfortunately very quickly in this recession. So I guess we feel now \u2013 I guess we do feel much better about our resident base. We think they\u2019ve both got skills that will mean they\u2019ll be more readily employable. I mean we worry, I think a little bit about portfolios that depend on workers that have been \u2013 often how many of those workers are really getting those jobs back. In our portfolio, we just don\u2019t see that as much at this point. As I mean a few people won\u2019t lose their jobs in our resident base, but we think being tied to technology and some of these knowledge industry jobs is going to mean that our folks will have more employability, less layoffs coming through this recession. Rich Hightower : Okay. Appreciate that. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll next go with John Pawlowski from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. John Pawlowski : Thanks. Good morning. I just want to follow-up with some of the comments in terms of the occupancy floor and application volume picking back up. I\u2019m just trying to wrap my head around what\u2019s the more important leading indicator for what this spring and summer leasing season? As the applications current being flat or traffic, being down 20% and Michael, what kind of weight do you put on traffic versus applications? Just trying to understand what\u2019s more important for us to focus on? Michael Manelis : Well, so I think the improvement in traffic is really telling, right compared to where we were even in the beginning of the month and where we are right now. And then our closing ratios is kind of giving us that sense of this market clearing price. And if I backed up all the way to March, I\u2019ll tell you, I mean we\u2019re looking at how many eyeballs were hitting the website, what was that traffic count looking like? And we were closing 70% to 80% of everybody who expressed interest, so it was not a price issue back then. And right now as you can see, okay, we have an opportunity to kind of make an impact with the traffic improvement that we\u2019re seeing and we\u2019re going to continue to do what we\u2019re doing with promotion base to go forward and try to recover some of what we gave back in the last 45 days. But I think it\u2019s really the improving trends is what you got to focus on. Because again, the peak leasing season is not going to exist like the peak leasing season has in the past. It\u2019s probably going to shift forward a few months or it may just be kind of more dulled throughout the whole thing. We don\u2019t know that yet. So what we\u2019re watching is week-over-week. Are we seeing the improving traffic? Are we seeing the improvement in apps like you would expect to see through a leasing season? And so far that\u2019s what\u2019s been playing out for the last several weeks for us. John Pawlowski : Okay. Bob, on the delinquency side. Thanks for the comments on what\u2019s your typical delinquency rate and then as you work through the payments, what does it all come down to in terms of bad debt, 2% to 3% delinquency, eventually getting down to 50 bps. A market like LA, where there\u2019s an 8% delinquency rate and tenants have a year to pay back rent, with 8% delinquency rate, what\u2019s your reasonable bad debt working assumption for rent you\u2019ll never see? Bob Garechana : I think that\u2019s a hard question to answer in all fairness. We haven\u2019t seen those kinds of levels historically, right. So like I said, this business was very fortunate and has been very fortunate to see very little delinquency historically. So I\u2019m not sure that ratio of that I talked about between 2% to 3% converting itself ultimately to 50 basis points necessarily holds true in the middle of a pandemic. I do think that all the positives that we have in our resident base that Mark outlined in terms of high-quality employment, et cetera, should help in the collections process, but hard to guess any answer to that one right now. John Pawlowski : Okay. Is it fair to say you probably won\u2019t know until 2021 and we won\u2019t see it in the financials until 2021 the net shortfall? Bob Garechana : Yes. I mean my \u2013 and that kind of gets towards the kind of bad debt expense policy or kind of what policy we have in terms of write-offs, et cetera. And I think that\u2019s something that in the second quarter we will evaluate with a lot more detail about at what point do you reserve against some of these outstanding deferral programs and payment programs, because certainly there will be some subset of residents that are subject to a payment program that ultimately don\u2019t pay. That\u2019s something that we\u2019re currently evaluating and currently discussing as we have just simply a lack of historical payment history to understand because of the unprecedented nature. So I think you\u2019re correct in assuming that, it\u2019ll \u2013 that is to be told as how it manifests itself in the financial statements. Michael Manelis : And again, just to add to that just a little bit, John, we have the security deposits that we need to apply against this amount. It\u2019s not appropriate to apply it against the delinquency. Now you usually by law do it when a resident moves out or near that time or with the residents agreements. So we do have a little bit of an offset there that we need to figure out, but there certainly be more delinquency. Bob, I think maybe you give a little color on what was delinquency in the great financial crisis. Bob Garechana : Yes. Delinquency and I\u2019m sorry and bad debt expense. So I\u2019ll talk maybe the bad debt expense to give you a frame of reference. So I mentioned earlier that in normal kind of environment, so not in the great financial crisis, we run about 50 basis points of total. In 2009, which would have been the worst year of the great financial crisis that 50 basis points converted itself to slightly over 100 basis points. Michael Manelis : Is that helpful, John, giving you a little bit of a frame of reference? John Pawlowski : Yes, definitely. I know it\u2019s a guessing game right now, but there\u2019s more cities enact a longer payback periods, Seattle, yesterday coming out and saying you have till 2021 imagine more cities along the coast will do the same. Just trying to understand how those historical relationships change in this in this environment. Thank you. Michael Manelis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll next go with Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Wes Golladay : Good morning guys. I\u2019m looking at that 11 million delinquency, is that mostly tied to hardship in your opinion or is it more people electing not to pay rent in more tenant friendly government, which is a coast on the last question. Mark Parrell : Wow. So just to make sure I understand your question Wes, is it mostly people have hardship issues that they can sort of document or is it folks that have just decided not to pay sort of the moral hazard issue? Is that the question? Wes Golladay : There on. Mark Parrell : Yes, I guess that\u2019s a little hard to tell for us. Some of the residents haven\u2019t called us back and we don\u2019t have insight into their thought process not paying us. But that\u2019s a very small number for us given again the quality of the portfolio. We\u2019re talking about a pretty small number of accounts here. So I guess I\u2019d say that most of the conversations that Michael has shared with me have been people saying, Hey, I need another week or two and then they pay it. So that\u2019s been most of the conversations that we\u2019ve had to-date. I\u2019d also point out that, there are people that may benefit from the checks that they\u2019ll receive from the government either through unemployment or through that federal supplementary payment. And I\u2019m not sure how quickly all those are reaching people either. And that could be a benefit to us as well. So I don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t have a breakdown or anything. We\u2019ve got a few people that have ghosted us, but that\u2019s a pretty small number. And really it\u2019s, most people have been talking to us. I mean, working something out. Again, it\u2019s not more payment plans, it\u2019s often just give me another couple of weeks and I\u2019ll pay you the rent. That\u2019s been a more predominant conversation. Wes Golladay : Okay. I appreciate you holding rent renewals flat in every portfolio. But you did call out some of your markets are actually doing quite strong, Seattle tech workers in particular. Well, I guess would you phase-in renewals for different segments or is it going to be a blanket kind of special renewals for the whole portfolio? And how you approach that, I guess the increases going forward? Michael Manelis : Yes, so I think this is Michael again. So I think we\u2019re now looking at kind of months like August and September renewal offers. And I think, each market always was done strategically with different kinds of parameters being set for kind of how we would issue kind of renewal offers. So I would expect, that there will be markets that will maintain kind of a no increase option for and then there\u2019ll be markets that we start going back to kind of tiring approaches and see kind of what those results are. Mark Parrell : And add to it isn\u2019t just markets, we priced by unit. So I mean in 2015 when things were great in the industry and great for our company and we had unit types there increases that we could get on renewals. And when you had bad years, like 2009 we had unit types that we did get increased on renewal. So it is a unit-by-unit thing. It is a market thing as it relates to maybe legal restrictions. But Michael and his team starting going forward are going to be looking at this saying, restrictions are removed. How do we now feel about supply and demand in the market and how are we going to think about this and that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re expecting to play it. Wes Golladay : Okay. One last one. I guess, looking at your platform, probably a little different than many of your competitors in the market. So do you think you\u2019re taking share of new applicants with the special applications and the self showing? Michael Manelis : Well I think our closing ratios tell us kind of whether or not we\u2019re kind of taking more market share. I mean historically we would run against what we used to call foot traffic, but that\u2019s got a whole new definition now with virtual leasing. But people that express interest do historically would close somewhere in that 20% range for people that express interest take tours with you. And right now that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019ve been balancing off. So when we\u2019re closing 30%, 35% we\u2019re getting more than kind of the normal share of those applicants. Wes Golladay : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll next move with Jeff Spector from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jeff Spector : Great, thank you. Good morning. Just a couple of follow-ups and then just maybe one big picture question. First on the \u2013 on occupancy in 2Q. I believe you mentioned you do expect 2Q to be the worst. I guess it\u2019s \u2013 just thinking about the applicants and \u2013 figuring out the right rent levels here. Is it just \u2013 it\u2019s going to be hard to convert those applicants into occupancy during 2Q, is that your expectations? Michael Manelis : No, I think I would say the impact from what we experienced at the tail end of March and April is really what brought kind of this occupancy down. Right now, even when you look at, call it the 900 applications that we had last week, call it 60% plus of them are moving in before May 22. So that\u2019s going to help kind of balance. So in the world of yield management, I mean you\u2019re optimizing revenue, you\u2019re trading off occupancy and rate and you\u2019re balancing this and that demand part of the equation is going to say whether or not you\u2019re going to optimize revenue at 95%, 95.5% or if you\u2019re going to kind of continue on this path, maybe you bounce back and start optimizing back at 96%. But I still think it\u2019s too early to understand where that sweet spot is for these portfolios. Jeff Spector : Okay, thanks. And then I was surprised to hear that garden style delinquencies were higher than mid-to-high rise. I believe you made that comment. Can you provide a little bit more color there? Michael Manelis : Yes, sure. So it was \u2013 it was almost in every single market that we looked at. We can see that relationship and some of this just has to do with where our kind of rent to income ratios. So it wasn\u2019t surprising, right. When you think about Seattle being the lowest, while Seattle also has our lowest rent as a percent of income. And when you go to LA it was the highest percent of income. And those are markets like, when you start looking at that, where we absolutely had more garden style property versus the high-rise property. But that relationship held true across all of our markets. Jeff Spector : Okay, thanks. And then in terms of the amenities, I thought it\u2019s encouraging to hear that you are working on, we used to open up the gyms or more open space and just thinking about working from home, is it too early to incorporate changes into buildings to maybe foster we\u2019re working from home environment within the apartment building. Like, can you set up areas that comply with social distancing to offer folks to work with, let say from a lounge within the building or is that just, is it too soon to tell? Michael Manelis : So I guess I will just start by saying first we have a whole group of individuals that are focused on what does it look like to be operating in the new normal. So that starts with looking at all of our existing common area space and understanding how are we going to guarantee the safety and wellbeing of our employees as well as our residents, once these spaces start to open up and operate. And I think that there\u2019s occupancy limits, there\u2019s spacing and fitness center, there\u2019s a lot of complexity to this and each one of our jurisdictions is going to have different kind of rules that we\u2019ll be applying to our operations as we think about opening up. But longer-term as we think about the fact that residents may be working from home more, it does create an opportunity for us to look at our common areas spaces and look at any of our available spaces that we may have in our properties and think about how do we make some adjustments to that to allow them the opportunity to work from home as well as adhere to social distancing. So I think you\u2019ll see us start to get creative with how we\u2019re using spaces going forward to allow for more of that to occur. Jeff Spector : Thanks. And then my last question, just a big picture from Mark, I believe Mark you mentioned there might be opportunities, is it too soon to share with us, your thoughts on just kind of your EQR strategy going-forward? I mean in the New York, New Jersey area and I admit, I am a bit more worried about New York, I heard some optimism there that, tech will still come to New York and hopefully they still do. But, can you share with us some big picture thoughts on your go-forward strategy when you think about opportunities? Mark Parrell : Great. So there\u2019s kind of two questions in that. Part of it I read is just when might we get active on the investment side and another is sort of a New York question, when that city might function a little better. And I guess I would start on the investment side by saying, as I said in my earlier remarks, there\u2019s just not a lot going on right now. We\u2019re seven weeks in, sellers still remember the price they would have gotten in early March and buyers think about the price they dream of getting right now and it\u2019s going to take a little while for that all to sort itself out. Some of the big deals that you might remember, we did we were quite active coming out of the great financial crisis. So purchasing the big portfolio in New York, and development land, and broken condos both on the East coast and the West coast those were all done 12 months to 18 months after the beginning of the great financial crisis. Those were fourth quarter, 2009 deals at the beginning and then into 2010. When you think about that crisis, the GFC really being at 2000 \u2013 mid-2008, third quarter of 2008 events. So I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s going to be a little while before we really see much to act on. So, I start with that. And the way we are sort of thinking about opportunity is trying to think about replacement costs a little bit, trying to think a little bit about what long-term growth will be in this market, did anything change that matters? And we think and this sort of gets into your New York question a little bit. We think these big cities and I\u2019ll focus a little on New York, are really quite resilient. I mean New York been through, as you\u2019re quite aware, riots, it\u2019s been through wars, it\u2019s been through epidemics before, it\u2019s been through 9/11 and after 9/11 there\u2019s a lot of comment that New York wouldn\u2019t come back and people would decamp from New York in size. And yet, New York had a terrific urbanization trend over the last 20 years and the population in New York city was higher in 2016 than it was in 2001. So I think every morning, millions of owners of businesses throughout the country are waking up trying to figure out how to run their restaurant, their cultural amenities, their nonprofit, their restaurant, whatever. And they\u2019re going to figure that out over time and we\u2019re going to have new rules about distancing and cleanliness, then over time, hopefully there\u2019s some cure to this and we don\u2019t have this top of mind, but I think these cities are going to adjust like they always have. And I think you could expect that we\u2019ll still be focused in our investment efforts on these large cities and these dense suburban areas for our apartment investment. Jeff Spector : Thank you for your thoughts. I wish everyone well. Mark Parrell : Yes, same. You stay well. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll next go with Hardik Goel from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead. Hardik Goel : Thanks for the color. I haven\u2019t promised \u2013 market, are you seeing a difference in investor sentiment and the gateway city is versus somewhere like Denver. And what is your thought on, where cap rates might eventually the federal out when buyers and sellers meet in the middle? Mark Parrell : Great. So I\u2019m going to repeat that back to make sure I understood it. You had a question about where cap rates might end up through this and then investor interest in some of these less dense markets like Denver. The first, the Denver question or the investor interest question. As we look at that, it\u2019s just again, a little early for us to sort that out. I think some types of trades like for example, the value-add trade may be less attractive. I think you\u2019re going to have a hard time doing your renovations, you\u2019re going to have hard time jacking up \u2018rents, all of those things. And a lot of the value-add deals that were done just before the pandemic are likely to perform pretty poorly. So my sense is that you\u2019re going to see investor interest get sorted out. And I think, and we\u2019ve talked about this in the last call. Cap rates had really compressed between all these markets and I think as you go through this recession and you get past some of this government stimulus, you\u2019re going to see people with better resident basis like ours perform better. And you\u2019re going to see those cap rates on those properties be more durable than cap rates than it\u2019s sort of come down on B and C quality stuff and in lesser markets and have lesser employment basis than the ones we\u2019re in. So that is our sense of things in terms of where cap rates end up. Part of this is of course a function of interest rates and rates are incredibly low, but there\u2019s also a limiter because of replacement costs. So I think there\u2019s a bunch of things going on with cap rates. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if cap rates in two or three years weren\u2019t lower, than they were before the pandemic because of the interaction of interest rates. My sense that the apartment sector and our company in particular will perform better than most other real estate and that there\u2019ll be more capital attracted to the area. And then you just got to think about replacement costs, because you\u2019d be careful about paying big premiums to replacement costs no matter what interest rates are when you buy an asset. So I guess I look through it and say, wouldn\u2019t surprise me if cap rates were lower in a few years than what they are now for those reasons. Hardik Goel : And just as a quick follow-up, could you split out what delinquency is? For just garden style properties versus let\u2019s say you\u2019re high-rise. Mark Parrell : Yes, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to give quite that level of detail. I think that\u2019s just probably more than we have at our fingertips. Hardik Goel : Got it. Thanks. That\u2019s all from me. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll next go with Rich Hill from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Rich Hill : Hey almost good afternoon guys. At least on the East Coast, just two quick final \u2013 follow-up questions. When we think about the 97% of rents that you collected versus March, I\u2019m sorry if you mentioned this already, but does that 97% include the declining occupancies that you noted or should we think about the declining occupancies on top of the 97% of rents you collected? Bob Garechana : Let me make sure I understand the question kind of frame of reference and I\u2019m going to rephrase it and hopefully this answers your question. It\u2019s Bob here, Rich. So the 97% is measured half of March, rental payments. In March we had higher occupancy, right. So then we did in April, so if anything, it probably understate that 97% probably understates what the collection percentage is as a whole. Does that answer your question? Rich Hill : Yes, I think that\u2019s exactly what I was trying to get at. So said another way, if your occupancy went down 1.5 percentage point and that would be included in the percent of rent that you did not collect compared to the month prior. Bob Garechana : That is correct. Rich Hill : Okay, thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. And then one bigger picture question. I\u2019ve heard a lot of conversations about the GFC, but I\u2019m curious, why isn\u2019t post 9/11 a better proxy for what this recession might look like? Obviously a big shock to the system, payrolls went down, there were some job losses, but maybe job loss is focused on lower income earners. How do you guys think about that? And I recognize not everyone\u2019s been in the industry since 9/11, but you guys have a long institutional memory. So how do you think about this versus 9/11? Michael Manelis : Well, most of us in this room were, so we remember that unfortunate event distinctly. First off, I\u2019d say our portfolio compared to the 2008 great financial crisis is very similar. When you go all the way back to 2001 it\u2019s a very different portfolio. So when you think about what lessons we would pull out of that, when that happened, of course it also created this \u2013 which led to the next problem, created a big boom in purchasing single family homes. And so our markets like Phoenix, where we owned at that point, really suffered. I don\u2019t know how to think about that. Again, rates are really low, but mortgage capital is not that loose. So I appreciate that there are similarities both to the GFC and to the 9/11, because 9/11 was much more of that existential shock like COVID is, but our portfolio was so different, it\u2019s hard for me to draw some lessons to share with you. Rich Hill : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. All right that\u2019s it for me guys. I appreciate the transparency in this quarter. Michael Manelis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll next go with John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. John Kim : Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could quantify, what do you think the impact is on rent deferrals and reduced fees to the same store revenue? Michael Manelis : Yes. So the answer for all question, I guess the long-term impact will depend on kind of what bad debt turns out to be John, right. So we\u2019re not providing guidance, but that will factor in deferral, you would recognize your revenue in a normal course. The question is what bad debt ends up being on that piece. Certainly we will be impacted by fee revenue or lack of fee revenue potentially with lower applications and some of tax in our markets, but it\u2019s hard to \u2013 it\u2019s not a meaningful part of the overall top line, so it\u2019s not a huge impact. Mark Parrell : And I would say even the fact that we\u2019ve been waiving late fees, that\u2019s a short-term kind of impact and even those dollars are not that significant. Michael Manelis : Yes. John Kim : But if the tenant is on a payment plan or deferred rent, it would not impact the FFO and also not impact same store revenue. Is that correct? Mark Parrell : So if a resident is on \u2013 a tenant on the nonresidential side is on a deferral program, you\u2019re still going to recognize the revenue unless you believe the revenue is not collectible, at which point you\u2019re going to reserve against the revenue or take a bad debt expense against that revenue line items. So all sheer nature of having deferral doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you\u2019re not going to recognize the revenue. It\u2019s all about collectability. Michael Manelis : Debt delinquency is just to tell you where we\u2019ve charged revenue but haven\u2019t received cash. So over time, to be very specific and this will be a discussion with our auditors and the audit committee, and we\u2019ll think about this, because again we\u2019re fortunate not to be either familiar with delinquency, alright. So we\u2019ll get into June and July and we\u2019ll look at these folks and we\u2019ll see if they\u2019re performing per the payment plans, if they\u2019re still in the units and we\u2019ll write things off and that will run through revenue. That\u2019s where bad debt runs through revenue. And then there\u2019ll be a number of people that will effectively have this receivable outstanding and we\u2019ll be getting paid on it. And we\u2019ll be hopefully just as transparent as we are right now with you about all those numbers, whether it be write-off, whether it remains in the account receivable and what\u2019s the status of the payments we\u2019ve received on delinquent accounts. John Kim : Yes, that makes sense. And then the secondly, I was wondering if you offer to your tenants payment of rent with credit cards and if you\u2019ve seen any trends that in the last couple of months. Michael Manelis : Yes, so we did, well. First of all, we\u2019ve always had the option to pay rent with a credit card, it\u2019s just that there were fees associated with that processing fees. So through the process of our conversations, we are allowing residents to pay their delinquent balance with a credit card and we would absorb the processing fee. It just is not a material number at all, right now. The fees are well below even a $100,000 kind of level. Mark Parrell : Yes, that\u2019s really encouraging because that shows you that our residents aren\u2019t living hand to mouth and having to put a month credit card on their credit card or rental payment. So we think that\u2019s encouraging from our point of view. John Kim : Okay. Thank you very much. Mark Parrell : Thank you John. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll next go with Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning. Good morning out there. So two questions : First, can you just go back through the delinquency? So the 5.5% delinquents, number of municipalities, New York, California, et cetera? Have the eviction moratoriums so it would seem like tenants really don\u2019t have any incentive to go on a payment plan for a good period of time as these things are pushed out? But Mark, you said that a lot of people are coming to you voluntarily and not many have been ghosting. So how do we reconcile the two that a lot of your tenants seem to be coming to you and yet the delinquencies are still high? Are people playing the eviction thing, and they just realized that they can skip a few months rent and pay it next year or maybe never pay it? Or how should we think about this? Mark Parrell : Hey, Alex, it\u2019s Mark. I guess I\u2019m going to take issue with the idea that our delinquency is high. I mean, I \u2013 again you\u2019re talking about a company with $220-plus million, a monthly residential revenue that in \u2013 what is the worst panic of our lifetimes? Maybe as $5 million of rent we\u2019re chasing around and making progress on. So I don\u2019t feel like this is a big number of people. I\u2019m more concerned, frankly, about the recession than I am about delinquency in our portfolio. Listen, we\u2019ve got high-level credit tenants. These obligations aren\u2019t going away. We\u2019re not going anywhere. So these are folks that value their credit that know they\u2019re receiving a great service. I mean I\u2019m lucky I get to read all the feedback that our residents right on our teams on site. And that feedback, Alex, has been really good. They really appreciate that our people, our frontline workers at EQR are keeping the property clean, are maintaining all the essential parts of the building so they can shelter-in-place. They don\u2019t look at this rent as something they need to avoid, they don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not ripping them off, we\u2019re taking care of them in a crisis. So I guess, I\u2019d say I think our resident mindset, at least as far as I can tell is very different than the sort of resident mindset you\u2019re describing. Are there a few people that are taking advantage of the system and creating this moral hazard? Absolutely. And that\u2019s just playing on. I mean we\u2019re turning around and paying their rent in property taxes to these hard press municipalities, to our hard-working frontline workers. I mean that\u2019s just wrong, but I\u2019ll tell you, we\u2019re not going to stop being persistent pursuing them. We\u2019ll follow the law, but they owe the rent. And sooner or later, there will be a discussion about that. So I guess I\u2019d put it to you that way. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. No, listen, that\u2019s \u2013 Mark, that\u2019s helpful. Yes. And then second question is, just in New York, specifically, obviously, a lot of us are impacted, whether we live in the city or outside of commute. But from what you are hearing from your property from the managers there, are you hearing about what are they saying their residents are looking to do? Are a number looking to leave, are a number looking to move in? Because you say you keep your buildings better maintained than probably a number of your New York neighbors. So what is the sort of mood and expectation for New York this summer through the summer leasing season? Mark Parrell : Well, I guess I would just start by saying New York, one, it\u2019s always had the strongest retention in the portfolio, but it absolutely is seeing an improved retention with renewals at that 70% level. We\u2019ve never experienced that in the city. So a lot of our residents are staying put. And it\u2019s not like they\u2019re just staying for a month or two months, they\u2019re renewing at those 12-month terms. As far as the front door, that\u2019s a really tough thing to answer right now because it\u2019s not rebounding yet like the other markets have, which understandably, it\u2019s the hardest hit from the COVID. So I think we need to see a little bit of the public health crisis kind of soften or dampen a little bit in New York to get a feel as to what the new folks coming in are saying and what they\u2019re looking for and everything else like that. But I think the retention side of it, short term, is a positive for us. Michael Manelis : The other thing, Alex, we\u2019ve been wondering about, and we don\u2019t know. As Mark said, the biggest question mark is just when do the stay at home orders get lifted? And when do people feel comfortable getting out there and looking for apartments and doing virtual tours. I mean there\u2019s going to be more distancing, but are they going to feel comfortable doing a self-guided tour in our property on their own, but they\u2019re able to see the site. Those are more efficient. Those are good marketing techniques. That will improve closing. So we\u2019re trying to balance all that. We\u2019ve also done some extensions of people into the fall. Those people probably want to go somewhere, and it\u2019s probably true that there\u2019s other people and other apartment owners\u2019 portfolios. So we wonder about whether the lease \u2013 this isn\u2019t a leasing season different than any other, where it might go \u2013 might be as high a peak, but kind of go a little bit longer into the shoulder season a bit. But that\u2019s a little speculation on our part we\u2019re trying to sort out, because again, we and no one else has been through this before. Alexander Goldfarb : And hopefully, we don\u2019t go through it for another 100 years. Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thanks. Stay well. Operator : Thank you. We will go next with Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Rick Skidmore : Good morning, thank you. Just one quick question. As you think about occupancy and the trade-off of kind of grow occupancy, how do you think about tenant credit quality or the various tenants that you\u2019re looking at? And are you able to perhaps high grade? Or do you move perhaps down the credit quality spectrum as you look to build occupancy? Thank you. Michael Manelis : So right now, I will tell you, we\u2019re not changing our models, our criteria for underwriting residents. I mean we have a strong resident base, and I think that\u2019s proven some of the benefits out right now. And I think we\u2019re going to continue down that path. Obviously, if the demand profiles totally change through the summer and all that, we can revisit that and pull some levers and make some changes. But at this point, we don\u2019t expect to do that. Rick Skidmore : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll next go with John Guinee with Stifel. Please go ahead. John Guinee : John Guinee here. Question, first, hey Mark, nice \u2013 really nice job today. Give me a little more detail, what does ghosted us exactly mean? Mark Parrell : Thanks for that comment, and I\u2019m going to hand it over to Michael because we\u2019ve used that term, he and I between us, and maybe that needs more definition. Michael Manelis : Yes. I think just to give some color to that. Obviously, our on-type, they\u2019re working really hard. And I think I said this before, this is difficult, right, because it\u2019s heavy lifting to go after some of these delinquent balances because you have to have the ear, you have to have the tone of empathy, but you also have to reinforce the obligations that sit with this stuff. So we have outreach programs, right, for folks that we haven\u2019t heard from. We\u2019re trying to do well-being checks on many of our residents that we haven\u2019t heard from as well. And the term ghosting is we\u2019ve left some messages, we\u2019ve sent some e-mails, and we\u2019ve gotten zero response back from those folks. And again, I think Mark alluded to it. It\u2019s a small subset of this group that we\u2019re dealing with. But eventually, we have to have some conversations with these folks. John Guinee : Okay. So it doesn\u2019t mean they moved out in the dark of night and took half their furniture with them or maybe not? It just means they\u2019re going silent on you? Michael Manelis : Goon silent. I mean some of the markets; we\u2019re putting some notices on the door to make sure because we will enter to make sure that it hasn\u2019t been vacated on us, and that is part of a process, but that is one of the things that we would be doing. John Guinee : Okay. And then second, you obviously have a computer-generated revenue optimization tools and to run like everybody else run to full occupancy. Is there a color, both in good and bad in terms of how far you would drop rents in the next six to 12 months to maintain full occupancy? Or are you not there yet? Mark Parrell : No. We\u2019re definitely not there yet. I guess I can give you a little bit of context. So first and foremost, in the beginning of March, we changed some of our parameters inside these yield management applications to just lessen the volatility of pricing to begin with. On March 20th, we actually stopped generating prices from the pricing engine. We turned it off in essence and just let all of our prices stay as they were regardless of lease term, regardless duration of lease as well. So at that point, now we\u2019re watching and we\u2019re seeing the kind of the application \u2013 or the traffic come back and the application volume come back. So just a couple of weeks ago, we started to reinitialize kind of that LRO or the yield management application to start sending out the daily price changes as well. So I don\u2019t know exactly, I think I said this before, where we\u2019ll optimize kind of revenue, what level of occupancy it is and what rate decline you\u2019d allow. I think demand is going to tell you where \u2013 what that market clearing price needs to be. But I think you can see right now, I alluded to the fact that the base rents are down 4%, and we\u2019re closing at a higher percentage of what we normally would be. So that, to me, feels like the right level today, and we\u2019ll just see where the demand levels are going forward. John Guinee : Okay. Great. And then last question, I think you\u2019ve got increased disclosure. Thank you. Any consideration of bringing back your disclosure for your consolidated joint ventures? Mark Parrell : I mean, so our unconsolidated joint ventures at the moment are really just one asset that\u2019s it\u2019s a garage parking kind of\u2026 Bon Garechana : Did you say consolidated or unconsolidated? John Guinee : You\u2019re consolidated. You use to carve out your partners\u2019 ownership or economics of the consolidated JVs? I think you stopped doing that? Mark Parrell : Got it. Yes. It\u2019s a very de-minimis amount. Happy to give you more color, and Marty or I could give you more color about it. But it\u2019s a very small percentage. And it\u2019s also; I think there\u2019s more disclosure in the 10-Q \u2013 in the footnotes in the 10-Q. We just stopped including a whole page in the supplemental of the press release. But in the 10-Q, we can point you to some color on that. John Guinee : Great. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll next go with Haendel Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Haendel Juste : Hello out there. Mark Parrell : Hey Haendel. Haendel Juste : So, I think your comments earlier on potential changes you\u2019re considering to the annual leasing cycle in a post-COVID world interesting that more leasing could be shifted forward out of the second quarter and third quarter periods where I think historically you\u2019ve done 60% plus of your leasing. So just curious on how active some of these considerations are and how that might look? Any color that would be appreciated. Thanks. Mark Parrell : Yes. So I\u2019m going to start, it\u2019s Mark, and Michael is going to supplement here. This is more of us looking at small sample sizes and seeing a little shifting and trying to figure out the conduct of our customer in this kind of hairy situation. So I can\u2019t tell you, we\u2019re sure that demand will be flattened out. It will just be longer. That\u2019s just; again, we have a few of those. Michael, by turning on the pricing machine, has already begun doing something. We don\u2019t want to do six month leases now and have expirations in the late fourth quarter. So to incentivize us to do that, we are going to raise your rent. If you want a renewal for a one-year term on like-term, we\u2019ll do that flat. So I guess, Haendel, we\u2019re going to still manage our expiration schedule, but there are a few people who took shorter term and our portfolio and we\u2019re guessing others, shorter term extensions in March and April because listen, no one was in a position to really move and so you may see some of those people turn around and go, okay, now I\u2019m ready. It\u2019s August and they would have been ready instead in April or May, right. So there may be a little bit of a shift, but it\u2019s not fully discernible, I\u2019d say at this point. Haendel Juste : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And just to be clear, the folks who are taking short-term lease extensions here, are they subject to the same premiums that they would have been historically or before COVID or are those also been extended at zero percent? Michael Manelis : No. So, everybody basically since March 15 has had flexibility to move to any term at no increase at no increase. We basically froze rents regardless of term and now, we\u2019re starting to pivot and change off of that. And that was our way to kind of help people through these unprecedented times, people that were really nervous about moving. We wanted to give them the opportunity to just stay. So I think the peak leasing season, like we all knew it, is definitely impacted from this. We just don\u2019t understand yet how that impact is going to play out. Haendel Juste : Got it. Got it. Thank you for that. Another \"lives in a post-COVID world\" question. I\u2019m curious if your recent experience with virtual and contactless leasing makes you more inclined to accelerate and increase tech investments here near term as you tweak operating platform for a post-COVID world? And what do you think some of the more lasting changes in your leasing and operations approach could be? I\u2019m assuming in that kind of world, you\u2019ll have more virtual leasing, maybe less need for on-site personnel. So just curious on how the business might be changed here, your views on technology investments? And then maybe some thoughts on retail exposure. Is that something that perhaps going forward you would look to have less loss? Michael Manelis : So, this is Michael. Maybe I\u2019ll start with just kind of the impact on the operations. I will tell you, I think you\u2019ve heard us talk a lot about what we were doing from a sales process and all the initiatives that we were teeing up before all this. I think this was an accelerator to us. I think this just advanced a lot of the things that we were already kind of teeing up and thinking about. I think it added a new layer with this virtual leasing and having kind of high-content video available, doing FaceTime kind of live tours. That\u2019s a new element to the sales process. And I think going forward, we\u2019re going to continue to have all of the above available as our sales process. It\u2019s just another tool kind of that we\u2019ll have available to close leases and applications. As far as the tech investment side goes, this did not change the tech investment that we were thinking about from the service side of the business. We already deployed that mobile kind of software. And I\u2019ll be honest with you, that was a huge advantage for us in this. It allowed our team to quickly pivot to focus on urgent service requests only. We had complete transparency at the top of the house as to what was happening all the way down to an individual tech. So we knew what needed to get done all from your mobile device. That was a big win. On the sales side of the business, we\u2019ve already made most of the investments in the technology that we\u2019re going to need to run. I think the biggest thing that was out there is you heard us talk about making some investment into the smart home technology, where we were getting ready to move forward with about 10,000 units this year. We already have about 2,500 units deployed. I think that\u2019s one of the areas that we\u2019ll probably pause, and we\u2019re going to see the next-gen of technology come out that probably won\u2019t have keypads that will be Bluetooth-enabled. There\u2019s already some of this technology available. But we\u2019ll just wait to see it kind of get vet out a little bit, and then we\u2019ll continue to move forward with that. But I think as you think about operations going forward, it is very clear that contactless, touch-free, those are kind of things that are going to be with us in this environment, not only immediately but probably even longer term in this world of new normal. And Bob, maybe you want to just hit on the retail? Bob Garechana : Yes. No. The retail and non-residential pieces, we\u2019ve always focused on minimizing that exposure. We\u2019ve focused on investing in high-quality apartment buildings, right? We\u2019re an apartment company, so that hasn\u2019t changed. That\u2019s how we ended up with the limited exposure that we have here today. So I don\u2019t think from a strategy standpoint, that\u2019s going to change at all. In our markets, particularly in the urban areas, there is typically, with these high-quality assets, some exposure to retail. Haendel Juste : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And one more clarification. I think earlier, you guys mentioned that 60% of the new leases you signed recently are set to move in before May 12? I wonder if I heard that correctly. And then I guess I\u2019m more curious how the time between lease approval and movement is being impacted here by COVID? Any noticeable change or delay in that timing on either your part or the customer\u2019s part? And maybe help us put that 60% figure into some context? Thanks. Michael Manelis : Yes. So first, it\u2019s 60% of the applications last week are scheduled to move in before May 22, not May 12. And I think from a behavior standpoint, as you think about the duration, I think this is the time of the year, right, where you have a lot of people looking to lease future months. Their leases are expiring. That\u2019s typically what you see in a peak leasing season. And I think we\u2019re seeing that. We\u2019re seeing demand for June still, and we\u2019re seeing some of our notice to vacate or units that we will have become vacant in the future, those are being sold today; but not a huge change in their normal behavior. Haendel Juste : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We will next go with Nick Joseph from Citi. Michael Bilerman : Hey, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman. Mark, I wanted \u2013 and look, I appreciate your comments about the resiliency of New York and other dense urban cities. But I also know that this is a pretty unprecedented time that doesn\u2019t have sort of a marker relative to other times. And I wanted to know what the house view, and I don\u2019t know if this means a TAM\u2019s view, but collectively, as an equity organization about the interplay between office utilization and where you live, whether that\u2019s a rental apartment or a house or a condo or whatever it is. But the whole dynamic, once we get post this, and just from a frame of reference, yes, 9/1 had a massive impact, clearly in New York and organizations\u2019 desires to be in big office towers. This \u2013 what we\u2019re going through now is 100% of Corporate America, except for essential workers, have their organizations working remotely. I would imagine that, that is going to change some element of how corporations will see where their workforces are, who they are and where they may live. And I would have thought that could have significant impacts in terms of how things would play out from a residential perspective. So can you dive a little bit more into that element? Mark Parrell : Sure. A lot there to unpack. And I certainly think very thoughtful. And I mean, it is an evolving situation. No doubt, this is a 100-year event, we hope, and we\u2019re going to go all go through it together and figure it out. I was trying to get to this thought process about vibrancy and flexibility that these big urban areas have gone through a lot before, and they\u2019ll figure this out too in ways that we can\u2019t yet determine. And you talked just a little bit. And I wonder about that, Michael, about corporate preferences versus individuals. And people could probably always live in different places and telecommute, and now they\u2019ll be able to telecommute even more. I agree with that part of it. But our sorts of people, these affluent renters, they like living in these urban and dense suburban places. And right now, they\u2019re thrown off a little because we\u2019re all trying to figure out how do you run New York City with more social distancing and cleanliness. Is it shift? So how does that all work? But every day, millions of people are waking up trying to figure out how to do that, how to run the transit systems and the restaurants and all of that. So I guess I\u2019d say, I\u2019m certainly not of the mind that that\u2019s something you abandon very quickly, that all of a sudden, we\u2019re all moving to ex-urban and rural settings. That doesn\u2019t make sense to me that the preference for young affluent renters like we have to live in these cities among their peers is pretty durable and pretty strong. So I guess I don\u2019t deny this is unprecedented, but I guess I\u2019d answer by saying the companies may allow more teleworking and almost certainly will, us include. But I think residents \u2013 or excuse me, employees will still choose where they care to reside. And I think our markets will still be very attractive to them and that the denser solutions, especially as we work through new ways to be clean inside buildings and the distance inside buildings, that will kind of work itself out over time. So I guess that\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the house view, but that\u2019s the sort of EQR view. And I think Sam has been on record very recently in a big broadcast about the strength of the residential business. So I think we feel good about our business model. Michael Bilerman : Right. I just \u2013 I wonder if there is an investment or a future opportunity if corporations are going to have some portion of their workforce, right? The incremental hire they\u2019re going to have, I would believe Corporate America, just as you would look at an employee and say, we can find a really good operations person that may not have to be in Chicago and be in the head office, but given all of our technological improvements, and we\u2019ve all now had this trial it works. You may find that incremental higher, you may want to put in Denver or another local market where you don\u2019t have an office, and that person, if they\u2019re living in an EQR community may lead a certain amount of office. And so is there an opportunity to further the investment in your communities to provide a \u2013 and you\u2019d already started some of this in terms of the need of co-working and things like that. I don\u2019t know if there is a trend there that you started to think about? Mark Parrell : Yes. I mean Michael had some comments on that. I mean we are trying to figure out how we can make our apartment buildings even more comfortable as these common areas open up in this new distancing and cleanliness environment. I think that\u2019s something that we\u2019re working on right now. And you\u2019re right to ask about, and I think we want to make our properties attractive for people to spend more hours per day than they probably have in the past, at least for a while. And the good news is you\u2019ve been in a lot of our buildings. They have terrific amenities. They have terrific \u2013 most of them have just terrific lounges and large roof decks in places where you can be home but be outside your unit for a period of time and still feel safe. So I think that\u2019s something we\u2019ll market. And again, we\u2019ve got to get the cleanliness and the safety thing right as an industry, and we will. And then I think you\u2019ll have the advantage of being at-home but outside your unit and will feel good to our residents. Michael Bilerman : Right. And just last thing in these higher density, higher rent locations, there\u2019s a certain aspect of these cities that have a massive cultural aspect. And while I would think about L.A. and San Francisco, New York, Seattle, all trying to reopen parts of that. You\u2019re not going to reopen it at full force. And the other part of it is the taxes in those locations are very high, and the employment places are not going to bring back 100% of their employees because they can\u2019t in a social distance world. And I just wonder whether more younger, affluent people are going to say, I\u2019m just going to go lease in Denver or Austin or Miami for a year because I don\u2019t \u2013 my office doesn\u2019t need a 100% going back and none of the things that I live in the city for can I enjoy. And so could the occupancies get further in the near term before we sort of come out on the other side? Mark Parrell : Great question. I can\u2019t give you certainty on any of this. I\u2019ll just say that, so far, we\u2019ve seen demand even in lockdown start to head up again already. I mean it seems to us that our demographic, and this is anecdotal, I have a daughter who\u2019s college age. I know a lot of kids in their mid-20s, and they don\u2019t want to live with their parents anymore. They want to go back to the big cities and be in their apartments and live their lives again. So I guess I\u2019d be more anxious about owning a bunch of apartment buildings in Orlando or Miami, where they\u2019re hospitality-dependent, that\u2019s closed down and you wonder, how many people who work at airports and hotels and theme parks and cruise lines will ever come back to work. I think that\u2019s a pretty salient question to ask. I think you\u2019re right, there\u2019s \u2013 these telecommuting options will be more available to people. But I think people didn\u2019t live in Brooklyn because it was cheap, people live in Brooklyn because they love the cultural amenities, they love the restaurants and all that stuff\u2019s closed down. And now everyone\u2019s figuring out how to reopen it, and I think it will reopen and over a period of time, as you suggested, and make those submarkets that we operate in continue to be pretty attractive. Michael Bilerman : Okay. All right. Appreciate taking time to answer the questions and for all the details you gave and they are really superb. Mark Parrell : Stay healthy. Appreciate the big questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will next go with Hardik Goel from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead. Hardik Goel : I just wanted to be respectful of everyone\u2019s time, so I joined back in. Mark, I guess, is \u2013 it\u2019s not so much a question, but I just need your help understanding something. Garden has higher delinquency across your portfolio. The employment basis in some of the markets you are not in is weaker and yet, EQR is trading at a discount to some of its other peers, the greater discount than it\u2019s ever traded at. And there\u2019s this narrative about the future of apartments and suburban living and all that. But right now, we have 30% unemployment. And your portfolio has performed really well through that. And unemployment has got to be in some markets, so I\u2019m a little confused by the investor response, and \u2013 I just don\u2019t get it? Mark Parrell : Well, I just would ask you to spread the word. I \u2013 listen, I think what we were trying to get across in the release, besides this general feeling of empathy and concern for our communities, which are going through hell and back right now is that we did pretty well in April. We did pretty well as a company in the midst of this pandemic. And when you look long term, a lot of what just happened with COVID, doesn\u2019t \u2013 you don\u2019t look at our strategy and go, that doesn\u2019t make sense, like you do some other real estate sectors. Our strategy makes a lot of sense. But in between then and now is this recession, and we\u2019re all going to go through that, and we\u2019re going to see how it goes. Our company has been pretty resilient through those. We\u2019ve come out of it historically faster and better. So I think we just need to make our case and continue to be effective and transparent. And we\u2019re confident investors over time, and smart analysts like you will pick it up and people will see the opportunity. So I guess we think about running the business long term, and investors will respond to it over the long run. Hardik Goel : Thanks. And you know, really appreciate the disclosures you guys put out. I think the reporting and the messaging was really transparent and high quality. Thanks a lot guys. Mark Parrell : Thank you. All credit to Bob and his team. So thank you for that. Operator : Thank you. This marks the end of the question-and-answer session. I will give the floor back to the moderator. Mark Parrell : Well, we thank you all for your time today, and we hope everyone stays healthy. Good day. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you all for your participation. You may go ahead and disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Marty McKenna. Please, go ahead. Marty McKenna : Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's second quarter 2020 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now, I'll turn it over to Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. During one of the most challenging periods in our country and industry's history, we feel that our business showed considerable resiliency. We continue to be pleased with the financial strength of our customer base, with our average annual household incomes of $164,000. Data suggests that only 4% of workers, making more than $150,000 a year, have recently lost their jobs compared to the low-teens for lower income categories. We have collected about 97% of our residential rents during the second quarter and attribute this to a customer base that remains well-employed and capable of meeting their obligations. July is trending similarly. We also demonstrated strong expense results, while the pandemic both added and subtracted costs from our operations, the innovations around leasing and service that we described in prior calls have really taken hold and we expect a durable reduction in our expense growth rate even after COVID is in the rear view mirror. And while our 90 basis point decline in same store residential revenue was our first quarterly revenue decline in 10 years, our residential business held up reasonably well under very trying circumstances. We also believe that we have stabilized our physical occupancy at 95%. In a moment, Michael will give you some color on what is going on in each of our markets and Bob will address our expenses, non-residential operations and balance sheet. And then, we will welcome your questions. But before I turn it over, I want to highlight a couple of things. First, in the quarter, we stabilized two development properties, one in Cambridge, Massachusetts and another in Seattle, Washington. The Cambridge asset is a 64-unit property, adjacent to an existing asset of ours and was built for $47 million and stabilize at approximately 5% yield on cost. This property complements our large existing Cambridge portfolio of six properties with about a 1,100 units and is ideally suited to house the biotech employees working in that area. The other property consists of 137 units and is located in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle and cost $65 million to build. It stabilized at about a 5% yield on cost. In terms of transactions, we're pleased to close on two dispositions during the quarter and have sold more than $750 million in assets during 2020. We feel that we received strong pricing on this quarter sales, as both sold assets were over 50 years old and our combined disposition yield was 4.4%. But we note that these sales were priced prior to the pandemic and so shouldn't be seen as a look through on current pricing. We have not acquired anything this year, but we like to think of ourselves as professional opportunists and have a balance sheet that as strong as it has ever been, which will allow us to take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves. And now a bit about our capital allocation strategy. We have spoken on prior calls about the company broadening its portfolio by expanding into Denver and into the dense suburbs of our markets. For the last few years, we've been actively pruning our exposure in some urban locations, including Manhattan, and buying more dense suburban assets. Our current portfolio mix stands at about 55% urban and 45% suburban. We will continue to build and buy apartments in locations, both urban and dense suburban, where affluent renters wish to live and in markets where we feel long-term returns will be maximized. We believe that our strategy is sufficiently flexible to retain high-quality urban properties, while adding some breath of the portfolio over time, so we can continue to produce a reliable and growing stream of income for our shareholders. And now, I will turn the call over to Michael Manelis. Michael Manelis : Thanks, Mark. Let me start by acknowledging the dedication and hard work of our employees during the second quarter. Despite very challenging operating conditions, the team was able to focus on the health and safety of their fellow employees and our residents by implementing our new operating standards to address COVID concerns. These heightened cleanliness standards have been well received by residents and prospects. The team elevated their voices in various listening sessions held throughout our organization to share how they were navigating and managing stress due to the unrest in our country. Their voices will help us continue to cultivate a culture of inclusion at Equity Residential. They stayed on top of delinquency by executing a consistent and transparent process that emphasize frequent communication with residents who are financially impacted by the virus. Our collection rate remained strong and fairly stable throughout the quarter, with a little over 97% being collected. They focused on retaining existing residents, as evidenced by turnover at 11.8% for the quarter, which is a 130 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2019. This was driven by a 10% reduction in move-outs during the quarter, as more residents opted to stay in place. Achieved renewal rate increases were positive 70 basis points for the quarter, but we expect this number to trend lower as negotiations become more challenging. Right now about 20% of our renewal offers for July and August include a slight market rate increase. The team also adopted new technologies for both sales and service that allowed us to meet the needs of our customers while creating operating efficiencies, which contributed to the low growth in our operating expenses. As to occupancy, we stated on the last call that we expected the occupancy impact to be the most pronounced in the second quarter, setting a new base from which we've hoped we would improve as shelter-in-place orders were lifted that so far appears to be the case. The portfolio was 95% occupied today and we average 94.9% through the quarter after recovering from a 94.2% low point in mid-May. On the rate side, since last week in May, base rents have been relatively stable, but this is bit of a bifurcated story. Pricing remains challenged in the urban cores of New York the city of Boston and Downtown San Francisco, which represents about one quarter of our portfolio. The rest of the portfolio is showing more price stability. The rents are still lower than last year. New lease change was down 7% this quarter for our same-store portfolio, before concessions. New lease concessions during the quarter, were heavily concentrated in the urban cores of New York, San Francisco and Boston. Factoring in concessions, the net effective new lease change for the portfolio during the quarter was down 9%. Overall traffic and application activity improved throughout the quarter as net effective prices were being lowered. As we mentioned on last quarter's call, application activity was recovering at the end of April and continued to do so through the remainder of the quarter. By late May and into June, we are seeing somewhat higher new applications week-over-week relative to the same periods in 2019. This improvement, however, was not sufficient to make up for the nearly 40% year-over-year reduction experienced in April. As a result, the total number of move-ins for the second quarter, were 20% below the second quarter of 2019. At present, we think it is helpful to split our portfolio into three pieces as we think about our forward operating performance. First, our suburban assets, which represents approximately 45% of the company's portfolio, have been more resilient during the pandemic with occupancy declining to a low point of 95.2% before recovering fully to levels at or above prior year and ending the quarter at t 96.6%. Suburban renewal percent was very strong at 65% and continues to trend well above prior year. Rates have been slowly recovering since early May, and there have been very limited concessions used in this portfolio. Second, our urban assets that are located in the city of Boston and Cambridge, Manhattan and Brooklyn and Downtown San Francisco, which represents about 25% of the company's portfolio and is currently 91% occupied. As stated earlier, this portfolio has the highest use of concessions and the most rate pressure. For the quarter, this urban portfolio renewed 58% of residents, which is 500 basis points lower than Q2 of 2019 and was trending down throughout the quarter ending at 53% in June. The urban cores in Boston, New York and San Francisco have the highest risk of volatility in operations for the balance of the year. Our third grouping, consist of urban assets and other markets like Washington D.C., Seattle and Southern California and consist of about 30% of our portfolio. These assets reached the low point in occupancy of 94% in mid-May, but quickly bounce back and remained at 95.2%. Pricing has been stable since the middle of May, with rates being down year-over-year and concessions being used on about 15% of our applications. During the quarter, 57% of residents renewed from these assets, which is 300 basis points better than the second quarter of 2019. Overall, this group of urban assets has had consistent operations for the past two months with a slight uptick in occupancy in the past couple of weeks. Let me provide some quick color on the markets. Starting with Boston, the urban center of Boston and Cambridge represent about three quarters of our total Boston portfolio and were more impacted by early termination in non-renewals from international students and third party corporate providers, while neither one of these represent a significant amount of total units, the impact was concentrated. The Boston urban center is now 91.5% occupied and continues to be pressured on rates and occupancy, especially given the uncertainty around international students and the competitive supply being delivered. The other submarkets in Boston have been operating at 95%, with consistent rates and very little concession use. Overall, applications have been running at or above prior year for the entire market as we see good demand for our product. We continue to like this market long-term due to its combination of bio, education and technology jobs and the high quality of lifestyle. Washington D.C. continues to demonstrate some resilience, although the market has not escape pricing pressure. Absorption of new supply continues, and the use of concessions, remain extremely limited in our portfolio. Applications have been running at prior year levels and the portfolio is 95.8% occupied. Moving on to New York, which continues to be one of our most challenging markets. Leasing traffic and application volume returned to 2019 levels by mid-May, but at reduced rental rates and higher levels of concessions. The leasing traffic in the city is heavily centered around local bargain hunters who are moving within the market and searching for a deal. Concession use is widespread with about 50% of our applications receiving concessions, which now average greater than one month. While the application count has recovered to prior year levels this was not enough to make up for the deficit created by the lack of volume in April. Retention started strong in the quarter but has since moderated. During June we renewed 57% of our renewal offered, which is strong by all accounts but lower than June of 2019. Our assets on the Hudson Waterfront, New Jersey, which is about a quarter of our New York exposure have performed better than Manhattan and Brooklyn. We have held 95% occupancy on the Waterfront for the past month and while concessions are being used, it's at a lower level than in Manhattan. Our New York same-store portfolio including New Jersey is about 92% occupied today. Recovery in Manhattan and Brooklyn will take some time but if office re-openings begin in early 2021 as currently expected and the city continues to show good progress on controlling the virus, we may see higher than usual demand later this year and early next year during a period when demand is typically seasonally soft. Heading over to the West Coast, Seattle delivered the strongest revenue results in the quarter both in terms of absolute revenue growth and the combined impact of new lease change and renewals. The portfolio is 95.3% occupied today and overall revenue performance has been very consistent since early April, although pricing decelerated slightly through what normally is the growth period of peak leasing season. We have not seen big layoffs in tech jobs in the market, but we are keeping an eye on employers like Amazon, who last week announced that they were extending their corporate office employees working from home until early January and have delayed new hire start dates from August into September, October. Overall, this trend may cause some short-term pressure on demand and occupancy, but could also provide a boost to the fourth quarter, which typically slows down. San Francisco's revenue performance is very different depending on the submarket, most notably between urban and suburban. Our portfolio in this market is approximately 30% urban and 70% suburban. In the city of San Francisco, we are seeing declining rents that are presently well into the double-digits year-over-year and represents the largest year-over-year decline in our entire portfolio. The city also has widespread concession use at/or above four weeks and has experienced the biggest impact from start-up layoffs and the lack of foreign immigration. Our suburban portfolio located in the Peninsula South Bay and East Bay, as well as the few urban assets that we have in those submarkets stabilized in early May. While rates are down on a year-over-year basis here, they have been holding in place for over a month with very limited use of concessions. The South Bay is still at risk as new supply enters that submarket at a time when the large tech companies have slowed growth and are trying to figure out longer term work-from-home policies. That said the San Francisco Bay Area remains a great place to live, tech companies remain a strong high wage job growth engine and the long-term outlook remains positive. Heading to Southern California, overall pricing is down in L.A. but very stable through June with very little concession used in our portfolio. L.A. is 96.1% occupied today West L.A. remains the most challenged submarket, but even here occupancy recovered to 94.1% and the Downtown submarket, which currently has supply pressure has been stable at 95%, although rent declines are the most pronounced in this submarket. Overall, we are seeing strength in the suburban submarkets of L.A., which is about 45% of our L.A. portfolio. This strength is mitigating the rate and occupancy declines in Downtown, Hollywood, Mid-Wilshire in West LA. While the high levels of competitive supply being delivered in the second half of the year, recent spike in COVID cases and the reversal a phased opening plans for the market are certainly potential short-term negatives. But content creation and technology job story in this large diverse market remains positive. We think jobs in L.A. have the potential to grow even more strongly coming out of the pandemic in order to meet the increasing demand for new online content. Finally, Orange County and San Diego are both performing well with occupancy above prior year and very limited downward pressure on rates. These are beyond challenging times, but our business is demonstrating resilience and our teams have shown that they can deliver. At this point, I will turn the call over to Bob. Bob Garechana : Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Today I will make a couple of brief remarks on same-store expenses, delinquency and bad debt, and conclude with the balance sheet. Same-store expenses declined for the quarter relative to prior year, driven by the advancements in our technology initiatives that Michael mentioned and delay or deferral of certain expenses largely stemming from the pandemic. Page 16 of the release provides detailed color on specific line items. I do want to highlight that expenses in the quarter included approximately $1 million related to one-time bonuses for our frontline workers and another $500,000 from elevated cleaning and other health and safety costs. As evidenced by our strong 97% collection rate for the quarter, our high-quality resident continues to pay their rent. That said, the combination of the small percentage of our residents that have been financially impacted by the pandemic and our conservative accounting policy has led to elevated residential bad debt in the quarter. Residential bad debt reduced revenue growth by approximately $9 million or 150 basis points in the same-store portfolio. That is about 100 basis points higher than the comparable period in 2019, which would have been a more typical level. For the next quarter or so, economic and regulatory uncertainties may lead to continued elevated bad debt. Turning to our non-residential business. I would remind you that the non-residential business is a small part of our overall operations at approximately 4% of revenues historically. But it is likely to have a disproportionate impact on total same store performance for the next few quarters. Retail tenant collections were about 60% for the quarter with collections trending slightly higher in June. Uncollected amounts that were deferred were almost entirely reserved against during the quarter from the financial statement standpoint. About two-thirds of the decline in non-residential revenues quarter-over-quarter stemmed from these reserves and other bad debt related items. Much like in residential, we have applied a relatively conservative accounting policy. This business is likely to continue to face challenges and we expect that the third quarter could be even tougher given likely delays in reopening activity and the potential lack of additional government small business stimulus. If retail performance continues to be stressed, we expect that a significant portion of the straight line non-residential receivable disclosed on page 11 could be at risk and therefore could be written-off. Finally a quick highlight on our fortress-like balance sheet. We enter the pandemic from a position of strength and have further enhanced our position through thoughtful refinancing activity and incremental debt reduction from disposition proceeds. By taking these steps, we have ensured sufficient liquidity and incremental debt capacity for any opportunities that may present themselves. We have limited near-term maturities, modest development spend and incredible access to capital. With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark. Mark Parrell : Thanks, Bob. And a final note while we fully acknowledge that the next few quarters will be difficult, the cities in which we operate have shown great resilience over time and while some of them are certainly challenged today, we believe that they will bounce back when we reach the other side of this pandemic. We expect that these cities will remain at the center of the knowledge-based economy and will continue to attract high income renters. We think that the obituaries for the great urban centers have been written much too prematurely. The world's great cities have continued to adapt and thrive over time and they will do so again. We appreciate the continued support we have received from the investment community as we navigate the current storms and look forward to coming out of this pandemic well-positioned for long-term growth. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question today and that is from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Please go ahead with your question. Rich Hightower : Hey, good morning, guys. Hope everybody is doing well. Michael Manelis : Morning. Mark Parrell : Morning. Rich Hightower : So a lot of ground we could cover on this, but I'll try to limited to a couple of questions here. So thanks for taking the questions. But just to go back to the topic of renewal rents for a second. So I wanted to back up to one of Michael's comments, I guess 20% of renewals for July and August you said included a slight increase. Does that imply that 80% roughly are flat to negative? And then are you, sort of, seeing increasingly bold asks among your tenants on the renewal side specifically given that it's probably a pretty well informed tenant base? Michael Manelis : Yeah. Hey, Rich. This is Michael. So I guess, I would start and say really for the past couple of months the performance in renewals has been relatively consistent. So the comment about 20% having in increase that's the quotes going out the door. And you need to remember we're still subject to a lot of various rent freezes in place. So you are correct 80% of our offers that went out for July and August include no increase. The negotiation process has been very consistent. We're kind of quoting about a one and we're achieving about a negative one. So about a 200 basis point spread on that performance. Rich Hightower : And that negative one that's inclusive of any concessions just to clarify that. Michael Manelis : Yeah. So we're not doing a lot of renewal concessions or we haven't been in the portfolio. I think we've seen a handful in the quarter in New York but it's very insignificant dollar amounts. Rich Hightower : Okay. That is helpful. And then just a quick one on capital allocation. Mark I know that you said in your prepared comments that the pricing that was achieved on the dispositions in 2Q is not really reflective of I guess private market reality today. But where do you see that spread between private market today and EQR's implied trading cap rate and then where the share repurchases potentially fit into the capital allocation strategy? Mark Parrell : Wow Rich that's a compound question. Thank you for that. So we'll start by just talking -- That's all right I will just talk about values and we'll start with the private market. I mean in the quarter, there just hasn't been that much activity. We think activity in our markets for our kinds of assets meaning assets with over 50 units that are of our type of quality, we're probably down 70% in the second quarter. So what I'm about to tell you is based on pretty limited volume. But it seems to us that the private market values have held in there. So we've seen a few deals trade in Downtown Seattle stuff in North side of the suburban Denver, Complex in Washington D.C. and the Virginia side then a couple of these New York deals that we've been watching, but they haven't closed. Those are all trading at values that indicate to us that the pandemic has not taken private market values down or not taken them down very much at all. But again, very small sample sizes in fairness. And then you asked about share repurchases. Well certainly the company rarely trades at this significant a discount to NAV. I mean this is very unusual for us. I'm not at all dismissive of share buybacks I would just tell you that you start as a REIT with the inability to retain earnings. So -- and you start also with the ability to return capital through a pretty large dividend. Our annual dividend is $900 million of capital returned to shareholders every year. So I'd say to you that we're open to it, we have a $13 million share allocation on the share buyback side, that's a conversation we'll continue between the Board and myself and we'll think more on that. But I will say this is pretty unprecedented for us to trade at this discount. And I think again as far as I can tell private market value changes don't justify. Rich Hightower : Okay. Thanks very much. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question and that is from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead with your question. Michael Bilerman : Hey, it's Michael Bilerman here with Nick. Mark, you had quoted an opportunistic mindset in the press release. And I wanted if you could sort of drill down a little bit about what you are implying about having an opportunistic mindset, is it acquisition, is it sale of more assets, is it strategic portfolio reallocations you just talked about stock buybacks what does it encompass? Mark Parrell : Yeah. Thanks for that question, Michael. It's sort of all of the above. I mean, again, not much going on in the transaction market there is not much of an opportunity for us to demonstrate that opportunistic mindset. But historically, this company is an equity company has always been looking for opportunities to purchase assets at prices that we think will create long-term value. About a year or year and a half after the great financial crisis you saw us by a lot of assets you were part of the industry then so you remember that. We are only four months into the pandemic it feels like a lot longer, but it has only been four months. I'd expect that at some point there would be opportunities maybe their development deals that need to be completed or at least stopped we're quite good at that. Maybe there are opportunities in retail where you've got a lots on existing retailer big boxes that have closed that we can knock down and reposition as apartments or whatnot. So we're open to all of that. I mean I just answered the question on the share buyback that's certainly something we'll keep in mind as well. Michael Bilerman : If it sounds being opportunistic is much more on the deployment of capital rather than trying to narrow the gap if you believe your stock trading to big discount selling off a substantial or maybe insubstantial amount of assets and sort of narrow the gap that way? It sounds like you want to be more externally focused than internally focused. Mark Parrell : I'll take your question I mean whether we could sell enough assets for example and buy enough stock back to close the gap on NAV. And I guess I'd say to you, I don't see that as possible. I think the company is just too large and when you start selling assets and start implicated large tax gains, you start to create other issues you also need to scale the business differently. So I'd tell you, I don't see as likely that we would do a massive stock buyback in an attempt to kind of close that NAV gap. I think what you're likely to see if we do a share buyback is that we just think it's a good investment and a good trade and doesn't preclude other opportunities because that's the big thing on REITs, because you are using capital that you are rather borrowing or you are selling assets, you are changing your opportunity set. And you might make it harder a year from now to take advantage of some of those opportunities we just spoke about. Michael Bilerman : Right. The second question I wanted to ask was just in terms of your commentary around cities and urban versus suburban environments and I think you made the comment that we shouldn't write off cities at this point urban environments and I want to sort of drill down in terms of what's your sort of forecast on when city start to recover because clearly there has been a substantial amount of home buying in suburban and generally employers follow talent and if that talent is leaving the urban environments as evidenced by your trend that you talking about in New York City in Brooklyn and in San Francisco. Why wouldn't the corporation's ultimately then move to that over time? Mark Parrell : Yeah I think... Michael Bilerman : And the whole changing nature too of where people are living if they're exiting even at the wealthier aspects and moving where those decision makers may move to. And so what gives you the confidence that it may rebound quicker than what the market is expecting? Mark Parrell : So we think about that is both the short-term and a long-term question. I mean in the short run in some of these dense urban centers, the ones that Michael just mentioned that are pressured, you are certainly seeing people say, these aren't the urban centers I want to live in right now, because they're not energized, they're not as activated. Over time the pandemic will go away, when is a really good question, but if it isn't. I mean, there will be a point where this pandemic will go away or be lessen and then these cities will open up, and there will be an opportunity for people to move back. And I think our sort of resident who again is someone who has an average household income of $164,000, who at a median age of 33, who's going to work a long day in the biotech industry or as a lawyer or maybe even as a Research Analyst, and they're going to get home at seven or eight o'clock at night, and they're going to say I want to do something with my life, I want to be active and energetic in the market. I don't value just this sedentary lifestyle. So I think the actions that we're seeing that are hurting us right now in our urban centers are all about the here and now. I think as this pandemic wanes, and again, I can't tell you when that is, but it isn't forever then there will be a turn and there will be interest in these markets again, because I don't think anything's changed in the long run. There is still huge network benefits. If you're in the content creation business, there's a lot of benefit being in Los Angeles. If you're in the technology business, there's a lot of benefit to being in Seattle or in San Francisco and the same in the financial field in New York, I think those networks benefits combined with the fact that our demographic tends to value excitement and energy and the urban centers a lot, I think they will be there and work-from-home is a fair question and all of that. And I think I'd answered it by saying, Michael you've been to a lot of our properties even in the middle of the day on a Tuesday before the pandemic, there were plenty of people working from home. I don't think work-from-home and urban living are inconsistent at all. I think when you're done working home, you're happy to wander of and do those exciting things if you like to do culturally and entertainment wise in our markets. So, I guess, I'd tell you I am very confident in the long run. What I can't tell you is, because it's a public health matter is when the pandemic wanes. Michael Bilerman : Okay. Well, I was always cheerful about those people sitting in their shorts and T-shirts, while we were walking around suits. So now I have a better appreciation for what they have. Thanks for that. Mark Parrell : Yeah. But we'll see how much fun the Hamptons are in November and how great the Adirondack are in\u2026 Michael Bilerman : Don't get me wrong mighty, I am ready for an office in environment. I can't live at work anymore. Mark Parrell : There you go. And I -- go ahead, I'm sorry. Next question please. Thanks Michael. Operator : We'll take our next question and that is from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. John Pawlowski : Hey, thanks for taking the question. Michael, I appreciate your detailed thoughts on the markets. I wanted to talk a little bit more about just New York and San Fran, those markets which are being disproportionately impacted by just employers not coming back to the office. So based on what you see in terms of your schedule move-outs today in New York and San Fran and just a leading demand indicator, what does the trajectory of occupancy look like in these markets these next few months and its trajectory of rental rates as well? Michael Manelis : Well, I guess, I would say, right now, they've been very consistent, right. So the urban cores of New York and San Francisco both have been running at a 91%, 91.5% occupancy and the rates as I kind of alluded to it, they were bouncing around we go a few weeks where we find that stability point, so I think our forward outlook for the near-term is consistency on that front. We did see some shifts in like the migration patterns, so we're looking at forwarding addresses for those people that are leaving us. Both New York and San Francisco were the two markets that stood out, that saw a change in behavior from Q2 of 2020 over Q2 of 2019. And New York, typically, we would see about 35% of those residents leaving provide us a forwarding address out of state. In Q2 of 2020 that increased up to 50% and the number one state that they were going to was New Jersey. And San Francisco was a little bit different in that, we didn't really see a strong uptick in those residents that were leaving the State of California, what we saw was is in the city of San Francisco, we saw a pretty pronounced uptick in leaving the MSA and really the number one place they were going to was Santa Clara County. So they were going down. So we're seeing some changes in the patterns, but I think from a consistency and operations standpoint, we've been optimizing revenue at this 91.5% and that's probably where we would expect to see it stay for a little bit. Mark Parrell : And John, it's Mark. Just to add, there were something we put on page 3 of the release that we just want to draw your attention to. We mentioned that the July 2020 results were about equal to the June results. What we're trying to talk about the rate of change. We talked first about stabilizing occupancy in April and we did that, then we talked about what's going on with new lease and renewals. And for the most part Michael at least for two months, we've stabilized. Now we're not suggesting it is a permanent plateau, but it feels pretty good. That's what Michael means by stability. Now we're fighting the concession battle, and we're working through that and we're happy to talk about that. But it's sort of a step-by-step and I think the sense that things are in some sort of precipitous decline is not how we feel it feels like here at the company. It feels like one thing as and we've got plenty of demand, so the occupancy feels, okay. We feel okay on what our new lease rate and renewals are going to be give or take from July and June being about the same number. And then now we're going to address these concession issues and again the markets reopening are key to that. John Pawlowski : Sure, I understand. Nobody knows when the market's going to reopen. But I guess, I struggle with the consistency tone because concessions are part of the game and so somebody could argue, a lot of folks private and public operators are buying that floor and occupancy right now. So I guess the concern is New York in the fall or San Fran in the fall you start pushing up against occupancies with a neat handle So New York occupancy going 94.1% in the quarter, sounds like its 92% in July with new leases declining and then concession is getting worse. So I just, I'm struggling with the kind of floor consistency tone it's not just this call, it's other public and private operators out there as well. Michael Manelis : So maybe let me just address one thing just on concession use, because I think the markets that we've been talking about just to give you some color. I mean, the portfolio as a whole we have been very consistent about 25% of all of our applications every single week have been getting some form of concession and it's about equivalent to one month. When you look at New York, New York, we've been running about 50% of our applications receiving a concession. And for us, we're typically at about a six week concession in that marketplace and strategically going up to the two month concession. San Francisco, it's like 40% of the applications are receiving a concession, we're predominantly at four weeks and every now and then strategically we go up to six and that's been fairly consistent in our platform for the last month or so the use of concessions and I think as your comment to the fall, I don't know where we're going to be in the fall. I was kind of to alluding to the next kind of 30, 60 days is the how we think the portfolio will play out because we have a little bit of transparency into traffic application volume as well as renewals. At some point here, you're going to sit on the sidelines. So concessions continue to go up, you may just see us park ourselves right at the levels I'm talking about and you may have occupancy kind of decline in the fourth quarter. But I don't know yet how to kind of think about that, I'm kind of forward thinking for the next quarter and how we want to run the portfolio. John Pawlowski : Okay, great. Last one from me, could you share what economic occupancy is currently in L.A. versus the physical given the concerns around eviction moratorium's getting extended? Bob Garechana : Yeah. Hey, John, it's Bob. So for economic occupancy in Los Angeles, specifically and I'm going to give you the quarter numbers so Q2 of 2020, we're at 93.7% that's compared to 94.7% physical occupancy. So about 100 basis point delta. You're correct that Los Angeles is where we've seen the higher delinquency pattern and that corresponded to the higher bad debt write-off. And while we're at it, if you want, I thought I also might talk a little bit about because I know in different notes. We've seen kind of comparability related to both kind of concessions, accounting for concessions and bad debt as well if that makes sense, John to kind of maybe walk the group through that. When looking at bad debt because I think there is some comparability concerns or issues I think it's important that we first kind of take our approach and understand what our policy is so I wanted to take the opportunity to explain that. On the residential side, we continue to apply the same policy we've applied for many years and our policy is as follows; we write-off all of our former resident account balances once they move out. So if you vacated the unit we write it off, a 100% of anything that you owed us and those accounts convert to a cash basis. For residents that continue to occupy the units but still owe us money, we write-off a 100% of their account balance once they reach three times their monthly rent. So from that point forward we convert to a cash basis. So we think that's helpful to understand, we also think it's helpful to understand what the net receivable balance is as of the end of the quarter which we provided in the release. For residential, our net receivable balance before security deposits was about $11.7 million and after security deposit it's about $9 million or a 150 basis points of quarterly revenues. And so in the second quarter, same store reported revenue growth, which I talked about in my prepared remarks, was reduced by about one percentage point overall consistent with this policy. Going into the third quarter, we expect that the bad debt will remain elevated as I mentioned in our residential business. But if collection rates remain the same and consistent, the impact shouldn't be hugely different than the second quarter impact. We continue to be remaining \u2013 we continue to remain diligent on writing off those delinquent accounts. Now non-residential a little bit of a different story and it's more of a tenant-by-tenant analysis. So we continue to account for that on accrual basis but this quarter as you've heard me talk about it, we reserved against pretty much all of the unpaid rent. So effectively converting it to a cash basis and we also wrote-off a portion of the straight line receivable. We continue to monitor that straight line as I mentioned and that's consistent \u2013 that's really more a function of the future prospects of those tenants. And we have a number of those on a watch list and depending on future conditions that could write-off that could result in future write-off. So I thought that be a helpful kind of summary on bad debt because I know as you guys work through the earnings season, you're going to see a difference in kind of how people think about bad debt et cetera. And then finally kind of the other comparability item you might take note on is just concessions. So I wanted to be completely clear that in our same store reported numbers we report in line with GAAP. So what that means is that we run the straight line concession through the reported revenue numbers. And we've done that for a number of years after a general SEC publication, on kind of non-GAAP metrics and encouraging companies to do so. But I'm happy to give you kind of the cash basis numbers by market or in aggregate like I mentioned earlier. So it was a 120 basis points, so we -- so for a residential only, we reported in the second quarter, a 90 basis point decline. If that was on a cash basis, it would have been 120 basis points. If you go to market-by-market that relationship so it be would be a that relationship of being call it 30 basis points down, it's pretty consistent overall. But I'm happy to kind of give you guys those numbers by market. So Boston would have been a negative 1.7%, New York would have been a negative 1.9%, D.C would have been flat, Seattle would have been 1.5%, San Francisco would have been negative 1.4%, L.A. would have been negative 2%, Orange County would have been 90 basis points positive. And San Diego would have been flat. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color in the call, a little bit of color on comparability items. John Pawlowski : Yeah. No. That's great. Thanks very much for all the details, it's very much appreciated. Bob Garechana : Great. Operator : Thank you. We'll move on to our next question and that is from Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Richard Hill : Hey, good morning guys. Thank you for the details on the bad debt. That was one of my primary questions. And I think that was a very helpful and efficient explanation. I did want to come back to allocation of capital and maybe some of the questions at the beginning. I think there is a case to be made in a lower interest rate regime. And against the backdrop where apartment fundamentals probably still remain quite strong, over the medium to long-term that cap rates can compress. I know there hasn't been a tremendous amount of transaction volume. But I'm curious if you can talk about that. And maybe go back to the previous comments about external growth and maybe you being opportunistic about buying some properties. Does that sort of fit into your thesis in the way you're thinking about things? Mark Parrell : Yeah. Thank you for that question Rich. We had a conversation, in fact and it was a bit of an off-hand remark on my part, in the last earnings call about cap rates potentially going down. With treasury rates with 10 year at 60 basis points, when you look at the spread of the 10 year to prevailing cap rates, it's very high on a relative basis. So I do think a case can be made because of that. And because of very significant amount of capital that's to your point because of performance long-term, wants to get into the apartment business. So I think again as we talked to private folks there seems to be no lack of capital still interested they are anxious about their underwriting, they're trying to figure things out. But I think there's a lot of people that when the dust settles, will continue to want to allocate capital into the apartment side. So how that impacts external growth? Well, to get more aggressive on your exit cap rate is what your comment implies. And that means that you got to feel comfortable for us that 10 years from now, cap rates will continue to be low. So you just have to be thoughtful about that. So for us the two main inputs in being more aggressive in acquiring assets, would be our thought about growth rates of NOI and then thinking a lot at the end about exit cap rates. And right now we're not in the situation where a lot of external growth is possible. We are certainly not issuing stock at this stock price. So for us it would be mostly recycling. And I think again, we'll have an opportunity to do that because our assets will trade well. Some of them will have renovation possibilities that maybe we don't believe in but maybe the buyer believes in, which is the case in some of the assets we sold recently. And then, we'll be able to get newer stuff with less CapEx and better growth prospects. In your point have opportunities on the capital -- on the cap rate side. I mean, if cap rates compressed we're already sitting on $40 billion of real estate. I mean, I would hope that would benefit us greatly. Richard Hill : Okay, helpful. Maybe I can ask the question slightly differently, or maybe take a slightly different perspective. But I could there's obviously a tremendous amount of money on the sidelines with private equity funds, I think by our measure into $370 billion globally. Would you ever consider partnering with a private equity fund that wants to take a longer-term perspective to maybe demonstrate that your net asset value -- where your stock is trading relative net asset value is too cheap? Mark Parrell : Well, I guess I am going to have to ask you to be more specific. I mean the company doesn't lack capital. I mean if we had -- I lack currently opportunities to allocate capital. We have a ton of debt capacity if we could find say it $0.5 billion of things to buy, above what we could sell. We could easily issue debt to do that in which we are very comfortable doing so. So I don't need anybody else's capital. And I feel on that at least in the way you said it. We like joint ventures, we have a couple. We do more, if they made sense in some way. Maybe it's a risk diversification play, maybe it's because the PE firm has an opportunity lined up, they can execute on operationally. But I don't know that our PE firm would help us for example, validate the value of the company. I think people know what the company's worth, I think folks just think that the next couple of quarters we'll be tough. And so that's what the stock price is reacting to. I'm not sure, I feel like there's a lot of folks that are confused about the platforms long-term value. Richard Hill : Yeah. No understood. I was politely trying to ask a question about take private, because I do think that there is a lot of discussions, or a lot of interest from some investors about the lag in REITs and relative to private market valuations and replacement cost. But I assume that's not a question, not a question that you'd be willing to address, on a public earnings call. So, I do appreciate that the feedback. That's very helpful. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question and that is from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead with your question. Nick Yulico : Thanks. Just had a question first off, I don't know, if there's any way that you have these stats. But I'm wondering, if you had an idea of how much of your renter base has a job that is actually an office using jobs versus working in a hospital or some other type of industry, which you can't work from home? Michael Manelis : We don't really have insight into that. We capture the employer at the time of the application, but we won't have a sense right now. I think it's pretty clear, when you look through the properties that a large percentage of our resident base are working from home. Nick Yulico : Okay. And sorry, do you have that stat about how much of the portfolio right now you think are employees working from home? Michael Manelis : I don't I do not. Nick Yulico : Okay thanks. The other question was just how we should think about a typical summer leasing period right. I mean, you have \u2013 in certain markets you have students returning to school, you have internships that are created in the summer you have jobs that are created in September sometimes internships turn into jobs they start in September, a lot of that's isn't happening right now obviously. So, is there any way to kind of frame out, how much of that typical benefit from those factors you would get in the summer that probably is not going to happen this time around? Michael Manelis : Well, I don't think that there is a way to frame it out. I guess I would tell you in normal seasonal patterns we right now are at a high point in rents. So, if I look back over the past couple of years. This is about the time of the year where rents are the highest and then we start a seasonal decline in rent. And on an occupancy front you kind of have two peaks in the peak leasing season. You have this period right now and then I think what you just alluded to somewhere right around that end of August end of September you have that other high point in occupancy. And I think what we're trying to understand right now given just the demand that we see is, we could be just shifting some of this demand and we could just go longer through September, maybe even into October, where we would start to show greater gains on a year-over-year basis in applications. Doesn't mean you're not going to \u2013 you're still going to be facing pricing pressure, you're still going to be facing concessions in these markets that I've just been discussing. But you still may see a longer runway of the demand profile. And I think it's too early to know, if that really plays out, but that is clearly a possibility that could happen. Nick Yulico : Okay. That's helpful. Just lastly, I know you guys provide some info on the move-outs in New York and San Francisco, which is interesting in terms of where people are moving. Do you have any stats on when residents are leaving how many of them when you're looking at \u2013 I don't know, if you can figures this out from the following address, if you care or not, but how many are moving into a home whether it's a rental home or a for purchase home? And then, I guess I'm also wondering, how it's working right now within your own portfolio, if you're seeing any trends if you're offering incentives that make it easier to move if the tenant wants to move to a suburban location you can offer that. Any stats you have on those types of issues? Michael Manelis : Yeah. So first, I don't have insight as to whether people are moving out to go rent a home. I do get a reasons for move-out. So, if somebody is disclosing that, they're leaving us to go buy a home, we have that stat we have that stat going back in time. We typically run about 12% of those that are leaving provide that reason. Right now, I guess, I would tell you in the second quarter we actually went down a little bit for a reason for move-out to buy home. But a lot of that is just because in April nobody was leaving. I also believe in our markets homes are really expensive to buy. So while kind of we're balancing the move-outs that are occurring we're not seeing people kind of run out to go buy the homes. We did see an uptick in D.C. and Southern California markets, but it was a small increase in that percent on a year-over-year basis. Nick Yulico : Okay. Thank you, Michael. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question and that is from Alua Askarbek with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. Alua Askarbek : Just a quick one in terms of early terminations, I know you guys mentioned Boston that was an issue early on in the quarter. But have other markets kind of [Technical Difficulty] recently as more companies announce it working from home [Technical Difficulty] early terminations? Michael Manelis : So you were kind of breaking up on me. But I believe what your question is around early terminations or lease breaks. And then based on the recent announcements from a few employers have we seen anything take place, is that correct? Alua Askarbek : Yeah, yeah. Michael Manelis : Okay. So first during the quarter, we did see an increase in early terminations or lease breaks. Predominantly, in New York and Boston and very much weighted toward the month of April. If I look at the performance for May, June and even through July right now we're really are not in this period of time where we're seeing more people kind of break their leases with us. But we did experience it in the quarter. As far as the recent announcements I think it's too soon to understand it's something we're clearly watching right now. As Google just made their announcement extending kind of return to the offices until the summer of next year. It's something that we'll be watching in the South Bay and the city of San Francisco to see if we see kind of those individuals kind of leave early. But it's also most likely going to put a little pressure on the renewal conversations. And I still think in a week it's too early for us to see any pattern from that. Mark Parrell : Yeah. And I'll just add and this is just anecdotal. There are a lot of folks that as the summer wanes is going to want to be back in their normal routine. It's certainly not a bad thing especially when cities are this deactivated to maybe be it some other remote location for those who can't afford are able to do so. But it is a good number of people and I can tell you test to a 20 year old who is in my house, who is very anxious to get out of mom and dad's house and go back to her life in one of the big cities. So, I think that we're also going to see almost no matter whether the employers want it or not a stream of people that are our kind of residents slowly deciding that they've had enough of where they are and they are interested in again trying to be in a little bit more activated environment to potentially see a little bit more of the city that they move to for a reason. So, again I can't predict maybe the pandemic gets worse and that slows down again. But we've had pretty steady demand and I think Michael and I are of the general opinion without certainty being associated with it that the leasing season we'll extend itself. But it won't necessarily be vigorous going into the Q3 early Q4 period. Alua Askarbek : Got it. Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question and that is from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Please go ahead. Rich Anderson : Thanks, good morning everyone. So Bob I just want to -- just make sure -- simplify the talk about bad debt. There's three buckets every month or every quarter right. There is the 97% collection rate and then of the remaining three there is a deferral that is as recorded as collected in the month and then the bad debt reserve those are the three buckets that we have to deal with every -- depending on the period in question, is that correct? Bob Garechana : Yeah, that's correct. And I would add that the bad debt reserve isn't just the allowance for doubtful accounts. It's also the write-off of any resident who would have moved out during that period as well. Rich Anderson : Understood. Okay I just want to make sure that was clean. Bob Garechana : Correct. Rich Anderson : Talk a little bit Michael when you were kind of going through the offer at 1% and getting minus 1% on renewals. I don't expect it maybe sort of throw out is the word or the concept of maybe pushing too hard there and if you think about the math, is it greedy to ask for 1% when if you don't keep them you lose the residents you have downtime you have cost of releasing the space and then you take a 8% hit to that because of the new leasing you need to do that to get somebody in the unit. So I'm wondering if you see Equity Residential becoming a little bit more willing to negotiate downward. So you avoid some of these dynamics and take your lumps by renewing at perhaps a lower number than you're doing so far today? Bob Garechana : Yeah. Well I guess I'll point out. So first and foremost, the 20% that I cited that was receiving some form of increase for July and August. Those are residents that are actually kind of below streets today. So that's why those increases are going out. And the willingness to negotiate I mean that is part of our renewal process and we're going to make sure that we are always being cognizant of what that replacement rent is going to be. And as we're working through these negotiations I mean we go back to the fact that listen the largest thing that people want to avoid is moving. The number one reason they tell us they just don't want to move so they want to work with us. Rich Anderson : You want that also? Michael Manelis : Yeah exactly. So we're being very sensitive to the situation right now especially for those residents that have been financially harm and we're working with residents through this process. So, I think right now just looking into August and even into September, I think our increases are going to stay in this 1%. We have pockets in that suburban portfolio where we can actually start pushing rents up a little bit and those increases will start to grow a little bit. But at the same points you've got pressures that are balancing this out. So I think the process is very fluid and I agree with your point fully. And I think the way we execute is following the mindset that you just shared. Rich Anderson : Okay, fair enough. And then last question for me to Mark, EQR sort of doubled down on urban in 2016 when you sold to Barry Sternlicht the suburban portfolio and it is so now we're in this mess and you're 55% urban 45% suburban based on your definitions. I'm curious if EQR being the opportunistic entity that you described would be willing if the market sort of allow for this transaction market looked attractive enough not to see urban go down as a percent of total, but go up because you believe so fully that urban is going to come back people want to be there. Could that 55% sort of 65% rather than to 45%? That's my question. Mark Parrell : Yeah. I - Rich, we're open to buying urban or suburban. We talked about selling Manhan and we buy Manhan. We bought two assets in the suburbs in New Jersey and it just got to make sense. I mean it may have to make sense two ways the property has to make sense, the underwriting of the actual asset and I have to make sense in terms of our total exposure. If there is any small regret we have is just in some submarkets like the Upper West Side in New York, we just had a lot of units. We like New York we did need them all to be in one little area. So we're just trying to spread out a little. And that's been sort of the theme of the last few years is being in our markets but being spread out a little more. So there was an urban asset that underwrote, we wouldn't hesitate to purchase it. It just has to make sense relative to our allocation in that submarket already. Rich Anderson : Did you say 55% is more likely go down or up in the next couple of years? Mark Parrell : I was hoping that we would grow and that the urban wouldn't shrink as much as the suburban would grow. But I would think, we'll get rid of a few urban assets here. And there are some older suburban stuff. In fact this quarter both the assets we sold were suburban properties. They were older 50 plus year old suburban assets that where renovation place, but weren't -- from our perspective ones that we wanted to undertake. Rich Anderson : Okay. Excellent. Thanks very much, everyone. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question and this is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead with your question. Haendel St. Juste: Hey there, running out of good one left. Rich just took my -- one of my better ones. Hey, I wanted to ask you about the -- I wanted to ask you about cost controls, you mentioned that there is this some things you're doing here in the quarter to help same-store expenses and expect that to continue beyond of the COVID period. Can you add a bit more color or commentary around that and maybe on top of that some comment on tech investments and just quantifying what the opportunity here is, or how we should think about the potential savings either on a dollar or in fact the same-store expense basis over the next couple of years? Bob Garechana : Great. I'll start on the dollar piece and I'm going to have to take you back a few months before COVID to give you a good frame of reference to be honest with you, I think to give some color. But we had excellent expense control in the second quarter and as I kind of mentioned in my remarks, a lot of that came from the initiatives that Michael talked about. So it is the ability on our frontline, kind of, leasing and admin and other things to convert to a more digital platform to do virtual tours to be more efficient to understand our employee utilization et cetera, and that certainly helped in us achieving our goals in terms of our on-site payroll, reductions right via attritions. So that was incredibly helpful. We also in R&M experience benefits through the deployment of our mobility for our service personnel and our ability to use them as well. And so that impacts the payroll line and the R&M line, because it helps your decision making in terms of staffing. So you can staff internally as opposed to using contractors et cetera. What gets a little bit tough right is that there were other things going on related to COVID in the quarter. And so there were some deferral of expenses and some incremental expenses that I mentioned in both of those categories. But overall I think from a sustainability standpoint. we're running call it 50 to 75 basis points ahead or lower in expense growth than what we would have thought at the beginning of the year before COVID ever occurred. And that's a real positive and it's really those two items that I was talking about. Michael Manelis : Yeah. And I think your other question was regarding tech investments? Haendel St. Juste : Yes. Michael Manelis : So I think first we are involved in two different tech funds one with [indiscernible] and one with Navitas, which really kind of just helps us stay on top of the new technologies that are emerging not only in our own industry, but really other industries to see the applicability for us. And I think this is still an area that we're pretty excited about on a go-forward basis that there is still opportunities out there to improve the efficiencies of the operations in these platforms, and it will come from technology. I think later this year, we\u2019ll be deploying our sales technology piece, which is moving a 100% of our sales process to a mobile app and we're beginning piloting that shortly. Similar to what we just did on the service side of the business. You'll see us continue to move forward and explore building access, smart home access. So there's still a lot of opportunities for our industry to advance technology to increase efficiencies. Haendel St. Juste: That's helpful. Thank you. And Mark you mentioned earlier, I understand there is a few transactions on the market that have closed here they weren't likely done or they were negotiated pre-COVID, curious if you're hearing or seeing anything in the shadow market. What buyers are underwriting right now and maybe what IRRs they are targeting? And then curious on when do you think, New York City NOI returns -- same-store NOI returns positive, is that 2022 or could we be looking at 2023 here? Thanks. Mark Parrell : All right. Well, in terms of what other folks are underwriting, I would say the first question I had for the Chief Investment Officer over the course of the quarter was are we seeing more from brokers, is there actually shadow stuff going on? And the answer is a very little going on right now. So there doesn't seem to be like there's this pent up desire to sell assets in the apartment business and not a whole bunch of stuff that the brokers are looking at and hoping to get out soon of the marketplace. So I don't know if I have any insight into how other people are underwriting except that when we talked to private equity sponsors and other private real estate investors they continue to be very interested in the space. That whatever turbulence we have right now is not just persuading them from long-term interest in our space. So I think that's good. In terms of hazarding a guess on New York that requires a couple of things, I mean next year you're going to be pretty aggressive on real estate tax appeals in New York because taxes in New York for properties are in part based on their incomes and certainly we're going to all have different incomes than we had hoped for, for 2020, and we'll be looking like we did in the Great Recession for relief and we obtained that relief in our markets and we would hope to do that again. I'm not sure that's going to change 2021. There's a certain trajectory and your question implied it. These quarters, because of the rent roll is deteriorating, the quarters will keep getting worse for a while. And then that sort of rate of change on some of these new lease and renewal numbers will change. And then, the whole thing will turn around, and that just takes time. So, I really can't hazard a guess on when New York changes, especially when you talk about NOI, because that implicates for New York property taxes. So, in New York, it's very hard for me to think about how that might, but I would hope that they would be less of an increase or a little bit of a decrease in 2021. Haendel St. Juste: Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question, and that is from Alex Kalmus with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead with your question. Alex Kalmus : Thank you for taking my question. I'm looking at your concession results, are concession's consistent across the studio one-bed, two-bed product or are they over-exposed to the one-bedroom products? Michael Manelis : Well, I guess I would tell you in the urban cores there. They're are pretty much sitting on most of the unit types there. We are seeing the lowest occupancy in our studios, specifically in like downtown or Manhattan areas, City of Boston. Those unit types are pressured, but the concessions right now are pretty much across the board on Unit types. The ones that are being used I think the demand coming in. We are seeing demand for one-bedroom. We're also seeing demand for two-bedroom. So I think the concessions flowing through to the revenues are probably slanted more toward the one and two bedrooms than the studios, just because the application count on studios is not as high. Alex Kalmus : Got it, makes sense. And just taking a three to five year view, considering the shifting demographics and the millennial older cohort moving to the suburbs potentially for single-family homes, because they are now having kids and a softer Generation Z coming up, would you rather be overweight any one of these products in particular. Mark Parrell : So, it's Mark. I guess I like having a variety of these. I mean I think studios have an advantage of being the lowest price ticket. So, the pandemic, again, feels like it's gone on forever and will continue at some point it won't. And then people who are new to a market and new to their job and maybe working their way up as a professional, will look to a studio as a great way to get on trend in the big cities. So, I'm happy to own a little bit of a variety of these products. I wouldn't want to own all two's, all one-bedroom, all of anything. And so we've tried to be thoughtful about low ticket. So we do have a good number of studios and one-bedrooms in the markets. But, we do have plenty of twos and a few threes. These large unit types are hard for us to clear. I'll tell you consistently. We have a harder time renting three and four-bedroom units in our buildings, and they tend to be competing against luxury product and condos and stuff. So, I think studios ones and twos are where it's at for us and I'd like a nice mix of that notwithstanding your comment. And I would point out I mean Gen Z is a very large group as well, and we don't know their preferences, but I have a few of them living with me, and they talk a lot about both moving out to my house and moving to a city. Alex Kalmus : Make a lot of sense. Thank you very much. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question, and that is from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. John Kim : Thank you. You guys mentioned a limited amount of concessions that you are offering on renewals. I have noticed that you change your definition on renewal rent growth to no longer being effective growth number? And I'm just wondering why you changed that definition? Bob Garechana : So we haven't changed the definition. We've always given renewal rate growth excluding concessions, and we also have given new lease excluding concessions as well. What we gave you instead to gave you a concept. And in the past, to be honest with you, the concessions were selling immaterial that, neither one of those numbers or the blended rate would have been any different. What we gave you in addition this quarter is we gave you the effective blended lease rate, which is with the impact of the concessions. So you can see the blended impact with and without concessions. John Kim : Is that something that you could break out going forward by market? Mark Parrell : So your request is to see renewal rates by market net of renewal concessions? John Kim : Well, I guess the effective rental growth rate by markets, which would be... Bob Garechana : The blended rate. John Kim : The blended rate, correct. Mark Parrell : Sure. Bob Garechana : We'll take that. We can take that. John Kim : Have you discussed your plans for your retail or your non-residential part of your portfolio? Do you plan to just retain that as a retail, or is there a potential to convert this to others? Mark Parrell : Yeah. I mean we're still working through things with our retail tenants. We're hopeful we're able to save a few of those folks as the city try to reopen. But one of the conversations we've had as a group several times now is in properties, and this alluded to the question Michael just addressed a moment ago. In these markets where we do have buildings that have studio apartments, could we repurpose of the retail as office space for those studio folks. As amenity space they could go to, a lounge of sorts, is that something that would be useful, you would need to put a lot of TI in that, that's just some lounge furniture and really good Internet connection. And again, not office space for the general public. But could you get a change of use in that retail and that would likely require rezoning and so it's kind of easier said than done. But that is intriguing to me, as you see retail footprint shrink in general. The idea of having unslightly vacant retail isn't very appealing. And the idea of taking on additional retail risk isn't that exciting. So maybe there is an opportunity here to be at service to our existing residents, put our square footage to use. So that's one of the ideas we've been kicking around. John Kim : Okay great. Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question and that is from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead with your question. Alexander Goldfarb : Hello. Good morning and thank you. Mark certainly appreciate your comments on the premature arbitrary for urban. Certainly a healthy discussion, but you brought up an interesting point of your children living at home, looking to get out and live in the cities. Right now, you guys said your average ages 33 with average income, I think, you said $160,000. If there is sort of a shift here, were that older demographic, sort of, moves out and buys homes. And then the cities are still populated by the young singles, you feel that your portfolio as is positioned right now at the price point is commensurate to, let's say, a late '20s crowd that's not earning that $160,000 that may only be earning, let's say, upper $90,000s or $100,000. Just sort of curious, if there is a generational shift, how you feel that your portfolio would line-up to that from a price standpoint? Mark Parrell : Yeah. I'd start by saying, for example, in New York City, only 10% of our residents have children. So notwithstanding the age list you had, we also have people in their 20\u2019s who are earning a good living, or people in our one-bedrooms who are two people, right, they\u2019re a couple of living there. So, I guess, that's certainly a theory, but it's not anything we've sort of seen. I mean, these are really deep. When you look at the number of people in these markets making over $100,000 or $150,000 that's one the thing that's really exciting about our markets. This is a really big group of people. When you go to some of the smaller markets, you have a good growth of that number of high earners as renters. But it's just a small absolute number, Alex, and I worry that most of those folks are going to buy homes anyway. So, I guess, I'd tell you, I appreciate the theory, I\u2019ve not seen any evidence of it. And our demographic doesn't tend to be like seemingly that anxious to buy a home. I mean, we are seeing a little in New York, as Michael said, folks moving out of New York City and out of New York proper. But they're mostly moving in New Jersey and I wonder if, when they get the all clear sign, some of them don't go back to Manhattan. So I just -- I'm not as convinced as you are that this is some sort of permanent change the pandemic has brought. I think the pandemic has put a lot of people on their heels about living in an urban environment right at the moment, especially in the summer. And I think people will constantly reappraise that decision. I mean, I lived in a city for a reason before. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then, the second question is, just thinking to the November election. Clearly, New York underwent a change when democrats took over Albany in 2018. Given some of the rhetoric on the progressive platform, do you guys have concerns about increased regulation on housing and moratoriums and rent control, etcetera, if the dems win the Senate and the White House? And how do you think the industry is sort of preparing itself based on lessons learned over the past few years? Mark Parrell : Yeah it's a good question. I put aside the party labels and the rest and just speak to policy. I mean, I do think that additional regulatory burdens and are a fair number of those that are being added in our markets, some of them related to this valid COVID emergency and some of us -- some of them seem almost opportunistic by activist groups to me. These are just going to restrict the amount of investment in housing. And that's the message we're trying to get across, as these limits you're putting in place, which kind of feel emotionally good to some folks, are just not going to work, that they're going to end up with housing at substandard, there is going to be less build, that it's all bad. And some of these ideas, again, and I think it's in the house package, so I believe it's a democrat idea, is to give the state money in bulk grants for the states to pass out directly to landlords or folks that are under stress from COVID. So, again, I don't know what will end up in the final package, but I think the idea of upholding the system and encouraging it to produce additional units. So I'd say what the industry is doing right now, is trying to do a little bit of an education campaign to have conversations with people about what's effective regulation and what isn't. And then, trying to help think that through. Could there be some zoning reform? Could there be more affordable units built with market rate? Could we address it that way, as oppose to these sort of rent regulation, some of the other stuff that folks have floated, that economists universally say, it's going to end up creating more problems than solutions for sure. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you, Mark. Mark Parrell : Thank you, Alex. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference back over to Mark Parrell for any closing comments. Mark Parrell : We thank you all for your time on the call and have a good rest of the summer. Good day.",

At this time, I'd like to turn things over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Please go ahead, sir. Marty McKenna : Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's third quarter 2020 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; and Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer. Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer is with us as well for the Q&A. Please be advised that, certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now, I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. I will start by thanking my 2,700 Equity Residential colleagues across the country for all they have done this year to take care of our residents and run the business under often trying circumstances. I appreciate your tireless work in meeting the needs of prospects and residents, in an environment that has been constantly changing. Shifting to the business. Our third quarter results reflect the challenges posed by the continuing health crisis and the impact it has had on living and working in the urban centers of our markets. The approximately 23% of our portfolio located in Downtown San Francisco, Manhattan and Brooklyn and Downtown, Boston and Cambridge continue to be the most impacted. When we last spoke with you in late July on our second quarter call, we were seeing demand in excess of 2019 levels and renewals that were at or near 2019 levels, albeit with significant rent reductions and concessions, leading to occupancy being generally stable. As we went through August and early September, we continue to experience good demand, but turnover increased significantly pressuring occupancy. The timing of these turnover increases PAUSE generally with the announcements by employers of delays in bringing employees back to offices, as well as incidence of civil unrest. This occupancy pressure in turn caused further rent declines and increased concessions. So far October has been broadly similar, though we have seen scattered positive signs in the form of modestly improved renewals and higher application volumes. I caution, however, that market conditions remain too volatile and the timing of developments on mitigating the virus too unclear to suggest that we have turned a corner. All that being said, we are heartened by the demand we see for our product, even in urban centers, where life has been significantly impacted by the pandemic. We also see recent office leasing activity by technology firms, as well as activity by financial services office users as a long-term vote of confidence in our urban centers. We believe that the knowledge-based economy will continue to drive growth in the U.S. and that our markets with their massive installed base of universities, innovative companies, venture capital firms, and the many other things that make a knowledge economy grow not to mention renowned entertainment and cultural amenities, will keep them at the center of this activity. The cities in which we do business, and in which many of you live and work, will again be attractive places for affluent long-term renters to live work and play once the pandemic wanes. The impact of the pandemic on increasing the ability of many office workers to remote work is certainly a fascinating new trend, whose long-term impact is difficult to gauge. But no matter what it does to longer-term office demand, we feel that our relatively young demographic craves both work proximity and proximity to the entertainment and cultural amenities in our cities, which we think will remain very attractive to affluent renters once our cities reopen fully. Also, supply in urban centers should in the midterm decline sharply, as developers, lenders and investors react to market conditions and construction costs that have not declined as of yet. While we are not providing earnings guidance, we do want you to be aware that our financial results will weaken over subsequent quarters, as the full impact from the pandemic works its way through our rent roll. Lower lease rates take some time to fully manifest themselves in our reported same-store revenue numbers, because at any one time our rent roll is made up of both new leases with lower rents and leases that were signed at higher rents prior to the beginning of the pandemic. As the composition of our rent roll changes to include more of these lower rate leases our same-store revenue results decline. The opposite is true on our way back up. Occupancy change is causing much quicker shift in the trajectory of our reported revenue numbers. In the meantime, the combination of our portfolio diversity and strong balance sheet will allow us to weather this challenging operating environment. For EQR recovery is a matter of when, not if. A quick note on collections. We continue to have strong results. We are collecting about 97% of our rents and resident payment behavior has not changed. That said, we had increased residential bad debt costs in this quarter, reflecting the fact that although in the aggregate there's only a small number of residents who have stopped paying since the pandemic began. We had a peak in July of those that reached our three-month non-payment threshold and their full balances were written off. From that point forward, only a small number of new non-payers have surfaced, so while we will continue to deal with elevated bad debt and will likely not be to the same extent seen in our third quarter numbers. On a similar note, the write-off of non-residential straight-line rent amounts in the quarter was large and lumpy and should not reoccur going forward. My final comment will be on investment activity. We closed on one acquisition in the quarter 158 unit property in suburban Seattle, and easy commuting distance for the growing job center of Bellevue. The purchase price was $48.9 million. The property is a brand-new asset in lease-up, and we expect a year two cap rate upon completion of the lease-up to be 4.7%. This is the only asset that we have purchased this year versus approximately $750 million in 2020 property sales. And this purchase is a continuation our strategy of buying urban and suburban properties, with affluent well-employed residents, the acquisition of which we believe will lead to attractive long-term cash flow and unlevered IRR growth. We will continue to buy properties using proceeds from selling assets and we think have weaker prospects, due to property condition or location or where the buyer is willing to pay a price that exceeds our estimate of fair value. I will now turn the call over to Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer to walk you through the markets in detail and then we'll take your questions. Michael? Michael Manelis : Thanks Mark. Let me start by thanking our employees for their dedication and hard work during the third quarter. This has been a year like no other and their commitment to their residents, their colleagues has been tremendous. The third quarter saw better overall demand for our apartments both urban and suburban. Suburban assets are holding up relatively well while our urban assets are producing higher turnover leading to decreased rental rates, increased use of concessions, and lower occupancy. Overall, this quarter's performance was determined as much by the density of the location urban or suburban as by the market. As we previously discussed, a little over half of our portfolio is urban, while the remainder is suburban. On a positive note, the improvement in demand across all locations resulted in a 5% increase in year-over-year movements. Resident turnover, however, was a more challenging story. After eight consecutive quarters of improving resident turnover, the third quarter of 2020 was the first quarter where the number of residents moving out increased on a year-over-year basis. Resident turnover continued to decline in the suburban markets, but the increased turnover in the urban markets more than offset this improvement. On the renewal side, as we sit here today, we are renewing just over 50% of our residents with approximately 35% of our fourth quarter renewal offers being issued with some renewal increase mostly in the suburban submarkets. Portfolio-wide occupancy is currently running just above 94%. The suburban portfolio is around 96% with the urban portfolio slightly below 93%. As I mentioned, the good news is that we continue to see more people looking for our apartments than last year. As disclosed in the release, applications at the company level were up 20% over last year in the quarter, driven by outsized growth in the urban core and this growth accelerated in October, define normal seasonal slowing. Given the amount of inventory we have available to sell in our urban portfolio, we will need to maintain this velocity through the fourth quarter or reduce turnover in order to continue to hold portfolio-wide occupancy at 94%. A stabilization and an improvement of our occupancy is what would allow us to dial back concessions and begin increasing rates. Much like applications, turnover, and occupancy, the pricing story is also bifurcated between urban and suburban. In the urban markets, pricing continued to trend down and concession usage increased throughout the quarter. 70% of the portfolio-wide concessions used during the quarter were in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Boston and Cambridge, and Downtown San Francisco. The volume of new leases is strong in these submarkets, however, price prospects continued to be very price-sensitive. Previous addresses provided on applications suggest that the large majority of these new residents are deal seekers who are moving to us from within the same market. In the suburban markets, concession use was rare and pricing was fairly stable throughout the quarter with a few submarkets beginning to show modest year-over-year growth particularly in Southern California. Now, let me move on to some market-specific commentary. Starting with Boston, elevated vacancy levels at existing properties and the inopportune recent delivery of new supply in the city will continue to challenge Boston's near-term performance. While concession use remains elevated in the city in Cambridge it has been consistent since July with about four to six weeks being the norm. Leasing activity is predominantly coming from intra-city moves with the lack of international students and workers continuing to pressure rates. Currently, we have seen some very early signs of stability with no incremental declines in rates for the last several weeks and marginal improvement in occupancy. Boston is typically highly seasonal and these albeit early signs are bucking that typical trend. For the market to fully stabilize, it will require continued improvement in the demand drivers to aid and absorption of the new supply that is being delivered currently and anticipated in 2021. New York continues to be one of the markets' hardest hit by the pandemic and we still see residents leaving the city to wait it out. During the quarter, leasing activity was driven by deal seekers or intra-city moves who represented approximately 75% of total move-ins. This is up 15 percentage points over last year. Meanwhile, the elevated move-outs continued with most of our residents moving to the surrounding states with suburban New Jersey capturing the largest share. In our conversations with New York-based employers and based on Mark and My's recent visit to New York, you can see early signs of the city trying to reenergize. While overall activity in the city remains meaningfully suppressed, there are absolutely a few areas where things are starting to feel a little better, specifically the Upper West and East side submarkets. Other submarkets notably Midtown, Chelsea, SoHo, and the financial district have a long way to go. Overall, we've noticed a brief period of stability beginning in late September and through October which is far better than the weekly sequential declines we experienced throughout the entire second quarter and much of the third. Currently, we are defining the usual seasonal drop-off in applications and are achieving outsized growth in weekly application counts. We have also recently seen a slowing in the pace of move-outs. However, we will continue to feel pressure on occupancy until move-outs fully normalize. Our occupancy in the market is just below 90%. Studio apartments which were once our highest occupied unit type prior to the pandemic are now our lowest at 88%. We are getting ready to furnish a few of these as many offices available for our residents who are working from home and we're going to test the demand for renting these spaces in hourly blocks of time. The good news is that New York is resilient and we strongly believe that it will remain a top destination for highly educated workers. We hear anecdotally from our local teams that residents intend to return when we get to the other side of this pandemic. Declines in rates have made living in Manhattan more affordable and that could be a catalyst to bringing people back. The broader recovery in this market will be fueled by a lack of competitive new supply and the continued growth of big tech employers in this market. Many of these tech firms continue to expand their investments in this market, even during the pandemic, supporting the view that the city will continue to thrive as it has in the past post pandemic. Moving to D.C., which is holding up better than our other East Coast markets, but performance during the quarter moderated due to slowing Class A multifamily absorption. The market benefits from federal government employment, which has actually seen a net increase over the last 12 months, but the overall job growth has declined. The ability of our residents to pivot to work from home has allowed us to maintain occupancy with concession use that was relatively low in the quarter. We are seeing some increase in concession use and pricing pressure in this market and expect performance to moderate through the fourth quarter, partly due to normal seasonality, but also due to the continued competitive pressure from new supply. Heading over to the West Coast. Seattle began the year with strong expectations based on elevated job growth and a favorable competitive supply landscape in the downtown area for the second consecutive year. In addition, Seattle's median income within the city limits increased by 10% and crossed the $100,000 a year threshold, which makes it the third major city to do so. While Seattle was initially impacted in March by COVID, its performance through late July was very stable. Social unrest in the city and extended work from home announcements in late July and August, however, began impacting our performance, especially our ability to retain residents in the CBD Belltown and Capitol Hill submarket. Overall, market occupancy is now just below 95%, with elevated turnover during the quarter that was heavily concentrated in the Capitol Hill and CBD Belltown submarkets. Concessions, which were hardly used previously, are now starting to be seen in stabilized assets, mostly in these submarkets. Eastside properties are also using concessions, but with a lower frequency and properties to the north continue to be in the best overall shape with good year-over-year growth in the Bothell Mill Creek submarket. Overall, housing prices continue to rise at a fast pace. And along with the other factors just discussed, we would expect this market to quickly bounce back post pandemic. San Francisco is our most challenged market, although it is not the same everywhere. Overall, occupancy is now below 93%, while our downtown assets are 87%, East Bay is 96%, and both Peninsula and South Bay are currently at 94%. Since mid-March, the downtown portfolio has been pressured on rate with escalating concession use. Concessions at two months are now common downtown and what used to be a 15% to 20% rent premium between Downtown San Francisco and new supply in Downtown, Oakland is now flat to a 5% discount. As we think about the future, San Francisco should recover when there is more clarity on tech company's long-term plans regarding office versus work-from-home policies, and an improved quality of life in the downtown area. Supply in 2021 will continue to be concentrated in Oakland and the South Bay. South Bay supply may challenge operations even further, unless the tech workers resume living in closer proximity to their offices. One small positive from the declines in rental rate is that, it has made the city of San Francisco, a more affordable place to live, potentially attracting more people back into the city. During October, we saw outsized growth in applications and a slight improvement in renewals. This, in turn, led to slower declines in pricing in our downtown portfolio. In Los Angeles, the urban portfolio maintained occupancy around 95% through the quarter, while contending with continued pressure from new supply in the Downtown, Koreatown Mid-Wilshire Corridor. West L.A. continues to feel pressure from the slow restart of online content creation. Overall, pricing including the use of concessions has been stable since mid-September, while the application activity has continued to grow. The suburban portfolio continues to show signs of improvement with occupancy staying at or near 97%. The suburban submarkets of Inland Empire Santa Clarita Valley and Ventura County are all experiencing modest year-over-year gains in rental income. That being said, we expect the overall portfolio to modestly improve through the quarter, primarily driven by continued rate improvement in the suburban submarkets. It is only fitting that I conclude our market updates with Orange County and San Diego, which stand out for their resilience through the pandemic. While our portfolio in these markets consist primarily of suburban assets, and were certainly impacted by the pandemic, they have consistently sustained occupancy above 96.5% collectively, while also improving the percent of residents renewing their leases. Both markets have year-over-year revenue gains and are expected to sustain or strengthen their performance through the fourth quarter. Overall, we haven't seen anything that leads us to believe, that the trends just discussed are likely to change meaningfully in the near term. The suburban portfolio should continue to outperform with some potential improvement in pricing and relatively stable occupancy. The urban markets will likely continue to be challenged, particularly Manhattan Brooklyn, City of Boston and Cambridge and Downtown San Francisco, where continued pressure from the increased turnover and a highly concessionary operating environment impact performance. As detailed in the release and in my remarks, we have seen tentative signs of improvement in some of the metrics in these markets, but pricing remains under significant pressure. We will need to see occupancy begin to improve and pricing to stabilize to feel like we have turned a corner. Our urban properties in Washington D.C., Seattle and L.A. will likely continue to see slight moderation in both rate and occupancy, with potentially more pressure in Seattle, where some signs of weakness have come into play of late. While the economic uncertainty and the extended impact from the pandemic have made it difficult to predict what a recovery looks like and when it may occur, we remain optimistic on a number of fronts including the ability to grow rate in our suburban portfolios, continued demand for our product regardless of location and solid collection performance. Our ongoing efforts will continue to seek out those opportunities to improve performance while ensuring the well-being of our employees and residents. Thank you. At this time I will turn the call back over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll hear first today from Nick Joseph with Citi. Nick Joseph : Thanks. Mike I appreciate all the details. You mentioned at the end that the trends are not likely to change in the near-term. So I'm wondering what the historical relationship has been between applications, which you are seeing pick up particularly in October for the urban core and ultimately occupancy or net effective new lease rate change? Michael Manelis : Well, I guess I would think about it this way, which is the volume of applications on a year-over-year basis is improving and it's strong but again there is seasonality to applications right? So applications are the highest in the third quarter and will drop-off in the fourth quarter. As we think about that relationship to new lease change, obviously, if we can continue this extended leasing season that we're seeing throughout the balance of October and November that should start stabilizing that occupancy and give us the ability to start dialing back some of the concession use and then ultimately try to pressure test increasing rates back up a little bit. But I think it's still too early to see what's going to happen for the balance of the quarter. But I think right now looking at where we sit at the end of October, we feel pretty good that we're seeing this extended leasing season continue. We just don't know how much longer it will continue for. Nick Joseph : Thanks. And then I appreciate all the additional disclosure, and I certainly understand the lease role and the seasonality in the current operating environment, but given how much price transparency there is in the market, how many tenants with in-place leases are you seeing trying to renegotiate? And then how are you handling that? Michael Manelis : Well, so I think there's two aspects to that. So first is transfer. So people that are on a current lease, seeing what's available in their building and trying to move intrally, so we did see an increase in our transfer activity through the quarter. We raised our transfer fees in early April trying to mitigate some of that activity but ultimately a large percentage of those residents that are transferring are actually moving to a larger unit that has an increase in rent still. And then on the other side at the end of the lease, you are still seeing some folks trying to trade units and really going after kind of more space. So people that were in studios moving to the one-bedroom et cetera, and again at that point we're doing our best to negotiate with them to keep them in place in their current unit, but ultimately we want to retain them in as a resident. So we're going to do what we need to do to keep them. Nick Joseph : And how about just on pure lease breaks either saying, we're looking at a unit and saying, okay, this unit is now down 20%. I may end up just moving out and paying a lease break versus renegotiated mid-lease. Michael Manelis : Yeah. So early lease terminations are -- continued to be elevated on a year-over-year basis we're up about 25% year-over-year. Sequentially we definitely saw July like ticked down from June, but then the announcements from the large tech companies an extended work-from-home policies and the civil unrest in the cities in early August resulted in early terminations increasing in the month of August. So far September and October remain elevated on a year-over-year basis but they're not as high as they are in August. Mark Parrell : And just to add Nick it's Mark. We do receive lease termination payments from residents who terminate leases early. So depending on the jurisdiction that could be continuing to pay on your lease or paying us two to three months right then and there as a lease termination cost. So there is the same elevated number, but it isn't like a free option for the resident to exercise. Nick Joseph : Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : We'll hear next from John Pawlowski with Green Street. John Pawlowski : Thanks. Mark, the first question is just on the private market values in some of your hardest hit urban cores. So if you went out and JVed or sold outright your Manhattan portfolio or your San Francisco portfolio today, would there be a sufficient bid do you think? And how would values look versus pre-COVID? Mark Parrell : Yeah. Thanks John. I guess I'll do a quick survey and just say that if you're in the suburbs and I think this is consistent with you and others have written if you're suburban property owner of a B-property quality asset with a renewal -- or excuse me a renovation potential that probably the asset's worth a little bit more than it was pre pandemic. Class A suburban's probably about the same as it was pre pandemic. The urban stuff in San Francisco and New York would be very hard to trade. I mean, we still see total volume in the third quarter is down 60% for our kinds of assets. And even more so in New York and San Francisco. And I can't even point to completed deals to tell you what the mark is. So I'd say those markets are pretty illiquid. It's I think very logical to assume there's been some reduction in value. My guess is it's going to end up being pretty modest because a lot of folks like us who own in those markets aren't compelled sellers. And because of that you won't see us putting those assets into the market. So I think what you're probably guessing at some modest reduction in value in New York and San Francisco for sure. If we were trying to do a transaction frankly right at this moment I'm not sure how well that would go. I just think people are trying to underwrite declining rents, trying to understand the health crisis, the pandemic coming back again. And I think all of that is -- would make it quite difficult to trade these assets if we needed to do so in some kind of quick haphazard fashion. And of course we don't need to do that. John Pawlowski : Sure. Okay. And then just trying to understand your comments on the recovery is a matter of when and not if. You're very still bullish on the knowledge based economies and you are in the past cycles opportunistic. I guess, why haven't you acted on the dislocation in your stock yet? I know there's illiquidity in some of your urban markets in terms of selling assets. It just feels like there's a big dislocation in front of you and I'm just curious why you're not selling more assets to buy back stock? Mark Parrell : Yes. I think there's two things going on in there and one is a capital allocation thought process that you laid out and there's also in our minds a risk management thought process. I mean, when we start selling assets to buy stock, which we can do that. We don't have that much tax pressure though. At some point, we would and we can't sell an unlimited number of assets and not have gain issues. But as you go through that process of taking EBITDA out of your company, taking NOI out of the company, you're increasing risk. 23% of our NOI right now is under significant pressure. So switching to a risk management thought process from our perspective, it seems better at this point to be a little more cautious to acknowledge the uncertainty that's out there in the world whether it relates to the pandemic or the values in some of these urban markets and just sit tight and operate the portfolio hard and that's a more prudent thing to do than to go and purchase shares. Because again once that capital leaves the firm, it can't come back.  So again for us just this recycling activity we'll keep doing John because again, it's just relatively minor and we're an apartment company. That's what we do, but buying stock back to us increases risk in the firm and we just think this isn't a point in time when you want to do that. John Pawlowski : All right. So there's no big large disposition plan coming? Mark Parrell : There are other assets that are going to be sold. We're going to sell into this bid as I mentioned for the value bid for some of this Class B renovation stuff in the suburbs. We've got properties where we don't believe in the renovation play where others may. So you should expect we'll sell into that. We may pay down some more debt. That will leave us with options, which could include a buyback at some juncture.  It will definitely include recycling into assets in these dense suburban areas and in other markets, which we've talked about on prior calls. So -- but doing a buyback right now with the pressure we're feeling on operations any uncertainty in the world at large does not seem like the right idea to us. John Pawlowski : All right. Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : We'll move on to Rich Hightower with Evercore. Rich Hightower : Hi. Morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Mark, I can't believe you don't want to run EQR like a hedge fund? Mark Parrell : It's always easier to look at these problems from the outside. Rich Hightower : Yes. No, it certainly, it's the numbers on a spreadsheet for the rest of us, right? You guys are in a real business. But I do want to hit on the current concession environment. Michael, I know that you mentioned four to six weeks being the norm in. I think Boston was the market mentioned. But help us understand, where are we two months, where are we three months three or some of the more sort of extreme numbers in that conversation?  And then maybe a quick follow-on to that. If we fast forward a year from now and we've got all these people all this sort of induced demand as you described due to much lower rents and more affordability, more concessions and that sort of thing. What happens at the end of the lease term, what's your historical experience there when there is a bit of sticker shock 12 months out? How should we expect that to factor into occupancy and turnover a year from now? So I know it's kind of a compound question, but appreciate any color. Michael Manelis : Yes. So first, let me just start. I'll just give you a little bit of color on the use of concessions today. So the markets that you would expect to have the most concession use, like I said 70% of all the concessions in the quarter were in those urban cores of the New York, Boston and San Francisco. New York about 70% of all of our applications are receiving a concession just about two months right now.  San Francisco the entire market overall, it's about 50% to 60% that are receiving a concession. And we're averaging right around that 1.5 months or six weeks. But if you go to the downtown San Francisco, you're closer to about 70% to 75% of all the applications receiving two months. Everywhere else is sitting kind of right at that six week or right around that one month mark. And I think what you should expect to see as I said in the prepared remarks, as we see some stability in occupancy see this improvement in demand or demand just holding steady, we'll start dialing back some of the concessions as we work our way through the year.  As far as coming upon the renewal side of the equation a year from now, when we underwrite applicants today, we underwrite them at their gross rent regardless of the concession. So our rent as a percent of income really has not changed in the portfolio from the applications. So we're still running between the low 17% in Seattle and the high at 22.5% in San Diego. And you look at those ratios and you would say they are going to be in a position to afford an increase. They're clearly going to be in a position to afford, continuing to write the check at the rent that the writing regardless of the concession they receive when they moved in with us. So I think that's how we're thinking about a year from now. Rich Hightower : Okay. That is helpful. And then just based on your historical experience with this sort of thing if we go back to '09, I mean is that pretty much the way it's played out back then where you underwrite a certain income rent ratio and upon renewal the tenants just sort of take it if the market is stronger. I mean, is that a pretty predictable renewal curve, or do you think there's some variability just kind of get in the unique nature of what's going on right now? Michael Manelis : Well, I think the extent of concession use is greater right now in the portfolio than it's ever been. So I don't know if we can look to the past down cycles and see what does that look like. I'll tell you a lot is going to depend on what the pace of the recovery is like. What do the cities feel like? What are these long-term work-from-home policies going to look like? That is going to dictate more around our concessions still being used widely in the marketplace.  If they are, we probably are not going to be able to just wipe off any concession on a year-over-year basis. We'll stair-step them back to the rents they're paying, but it's not like they're just going to go away. So a lot's going to depend about what is happening around us in that competitive market set as to how those renewals will be treated through our renewal negotiation process. Rich Hightower : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : From Morgan Stanley, we'll hear next from Rich Hill. Rich Hill : Hey, good morning, guys. I wanted to maybe just take a step back. I think what a lot of us are trying to get our arms around is when the headwinds begin to inflect. And so from your perspective, as you think about the drivers of rent growth in your markets, is it really a job growth inflection? Is it getting people back to markets like New York City that moved away because of COVID-19? Is it just rents resetting to a lower level? Can you just walk me through like what do you think from a macro standpoint are the biggest drivers of an inflection in rent growth? Mark Parrell : Hey, Rich, it's Mark. Thanks for that question. I guess as we think about it it's pretty predominantly related to the public health emergency. So let's spend a moment together speculating on how that might play out and that's all this is, meaning there is good reason to believe the virus will get worse. I think there's good reason to believe the vaccine will become available, especially the health workers and people that are more at risk over the next few months. And then slowly all the rest of us will get that. So you will head into the spring leasing season maybe with some positive signs on the COVID front. I mean one of the reasons you're hearing a lot of caution from us is we've got this elevated demand, which we like. We've got elevated inventory but we're also heading into the quietest time of the year. So we need to be really thoughtful about our seasonality. So not only are we fighting COVID, we're fighting seasonality. Right now we're bucking the seasonality. We're doing really well on leasing. The team's doing a great job. Rate's still suffering but what we would hope would happen just as you think about headwinds to us the most predominant headwind is COVID. Because on job growth, our resident base from what we can tell didn't lose their jobs. That was \u2013 unfortunately, people in some of these service sectors, in hospitality business, things like that and that is in our resident base. So I think a lot of our residents are well employed. They just don't care to live in some of these urban centers right now when their \u2013 these centers are disengaged and aren't as much fun to live in. And I think that a great number of those folks will come back. And the new crop of people the people that graduated from MBA programs, from technology programs and want that city experience, those folks will still want it, because that younger demographic that we mostly cater to balances safety I think and engagement entertainment differently. And I think Rich, they'll be \u2013 they'll want to come back and they'll be eager to come back if the cities are a reasonable facsimile of what they were before. So that's how we're looking at it. It doesn't mean, we're guaranteeing things are better in the spring but we're saying that the next quarter or so, we're dealing with the seasonal decline in demand as well as whatever the virus brings us. And that makes us a little more concerned. Rich Hill : I think that makes a lot of sense. To summarize it sounds like a good old-fashioned supply versus demand technical. And as demand begins to increase as people move back, hopefully that will lead to an inflection. Is that a correct characterization? Mark Parrell : Sure. And the comment in the press release that I made about things rolling through the financials I just want to make sure everyone understands, it isn't necessarily that things will keep getting worse and worse and worse. It's more that whatever is happening in the rent roll now, takes a quarter or so to manifest itself in reported numbers. So what will happen first is on some call in the future in some press release, Michael Manelis will tell you things have started to get better. Occupancy is firmed up. Concessions are declining. Maybe rate isn't moving yet but that famed second derivative is going in the right direction. So you'll see it in what I call the management accounting numbers before you see it in the numbers that Bob reports to you for same store revenues. So that's what we're trying. Because again we've got a pretty new group of analysts frankly on these calls. A lot of investors aren't as familiar. It's been a while since we've had a downturn. So we're just trying to make sure everyone understands how that works in the apartment business. Rich Hill : Yes. That's very clear. Thank you for that. Just a strategic question. And maybe it goes back to one of the earlier questions and I do very much appreciate your commentary about why you don't want to buy back stock. I think that's generally not the right thing to do in markets like this. But your stock is trading at a pretty meaningful discount to private market valuations, particularly against the backdrop of low global yields. There's a lot of money on the sidelines to invest in commercial real estate. Private equity seems to be making a big push in the commercial real estate, particularly for stable cash flow assets with strong secular tailwinds. And that all sort of regulates at least back to us to the apartment sector. So I guess my question in a very long way is, is there a scenario valuations were to stay here for another six to 12 months, where you would seriously consider either a significant JV with a private company or maybe just say \"Hey look. You know what? The best thing for our shareholders is to take ourselves private.\" I recognize that's a big check and there's a lot of friction costs and I'm curious how you think about that. Mark Parrell : Well, there's one thing you said I want to latch on to. You said the interest of PE firms. And generally, the private folks with investment dollars are very interested in the apartment sector. And you use the word stable. I would say half our business is pretty stable. A third of it in the urban centers outside New York, Boston, San Francisco is okay, but marginally weakening and then a quarter of our business is having a tough run of it. So I'd say that when you think about the buyback, like I said in some of the prior responses and when you think about any other action or interest from PE firms, there's going to be a lot of interest in the New York portfolio at the moment. That portfolio needs to find a floor on rents. It needs to have some enthusiasm and excitement in the urban center again and people moving back in. Then you'll get a floor under that. In terms of taking a company this size private I mean that's obviously a matter for the Board to consider, not for me alone to determine, but I think it's way too early to start thinking about things like that. And I would expect that at some point again when the operations of the company, especially in the urban centers feel a little more stable, we'll feel like a larger menu of capital allocation options are open to us. At that point, there'll be conversations with the Board about things like buybacks again, and other conversations. For now, I think the best thing to do is to run the portfolio hard and stay super flexible. And that's the right thing to do. Rich Hill : All right, guy. Thank you that. Keep up the good fight. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : From Bank of America, we'll hear from Jeff Spector. Jeff Spector : Great. Good morning. Mark Parrell : Good morning. Jeff Spector : First question, -- hi, on markets. I appreciate, your comments on knowledge-based economies and your positioning in these different cities. Just to confirm, are you saying that you and your team you're not more concerned today about any of the markets you're in for example San Fran downtown or Seattle downtown and that you're happy with your positioning? Michael Manelis : What I'd say about our positioning is the COVID virus the whole pandemic has just accelerated a bunch of trends. And among those is just the dispersion of high wage job growth outside the coastal centers where they used to be predominant, okay? So we have talked about adding exposure in Denver. We've talked about potentially going into Austin. There's other markets that at the right time we'll talk about with you as well. So I think you can expect that we will spread our capital around a bit more over time because I think those jobs have moved around for a lot of different reasons Jeff. I think some people just want different lifestyle. Some folks are looking to get away from maybe some, sort of, tax or political thing that they're concerned about. But I would say for the most part, our residents when you look at where affluent we think renters and the knowledge industries are -- San Francisco still has a lot of advantages as a technology center. New York still has a lot of advantages as both the technology and financial services center. Boston and the biotech in Cambridge and biotech and financial services. So -- but there are other markets that are of interest. So I would say in terms of our positioning right now I'd tell you I think we will continue as we've said I think since 2018 to add exposure in dense suburban areas where we can find affluent renters. And we'll follow our affluent renters to places like Austin and to Denver and we'll continue doing that. So you should expect that we'll continue to broaden the platform out and continue to react to that and react to things like political risk in some of our markets. But there's no risk-free apartment market. Some of the markets that you might move into have had in the past very significant supply issues don't have as big a base of high wage apartment renters. So there's -- again there's a balancing act as you enter each of these markets. Jeff Spector : Thank you. Michael Manelis : Thank you. Jeff Spector : And my follow-up question is on New York City given that is one of the weaker markets. And I believe in the earlier remarks you talked about a lot of those renters leaving for New Jersey. I live in New Jersey and I could say, I don't think many young people want to live in New Jersey. So I take that maybe as a positive. I mean when you do your exit interviews are these 20 to 30 year-olds moving back home with the parents temporarily? Like I'm just -- I know you don't know, but if there is a vaccine and this -- that could be a nice boost to the spring/summer leasing season for 2021? Michael Manelis : Yes. So, I guess, I'll give you just a little bit of color on -- I think, I said in the prepared remarks we're definitely seeing an increase in those that are leaving the market. So we used to have about 70% -- or used to be 50%. Now it's about 70%. And New Jersey, Connecticut and California are the top three states where those that do leave are going to with suburban New Jersey is where the majority of them were going. The -- anecdotally from our doorman, from the concierge in the building are -- regardless of the demographic, whether it's young and going back with mom and dad, whether it's the older a lot of them basically are telling the doorman, telling the concierge they will be back. And they will be back as soon as we get to the other side of this pandemic. So to us that's the positive sign that we have that the renter base that we had will return. It's just a matter of when they're going to return. Jeff Spector : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll hear next from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Anthony Paolone : Yeah. Thanks. Just two, I think, bigger ones. One is just to understand in California, if you're offering a resident-free rent and then next year, they renew does that -- is that impacted by the CPI plus 5% regulation, or does that only affect the face rental? Like how does that work? Michael Manelis : I'm not sure, we have that answer for you right at the top of our fingertips. I mean, CPI is often driven by housing in some of these places. So that is going to be approaching an 8% number under the California rules, which is a one-month concession at least. So I guess I don't -- we don't know the answer to that off the top of our heads. Anthony Paolone : All right. And something like San Francisco where you give someone two months of free rent when that -- if they renew does that rule kind of inhibit the ability to take those two, three months out? Michael Manelis : I don't believe so. I think concessions are going to be excluded from that calculation and if you held somebody's rent flat or you actually raised their rent up. But again I'm not 100% positive of that. Anthony Paolone : Okay. And then just second one, just given the hits and rents in the portfolio how long do you think it takes, or what are the prospects to maybe do something on the property tax side? Mark Parrell : Yes. So, I think, it's going it's a little bit of a laggard, right? So -- on the property tax side. So right now, we're kind of beginning or prepping for the -- I'll call it hand-to-hand combat or conversations with every local jurisdiction, but it tends to run kind of on a lagging basis. You probably won't see anything or any kind of relief at least until 2021 or maybe even into 2022 based on prior experience. It's going to be that argument or that conversation about what jurisdictions are doing on the rate side relative to what they're doing on the assessment side. We're very used to this. We've done it for years and we will have those conversations. So far we haven't seen much activity, but it's really just the nature of when -- when the actual assessments or new rates and all that comes out depending on the jurisdiction. Anthony Paolone : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll hear next from Rich Anderson with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. Rich Anderson : Very good. Good morning. So, it sounds like from a geographical pie chart, you kind of have some ideas about what the company might look like in the aftermath of all this down the road. But I'm wondering if anything that has happened operationally has opened your eyes to processes within the organization whether its tenant select -- resident selection credit process that maybe is -- could be sort of a cleansing event, I hate to put it that way, for the future of Equity Residential. Do you see any changes in how you run things as a result of what you've seen through all of this? Michael Manelis : Well, I think, early on and we talked about this on the last quarter, we saw that the exposure from corporate providers, right, we didn't have a lot to begin with. It was like at 1.5% of the portfolio. We're now down 50%. So we have fewer than 600 units right now with corporate providers. So, I think, one of the early lessons I learned is, yes, we'll probably keep that at a pretty low number throughout the portfolio. I don't think we'll bounce right back. Or if we do, we're going to have really large security deposits on hand from those kind of folks. Operationally, other than that, I think, the biggest thing that this did is, it created a catalyst for us on our sales process. And it has shown us how fast we can move to virtual leasing and how fast we can move to self-guided kind of tours and still be able to produce pretty strong application count. So I think operationally you're seeing us adjust that way to shape the business on the sales side. And we're getting ready to deploy kind of our new sales application this next month that's going to bring mobility to the sales teams and allow us to kind of have multiple assets covered by individuals. So, I think, those are probably the biggest takeaways that I've had on the learnings of these. Rich Anderson : Okay, great. And the second question, maybe for Mark, and I don't know if we -- the best analogy might be back to 9/11 in New York. And I -- unfortunately, I wasn't there covering you back then too. And everyone said \"I'm never coming back to New York.\" Do you have a recollection of how quickly the bounce-back happened and if there's anything about that period of time that can be fast forwarded today? Because they both kind of share a similar sort of fear element to it. And I'm wondering, if that is guiding you at any way, shape or form in terms of how things might progress when we do kind of get a vaccine or some sort of therapy in place. Mark Parrell : Yes. It's a little anecdotal for us, because though we've owned for a while in New York, we really didn't own right then. So what we know about what happened then is mostly from, frankly, our people who did work at other apartment companies or all our contacts that lived in the market. I mean, again, New York, you said it very well. The difference in population is significant. I mean, by 2016, the city was considerably more populated. And I think it might have had the highest population it ever had compared to 2001. And the obituary was clearly written on New York then. The city, Michael and I would summarize it from being there and from our conversations, talking -- New York is definitely trying to get up off the mat. If some progress can continue to hold on the virus, people want to go back. There's a special feeling to the city. People are there. There's a lot of interest. Our volume in New York is higher proportionately than anywhere else. It's just the rate is low. We just need even more demand to make up for folks that have made the decision, Rich, to move temporarily to New Jersey or whatnot and come back. So I'm probably a little less concerned with New York than I am with San Francisco, where a combination of work from home and just quality-of-life concerns and just the sort of general feeling around that -- those 10 properties we have in the city of San Francisco, that feels probably a little more concerning to me in the medium term. I think, again, as long as the pandemic by the spring starts to wane and we have it under control, I think, people want to be back in New York. And that will happen. In San Francisco, I just think it might take longer frankly. Rich Anderson : Yes. Okay, great. Thanks Mark. Thanks, everyone. Mark Parrell : Hey, thanks, Rich. Operator : We'll hear now from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Hi. Good morning. Mark and Michael, you mentioned that safety, social unrest and the lack of social engagement activities are impacting apartment demand. And unfortunately these have been very politicized issues in many core cities. I was wondering, if you are working with any political or business organizations to encourage the reopening of offices or restaurants or other businesses? Mark Parrell : So we have significant engagement through our trade associations on all sorts of things. I don't recall being specifically engages related to reopening restaurants. We're certainly big supporters of the idea that the partnership for New York put out in their letter of getting the cities running again and being on top of everything from sanitation to just all the transit all the things that make cities fun and livable. So, I guess, our answer to that is, we're not involved day-to-day in that, but the trade associations we support are involved in those things. And we support the bigger groups of citizens and leaders and companies that are pushing for being a little more balanced here and for political leaders to take into account these business interests. John Kim : You mentioned on prior calls that moved out to buy a home was around 12% and I'm wondering if that's changed at all with the homeownership rate spiking up to 67% earlier this year. Michael Manelis : Yes, it actually ticked down this quarter. So we're just below 11%. We saw like a nominal pickup in the Southern California markets around Orange County and San Diego. But other than that, every market has basically declined about 1 point. John Kim : And my final question is on the bad debt expense. What percentage of that 2% does that represent as far as uncollected rent? Mark Parrell : The majority of it -- I guess, the majority of the 2% growth, really, all of it is uncollected rent. I mean, whether that's your monthly rent or your utility reimbursement, whatever the charge is to the resident, that's the uncollected amount that's in there. John Kim : I missed to ask the question, I'm sorry. What percentage of the uncollected rent -- sorry what percent of bad debt expense is -- what percentage of the uncollected rent relating to that represents? Michael Manelis : So John, do you mean on -- you're breaking up a little. Do you mean rent versus say utility charges or fees, or I'm not sure we follow the question. John Kim : I'll take this off-line. I'm sorry. Michael Manelis : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And from Janney, we'll move to Rob Stevenson. Rob Stevenson : Good morning guys. Just a question on the bad debt there. Mark, you said earlier your tenants weren't losing their jobs. What were the key factors in driving the bad debt higher? For some of the others, it was the elimination of the federal unemployment subsidy. But if you didn't have the unemployment what's been driving that? And is that still accelerating, or are you stabilizing at this point? Bob Garechana : So I'd say that it's geographically focused, right? So some -- the bad debt is running higher in places like Los Angeles, which was before the pandemic, the area where you probably had the highest or the most constrained kind of rent to income levels. So you may have had probably centers or pockets, where you had a little bit more gig economy stuff. So some people have lost their jobs. We're talking about a pretty small population base in the aggregate of call it 1,100 folks that are in that bad debt piece anyways. So it's -- there is some job loss, right, but for the most part to Mark's earlier point, we think our general demographic isn't really driving it. And I'll tell you, it's been really consistent and hasn't changed much. Mark said in his prepared remarks, we had this pocket of how our policy works. But if you look at individual accounts like you've had the same accounts, they hit the 3x. They kind of peaked in July. And since then, we haven't really added very much at all to that non-payer bucket. It's actually the same kind of existing group that has just continued not to pay that is there at 9/30. Mark Parrell : Yes. And I just would add, I mean there's some percentage of our residents who did lose their jobs, did have situations like Bob mentioned. They could be gig workers in the content industry in L.A. There's also public policy reasons. Some people aren't paying, because they feel like they don't have to. And we continue to pursue those folks. And within the bounds of the law, we'll be relentless in that matter. I mean, there's a contractual obligation here, but we also want to work with people. I mean, if there's some understanding that they need from us, they need some more time, we've got a good number of payment plans out there. So you made your comment. I think you're right. There's some folks where that government supplement mattered. That didn't matter as much to us, but there was a few employees -- or a few people excuse me residents of ours that did lose their jobs and that's certainly in the number that we wrote off in the quarter. But there is some of that that's likely behavior-driven and that's something that will work itself out over the next whatever number of quarters. Rob Stevenson : Okay. And then, how are you guys feeling about the California vote next week? And is there any of this type of legislature or ballot initiatives in other markets that haven't got as much attention that you guys are worried about? Bob Garechana : Sure. So we remain reasonably confident on defeating Prop 21. I think the industry is well organized. Barry Altshuler, who's one of our senior investment guys is the President of the California Apartment Association with other industry leaders. He's just led a really great campaign to educate people in California. That Prop 21 doesn't create a single unit new unit of affordable housing. It doesn't put anyone who's homeless into a home. All it does is discourage investment in our markets in housing. So I think what we feel as we've made a good case. Things have changed in terms of the way the vote will be tabulated. I mean it's all remote. It wouldn't surprise us if it continued past the actual election day as maybe more than one election will in the U.S., but we feel pretty good about it. There was a good poll in one of the Southern California papers on this as well. So at this moment, we're feeling reasonably confident, but it's a presidential election year. A lot more people will be voting than voted in 2018 and we'll keep making our case to the people in the state of California all the way through November 3. Rob Stevenson : Okay. Bob Garechana : And in terms of vote places, yes there's not a lot. There's a ballot measure in Colorado that would raise property taxes for residential both homeownership and apartment owners and stuff like that, but it's just not nearly as significant as Prop 21. So that's where for us at least most of the action is. Rob Stevenson : And anything working its way through the legislature in New York or Massachusetts or elsewhere in California? Bob Garechana : Sure. Well we'll do a quick survey. So Washington state, they're obviously they're going to have their legislative election. There's been some discussion there about California-tyle rent control, meaning a CPI plus and inclusive of vacancy decontrol. The industry continues to talk about that with them. There's some real downsides to part of that approach, but we're engaging in that conversation. As you go across a little less pressure in Massachusetts, certainly New York has its own set of elections in a week and we'll see what that ends up being. But I would imagine there's always things to talk about in New York, but there isn't anything on the hopper. And as I understand, it the general assembly isn't in session. So we don't need to worry about that at the moment. Washington D.C. city council is considering various rent control measures, a few of which are highly negative. We don't think those are likely to go through. We're having constructive conversations there through our trade association. So there's always things that we're looking into Rob and we're always out there supporting. And we have a pretty active engagement with policymakers and when it's a ballot proposal with the whole electorate on this stuff. And usually, once you have the conversations, you and explain what's really going to happen here the emotional satisfaction of rent control, usually fades away because it doesn't work. I mean universally academics tell you it doesn't work and the market experience shows it doesn't work. And we try and talk about ways to improve zoning, to create private incentives, so that people are out there building more affordable. So that's really the battle. Rob Stevenson : Okay. Thanks guys. Appreciate it. Bob Garechana : Thank you. Operator : We'll hear now from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Haendel St. Juste: Hey. Good afternoon here, good morning to you. Hey, Mark. So I guess first question. Just curious on your views on the extension of eviction moratoriums here in California and New York recently. I guess I'm curious, how much of a risk you think that poses indirectly and directly to apartment of portfolios and your portfolios in those markets? Mark Parrell : So we're fortunate with these eviction moratoriums instead high-quality resident base where again our people are getting great service. I mean, I read all these comments Haendel and it's really awesome that we get from the people that work for Michael and on site. And it's folks that interact with our service personnel, our customers, our residents, interact with our concierge, with our on-site staff. And they say, terrific things. So a lot of our people they don't hate their landlord. They like their experience with us. They think we're doing a good job. They appreciate how hard we work during the pandemic to keep them safe. So the good news for us is, most of our residents pay and that's not a problem. In terms of these eviction moratorium which have been tough on a lot of more affordable landlords I think the right answer is, what the industry has been pushing National Multi Housing Council and others which is the proposal, the idea of putting more cash in the pockets of renters so they can pay their rent. The idea of putting this loss entirely on landlords and breaking the residential housing system in the United States is just a terrible idea in the long run. And I think the answer is, if the need is great then we as taxpayers have to shoulder that burden. Congress needs to appropriate the money. President needs to sign the law and the money needs to go either directly to landlords or to residents who are in need so they can make their payments. So landlords in turn -- I mean EQR for example our biggest single expense is $400 million a year in property taxes. That in turn support all the first responders, in these hard-pressed municipalities and stuff and as well as our significant payroll costs and keeping our properties up. So I guess Haendel, it's about having that conversation with people and explaining the whole, I've heard it called connected ecosystem here. I mean so -- but again for EQR it hasn't been quite as big an issue yet, but I think in the long run these eviction moratoriums are pretty awful idea. And I think they become less and less justifiable as time goes on. Haendel St. Juste: I appreciate the thoughts there. Second question and I'm not going on New York City, but from a different perspective and I guess you have to have a little bit of patience here understanding the number of questions on New York City already, but I wanted to go back. And really the question that I asked you last quarter when we discussed well, I asked you when you thought New York could return to positive same-store NOI territory. I think at that point in July we and many investors were expecting NOI to sort of like continue to decline into early next year with the trough in New York City not occurring until spring and maybe middle of next year and a positive return potentially by the second half of 2022. Now since that July call obviously operating conditions have clearly remained and probably gotten a bit more challenging with concessions even more prevalent here. So I guess in my mind, is it fair to assume or expect that timeline to that potentially positive same-store NOI now shifting to now 2023, even if we get a vaccine and the pandemic starts to wane next spring, just given the level of concessions now being offered how deep into the year and basically the size of the hole you're not climbing out from here? Mark Parrell : Wow. A lot in that question. I'm hesitant to give you guidance. I mean we don't have any formal guidance. And I'm hesitant to suggest any particular quarter for things changing on the NOI front. It doesn't mean that we have pessimism. It's just impossible with the public health emergency to predict. But I will tease this color out. Again on the rate side it, takes a while for it to go negative and a while for it to go positive. And that's what we've been talking about. The little offhand comment we made was on occupancy. Right now we have buildings that are occupied in the high 80s that are very desirable buildings. And when New York becomes New York again and people move back, that improvement in occupancy will be immediate. And that will go to the top line immediately and to the NOI number you referred to. So rate takes a while both up and down. This was quick because there was so much pressure. On the way up, you should expect it will take a while on rates to get rid of the concessions start moving rate. That will take a little while, but the occupancy boost will feel more immediate. And unfortunately I mean this portfolio was running 97%. Right now this morning we're 89.9%. So right at 90% as Michael said. You could make up 7 points in occupancy, if the city became the city again pretty quick. And again, I'm not predicting when that occurs, but I think there's an occupancy opportunity for us but which quarter it all occurs just depends on when the virus gets better. Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. And last one if you'll indulge me the obligatory political elections question on what perhaps the implications of a potential Biden victory would mean for coastal little bit of markets like New York, San Francisco Boston and the CBD portfolios there. And how would you view the odds of perhaps potential direct stimulus after some of these markets and maybe balance that against perhaps a rollback in some of the mortgage tax deduction ceilings that we put in place during the Trump tax cut? So just at a high level just curious on your views on what a potential Biden victory would mean and perhaps some of the policy initiatives that could play out and what that means for your portfolio? Thanks. Bob Garechana : Yes. So because that also depends on who controls the Senate and whether the House stays where it is now and -- but it's really hard to speculate on. I mean I think it's pretty well understood the programs people have. I mean some of the things you didn't mention for example, more certainty on immigration and more positive immigration policies would be helpful to us. More regulation would generally not be positive for us. Some things like taxes changing may create more or less economic growth. So it's hard for me to say that, EQR is a particular dog in this fight and I'm hesitant to get involved in any of that. So -- but I do think the mortgage tax thing it wasn't a big impact on us before when they took it away, so I doubt it will matter very much here to us at all. I think a stimulus package to me, I think after the election's done, I would guess there's a pretty high chance that that will get done because once the election's done given how frail the stock market and the economy feel, I think the politicians will look at each other and go, okay we need to do this now and there's not as much risk to the election is over and there's no benefit to be gained from waiting. So I guess, I'm sort of expecting some stimulus to happen after the election. That seems like the bedding line out there regardless of who wins. Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Thank you for your time and I will look forward. Thank you. Bob Garechana : Thank you. Operator : And we'll move on to Alexander Kalmus with Zelman & Associates. Alexander Kalmus : Hi, thank you for taking my question. Digging into the applications, what does the credit quality look like versus history? And how does the conversion process from application to lease compare, are you seeing a rent price bid-ask spreads of any kind? Michael Manelis : So, I think I said earlier, we do not change our underwriting criteria at all. So, applicants coming in are run and screened against the growth rent, regardless of concessions. And we really didn't see a material shift in the affordability index, which is rent as a percent of income across any of our markets, where we range still between that 17% and 23%. As far as -- can you give me the last part of that question? Bob Garechana : Just a credit quality question. Alexander Kalmus : Yes. If there's a spread between a rent, maybe the price that they're throwing out for a unit that is maybe a low-ball offer. Or are you seeing more of that versus real legitimate prospects? Michael Manelis : No. I mean this is legitimate prospects. I think one of the parts of the question I forgot, which was the closing ratio. So the way to think about kind of, typically you would have foot traffic those that come in for the virtual tour or a self-guided tour, about 25% of the time that converts into an application. And that closing ratio has been fairly consistent. We had a little bit of a change when we got into the initial COVID period, but right now it's fairly stable in our ability to convert kind of that traffic to applications. But really not seeing anything from a quality of the renter or the quality of the applicant showing up for these units. Mark Parrell : And I want to add, Alex. People, who are applying for us, are putting down a deposit and paying a fee. So when they're involved with us, it isn't -- you make it sound like it's a little bit of a bid. I mean at that point, we've sort of agreed on price with them, subject to a credit and criminal background check review. And they move -- the great preponderance of those people end up moving in with us. So applications for us, just so you understand, are a forward indicator of move-ins. This month's applications are next month's move-ins, and are -- that month's reduction in left to lease and that next month's increase in occupancy. Maybe that helps you. So the quality -- and we do qualify people based on the rent without the concession, just to be really clear about that. So they can afford to pay the face rent, not just the rent, reduced on some effective basis by the concession. Alexander Kalmus : Got it. Appreciate the color there. And then, so looking at a little different question here. The performance of nonresidential real estate asset touches overall, even underperformed, a lot of the residential sector that we see. Are you hearing of any conversions from hotels or offices or even retail into new apartment buildings in urban centers? Mark Parrell : Yeah, there were some -- it's Mark. There were some discussion Alex, we've heard from our people in Southern California, both hospitality plays, strip centers in the Los Angeles area strip retail, of which there's a fair amount that might go residential. So there is some conversation, and I've heard about it, particularly in Southern California as to both hospitality and retail. There's other spots we've been involved with shopping center owners, and thinking about repurposing out lots and things like that. So there's a fair bit of conversation on that. But, again most recently, I've heard a fair bit about it in Southern Cal. Alexander Kalmus : Got it. Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : Thanks. So, just a question on your urban core, it's helpful you guys break out the occupancy now. Do you have any stats on -- if we look at the drop in occupancy that was very visible in the urban core? How much of those renters stayed in the market versus left the urban core. Do you have any sense on that? Michael Manelis : Yeah. Well, I think I shared a little bit of that before, like in New York that we saw an increase of those leaving. So both, New York and San Francisco, probably saw the most pronounced increases of those leaving that MSA but staying nearby, moving to kind of other nearby market, that may have more concentration of suburban-type properties in there. Nick Yulico : Okay. But you don't have any specific stats you can share about -- because you've obviously framed this as an issue where occupancy is a problem, because people are leaving the urban core. They may come back, but how are you sure that you're not just losing out to other properties? And I guess I'm wondering whether you guys feel like you are competitive right now with your concessions or if there's some elements of this occupancy drop that's happening in the urban core are residents, who are going to the developer down the road is just getting an even bigger concession package. Michael Manelis : Yeah. So, I guess, I would say -- I think I've said it a couple of times now. In those urban cores, you're absolutely seeing people leave those downtown areas and go to other nearby markets with some upticks like in New York that actually leave the state entirely. So, as you think about the moves intra-city, so are we losing residents that then go to competitors in the market? I guess I will tell you that our renewal process is set up in such a way to handle those negotiations, not only on site but then as soon as somebody does give us a notice, we leverage our national call center to place calls to those residents, just to make sure there is nothing we can do within reason to keep them. And for the most part this is not a rate play. So, I'm sure there are a few that leave us and go somewhere to some concession offer that is just outside of the market boundaries, but a very small percentage of those residents that leave us are doing that to us. The other way to think about it is the increased volume of applications that we're seeing right now, is a pretty good indicator from a market competitive standpoint of our pricing. If we were not competitive, we would not be seeing new leases coming to us. Nick Yulico : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : We'll hear now from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you. Thank you, and good morning out there. So. two questions. The first one, one of the -- one of my peers asked earlier about the ability to reassess on the property tax given the drop in NOIs, but obviously that takes time. You guys have been very efficient on OpEx and on the G&A front, but still as you look at the rent declines, do you see an ability to offset some of that on the expense or G&A side, or you guys have gotten yourself so lean and then also on the capital markets side refinanced so much debt that there's really not much additional that you can do from either a cost or interest expense side? Mark Parrell : Hey, Alex, it's Mark. We're going to split that up. I'm going to ask Bob to talk about capital markets and the debt maturity, we got coming next year that's at pretty high rate. He can go through in a second. On our end, you're going to see that in the quarter at least G&A and property management, our overhead categories collectively were down, I think, it was 10% or 15%. You should expect that to continue. I mean, we're certainly responsive to the fact that cash flow's going down and overhead needs to follow that. So, there'll continue to be adjustments in that regard. I don't feel like we have a lot of folks that aren't being well utilized. I think it's just a matter of what is going to be sort of bonus compensation, those sorts of things. That's where the discussions lie. And then just running the business more efficiently, Michael talked earlier about he did in terms of remote leasing. That certainly has impacts on headcount. So things like that. So you should expect that we will be just as relentless. I'm not -- again, I don't feel like we have a lot of people sitting around on their hands, but I do think we need to be responsive to the fact that NOIs are going down and overhead needs to respond to that. And you can see in the third quarter, it did and you should expect it will continue to. Bob Garechana : And on the balance sheet side, Alex as you think about it, you've got the big maturity the $750 million maturity in 2021. That does carry a 4.625% coupon, and we could refinance that today on a 10-year basis at call it 2%. So there is still a positive arbitrage between the refinancing activity going forward. So that exists frankly if you look at our maturity schedule on Page 2018 not just in 2021, but continue in 2022 based on where -- and 2023, despite the fact that we don't have a ton of debt maturing. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second question is going back on Haendel's question. Mark, as you look at the markets over time, there's definitely been a shift in the past certainly two decades, more rent control or more rent control used in markets the eviction moratoriums, I mean, there's a lot more housing regulation in coastal markets that we didn't previously have. Additionally, they're talking in progressive ways about rent moratoriums or rent write-offs or national rent regulations, et cetera, if the demo suite. So, certainly, there's a lot there. How do you think about just overall when you guys originally looked at your current portfolio and all the factors that drove you to these markets versus the political changes that have happened now and maybe also price point changes, where maybe you get a more lower -- more of a broader mix, et cetera. So if you look at the overall EQR portfolio now, do you feel that the original trends that you saw that got you into these markets are still there, or you would say, hey guys, there's some things that have shifted on the political and on the affordability side that we should reassess. And maybe while these markets will come back, because they're viable they're going to be different and maybe we want to be positioned more differently than just waiting for the markets to come back. Bob Garechana : Yeah, I don't think we're just going to wait for the markets to come back. I think political risk has changed in our markets. I think when we thought about this shift into urban 15 years ago. One of the reasons we liked the urban centers was it was politically difficult to build, that the politics created a supply constraint that we like. So to be honest some of the markets were chosen with some of that in mind, Alex. And then as time has gone on, I would say what's happened is that there's this bit of a bias against landlords. There's a bit of a regulatory mindset that is challenging to work through and we do think political risk is higher in our markets. And one of the reasons to spread our capital out both in the suburbs of our markets, because a lot of rent control and rent regulation is local, okay? Some of it is at the state level, but a lot of it is local. So you might want to be in a metro, but you may not be want to be exactly where you were in the center before. So you should expect we'll continue responding to that risk by spreading out and also going into some metros where the supply risk may actually be worse in some of those other metros we're not in, but you're getting some compensating political risk benefits. I'll also say that you didn't mention it quite as much, but the fiscal situation is quite concerning in some of our markets by the way also in some markets we're not in, okay? So, there's plenty of municipalities under a lot of stress. That's another thing we keep in mind. So, whenever we buy an asset, we underwrite or develop an asset. Two, we underwrite the locality, the county, the state and how it looks from a financial perspective and think about as a land -- long-term owner of this property whether that's a risk we're willing to take. So, I think we're pretty focused on managing our existing political risk by having like, again, this big outreach to politicians and to policymakers we talked about and then secondarily just over time shifting some of our capital to places that maybe are a little friendlier in that regard. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then just one final if I could. You guys mentioned on your California residents are very happy in renting. Are you -- are all of the tenants who are taking advantage of this optionality if they can -- to pay or not pay. Are all of those tenants now out? Have you let those people just leave with a minimal break fee, or do you still have a bunch of California residents who are sort of living rent-free? Mark Parrell : So, Alex, we believe in the sanctity of contract both ways. And so these people we don't have the ability to evict them. So, there are some number of people that can pay that haven't. We'll continue to monitor that situation. Again, we're always willing to -- some people haven't even communicated with us. We talked about ghosting on the last call and had a little fun with that, but we've got to have these conversations with people figure out how we can help them, how they can meet their contractual obligation to pay rent and how we can move forward. There is no rent forgiveness program at Equity Residential. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you, Mark. Mark Parrell : Thanks a lot, Alex. Operator : And from Baird, we'll move to Amanda Sweitzer. Amanda Sweitzer : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to follow-up on some of your election comments. You guys evaluated all the potential benefit to your portfolio integration reform? And then do you have any data on either what proportion of your residential are skilled immigrants or which of your markets may benefit the most for immigration reform. Michael Manelis : I think what I can give you is just a little bit of backdrop which is, last year this time about 7% in of our applications were coming from those residents outside of the United States. At present, we're down to about 2%, for the third quarter of 2020. So I think changes -- positive changes in the immigration policy that allow us to get back to where we were, would be a catalyst for some of the recoveries in some of those major markets where we're feeling more pressure right now. Amanda Morgan : That's helpful. And just the 7% of applications that you mentioned, were those concentrated in any particular markets, or was it pretty widely distributed? Michael Manelis : I guess, I would tell you that it's the major mar -- it is Boston, San Francisco and New York, that you see the biggest changes on this year-over-year basis. Amanda Morgan : Okay. That's helpful. That's it for me. Thanks. Michael Manelis : Thank you. Operator : We'll take a follow-up from Nick Joseph with Citi. Michael Bilerman : Hi. It's Michael Bilerman here for Nick. Just two quick questions, one, Mark you talked a little bit about, how taxes play into somewhat of your ability to sell substantial assets and do buybacks. One of the public apartment peers did a large joint venture and also doing a spin-off. Can you talk about whether either of those would work for EQR? And if not, why? Mark Parrell : Sure. So again, I don't understand all the back and forth on the tax side with our peer. But I would say that most joint venture transactions when you're keeping the cash. And you're the 40-plus percent seller, which does create gain, unless you do a lot of structuring things that create other risks. So doing a JV is great to prove value to create diversification to get new capital and all those other things. But in terms of it being a great way to sell an asset it isn't a whole lot different than just selling it out, right. So I guess I'd say on the tax side, I look at the JV and I look at an asset sale relatively similarly. Now if a JV partner, an institutional investor wanted to be in with us in a market. And they would provide a better price and better terms on the portion they were purchasing, because they are differently correlated than just the straight up buyers, we'd be interested in that we're open minded. We have very few JVs, but we've done many in the past. And so, I guess, I'd say, Michael, we're open to doing some JVs at some of our assets and maybe some of our urban assets if the price made sense to us. But it -- getting cash out and buying stock back just to use the most obvious example, is a pretty hard thing to do at least in great size, without triggering some kind of special dividend requirement or really stressing your tax situation. Michael Bilerman : And then specifically then on the second part on, spinning or doing something to effectuate on an increased tax basis, does that have any -- does that resonate at all with the Board or with you or it just does not makes sense? Mark Parrell : Every company has got its own goals and motives, but the way I've been taught for years is to not pay taxes earlier, than you need to. And so there isn't a great deal of desire on the part of our Board to create a taxable event, just so that the company has more flexibility in selling assets. So if we need that flexibility, we can manage that at the time. And we did do a special dividend before. And that's because giving capital back to the shareholders, in that case made so much sense. So I guess I'd rather address that on an as-needed basis, rather than do it in some parameter fashion. Michael Bilerman : Yeah. And then, just lastly just coming back on the application data and appreciate splitting up the portfolio and giving us the different pieces. I assume the increase in applications is also a matter of increased vacancy right? Because no one's going to apply for apartments that are fully leased, you've got to create vacant -- you have to have vacancy for more applications. And so you have 80,000 or so units. Almost 5,000 of them are vacant today. You talked about that 1,100 that are not paying their rent for more than three months. So do you have like at least the history on just numbers that go behind the percentages? And then, how those -- how coincident how lagging they may be just to sort of get the history of occupancy and applications over time, so that we can use these numbers as a potential leading indicator to occupancies moving up? Michael Manelis : Yeah. So I guess I'll kind of frame it. So at a total portfolio level, the applications in the third quarter were call it $12,700. And that's compared to $10,700 last year there's definitely seasonality components to those applications. So you will see applications that hit a peak in June or July, call it at 4,000 or 5,000 applications a month. They'll drop down to 2,000 a month or 2,400 a month in November and December. So I would look at this as just the indicator that we are seeing, an extended leasing season. Your point about available inventory is dead on. We need the applications to be running 120%. We actually needed them to be like 125%, in the third quarter just so that we could have held on to the occupancy that we had in the beginning. So A lot of this is just the trade out between if retention starts to improve, we start to renew more residents, then that takes a little bit of pressure off the front door. But if we're going to continue to renew residents call it at 50% 50% of that we will need applications running, 120%, 130%, over prior year. Bob Garechana : Yeah. That's a great point about we'll continue to try in our materials for NAREIT to continue to elaborate on that, because the virtuous cycle for us the beginning of improvement begins with retention improving and with applications holding. They don't have to go up from here and likely won't just given seasonally where we are, but continuing to outperform on applications which again a month later are move-ins and doing better on renewals especially in these urban markets. That will start solidifying occupancy. That will start giving Michael confidence to start removing concessions. So we absolutely will try and be as clear as we can about, historical trends. And you've been around a long time. So this gets confused with you've got this cycle win this economic cycle on top of just our seasonal cycle. So you have two things going on. We may tell you in December that, applications went down but they're still three times what they normally are in December, right? But they're less than November. So we'll try and do a good job of being clear on those things. Michael Bilerman : Okay. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it Bob. Bob Garechana : Thank you. Operator : Gentlemen, at this time, I'd like to turn things back to you for closing remarks. Mark Parrell : Well, we thank you for the interest in Equity Residential for sticking with us on a long call. And we wish everyone well. Thanks. Operator : And that will conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for attending. Everyone now has left the call.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Marty McKenna, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Marty McKenna : Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss Equity Residential\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2020 results and outlook for 2021. Our feature speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release as well as a management presentation regarding our results and outlook are posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. I want to start by thanking all 2,700 of my Equity Residential colleagues across the country for their dedication in serving our 150,000 residents during a very difficult year. Your commitment and hard work at the company through 2020 and I know you are ready to drive our recovery in 2021. Today, I will start with some color on the current state of our business and its future prospects, then Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide an operating update, and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide detail on our guidance expectations, and then we will take your questions. We also posted to our website at equityapartments.com a management presentation that provides some background on both current operations and our guidance expectations. Turning to the business, we are encouraged by the recovery in demand in all of our markets and especially, in our urban submarkets. In real estate, demand is the unsolvable problem. Without it no other economic factor matters and in our business, both urban and suburban, we see plenty of it. As noted in the presentation and release applications, net move in activity and occupancy have all turned upward, especially over the last 2 months. This positive trend, in spite of a worsening pandemic, and renewed shutdowns in our markets gives us even more of a cause for optimism. If demand is this strong now, we think that when the vaccines are more fully distributed and cities reopened, our business will really hum. The fact that this is likely to coincide with our traditional leasing season with its higher seasonal demand positions us especially well. Admittedly, though pricing remains weak, but there are signs of the beginnings of improvement. As we noted in the presentation, pricing trends have turned up over the past few months, led by our urban core markets of New York City, the city of San Francisco and the cities of Boston and Cambridge. We also see declining forward concessions. With occupancy firming and strong demand going into our busiest time of the year, we believe that we can recover considerable ground on the pricing side as 2021 plays out. While we see signs of recovery, our current results reflect the still challenging climate in many of our markets. You may remember that on prior calls, I made clear that the impact of lower rents and higher concessions in 2020 and currently, will take some time to fully manifest itself in our reported numbers. That impact arrived in the form of our fourth quarter 2020 same-store revenue results as we continue entering into new leases and renewing existing leases at lower rents, reflecting the post pandemic leasing climate as well as amortizing concessions from leases written in 2020. But just as our reported results lagged, our actual operating environment on the way down, they will also lag it on the way up. So, you should expect relatively weak same-store revenue results in the first half of 2021, with a marked improvement in our revenue numbers in the second half of the year as we benefit from improving pricing, higher occupancy and lower concessions plus easier post pandemic comparable periods.  The interplay of our expectations of increasing occupancy, pricing that is improving, but will be lower than last year\u2019s pricing until midyear or so, and the amortization of 2020 and \u201821 concessions creates considerable modeling complexity for us and for our investors and analysts. Because of this more complex picture than usual, we thought it was particularly important that we reinstate guidance to give investors a better idea of management\u2019s view of the year. Our guidance has a wider than usual range to account for the multitude of factors, both positive and negative, that may impact our business in 2021. While I certainly acknowledge that the pandemic has created unique challenges, Equity Residential same-store revenue growth, coming out of recessions, is typically recovered quickly with us posting strong numbers, and I see no reason that will not occur again once the lagging impact of concessions and some of the other factors I mentioned abate. All of this is, of course, premised on the continuing progress in controlling the virus and an assumption that other general economic conditions remain supportive. Turning to the long term, we believe that the fundamental factors that have long made Equity Residential an attractive place to invest your capital remain just as true now as before the pandemic. First, our capital is invested in markets that will continue to be the centers of the knowledge economy that drives the growth of this country, centers of innovation in technology, finance, entertainment, medicine and life sciences.  Even in the pandemic, we have seen announcements of new high-quality jobs in our urban centers like Amazon\u2019s announcement that it\u2019s putting 3,000 new technology and software development jobs in the Seaport District of Boston. And with the recent commencement of construction on Disney\u2019s new building in Hudson Square in New York, that will lead to a significant influx of new content creation and technology jobs. And while the remote work trend may change the number of days that we are in the office, we are, by our nature, social animals. Our need to interact with each other to create, to share ideas, to manage our businesses and to start new ones is not being met by meetings on a video screen. Second, we believe that the entertainment, cultural and social attractions that fill the great urban centers in which we operate will soon reopen, and will again prove to be magnets for affluent renters. We believe that many renters desire both the work proximity I just mentioned as well as easy access to the amazing entertainment, cultural and social opportunities our cities will provide once they are reopened. Not to mention the ability to live in an exciting, dynamic and diverse community. Our residents that live in our more urban properties do so because they value the lifestyle of our country\u2019s great urban centers. Third, we have a highly skilled affluent customer base, able to afford our rent and will accept future rent increases as conditions improve. Our residents are well employed in growing industries like technology, biotech and new media. Industries that we also think are less susceptible over time, the job loss from increasing waves of automation and offshoring. In the pandemic period, overall unemployment rose to almost 15% and is now around 6%, while job losses for those with a bachelor\u2019s degree or better, which is our target demographic, peaked at 8.4% and has now gone down to 3.8%. Our resident base proved its quality again in the fourth quarter as we collected 97% of our expected residential revenues. We think the quality of our customer base is, over the long haul, one of our greatest strengths. Fourth, the superior location and quality of our portfolio makes our properties attractive places for our residents to live, and it also makes our properties attractive places for private investors to invest their capital. This makes our properties liquid and appreciating over the long term. Capital has long been drawn to the higher quality properties we own, and that will continue to be the case, even in markets like New York and San Francisco once the pandemic abates. We also believe that the lower long-term capital spending required to maintain our properties and income stream compares favorably with that of older, lower quality apartment buildings. But our portfolio can always be improved and you should expect this to be more active recyclers of capital over the next few years. As I have said on prior calls, even before the pandemic, in order to create the most stable and growing cash flow stream possible for our investors, we are inclined to further diversify our portfolio in the higher end suburban locations in our current markets as well as into a few select new markets with favorable long-term supply and demand characteristics and a growing affluent renter base. These affluent renters are found in abundance in our existing markets, but there are also increasing concentrations of them in denser suburbs near city centers of our existing markets and in places like Denver, which is a market we reentered in 2016. You have seen us do this over the last few years as we have acquired properties in suburban Seattle and Washington DC, with strong resident demographics. We are looking hard at several other suburban assets as well as development and acquisition opportunities in Denver that we find appealing in long term. We will fund this by lowering our concentration of assets in city centers in our existing markets, and by exiting assets elsewhere that do not meet our return parameters. To close, we have the best team in the business, ready to maximize results when the pandemic ends and a sturdy balance sheet that gives us ample flexibility. We are tremendously optimistic about our company\u2019s future because we believe that the markets in which we operate will thrive when we get to the other side of this pandemic. And with the rollout of vaccines, we are on our way. I will now turn the call over to Michael Manelis. Michael Manelis : Thanks Mark. So, 2020 has been the most challenging year that we have faced in our business, so let me start by thanking the entire Equity Residential team for their continued dedication and hard work throughout the year. Working together, we got through 2020 by serving our customers, taking care of each other and driving the best results possible given the circumstances. Despite the challenges, we are excited that 2020 is behind us and optimistic that 2021 will be a year of recovery. As Mark mentioned, we have begun to see improvements in both physical occupancy and pricing. Notably, this is the first time this has occurred since the beginning of the pandemic. We continue to test price sensitivity in many markets by reducing both the value and quantity of concessions being granted and beginning to raise rates.  In November, concessions averaged just over 6 weeks free on about 45% of our applications. In recent weeks, concessions have averaged just under 6 weeks on only about one-third of our applications. All that said, it will take some time to fully recover from the unprecedented events that have occurred, particularly in our hardest hit markets. While we are optimistic about the recovery, it is hard to handicap its pace, especially in New York and San Francisco, our hardest hit cities. On Page 3 of the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key performance metrics broken out by our urban core, urban other and suburban portfolios. I will not walk through all the specific metrics in the presentation, but I do want to highlight some of the performance indicators we remain focused on. So first, demand, demand continues to be robust and has carried us through much of the winter season with increased move-in activity well above seasonal norms. Application counts exceeded 2019 levels by 25% in the fourth quarter, and we were able to generate sufficient front door activity to have move-ins outpace move-outs despite higher turnover compared to the 2019 record low level. We haven\u2019t seen this net gain in move-ins since the onset of the pandemic. Applications have remained robust in January, albeit below December\u2019s levels, but that isn\u2019t surprising since improved occupancy has allowed us to start testing pricing, and we have fewer units available to sell. Turning to pricing, the chart on pricing trend, which includes the impact on concessions, is a good indicator of where rents are headed, and it has been improving across both the urban and suburban markets for the last 8 weeks or so. Blended rates, which combines new lease changes and renewal rates achieved, will continue to be negative for some time as this metric compares new leases written or renewed with those that were before the pandemic began. That said, the rate of change of blended rates has flattened. And for the first time, we have seen modest sequential improvement in new lease rates, which is helpful. We continue to experience negotiation pressure on renewal rates and we are still renewing residents who signed leases pre-pandemic. We have found some stability in the percent of residents renewing, which stands at approximately 52% in January. We expect that to improve to around 54% for February and March, which is still below our usual retention rates for this time of year. Before moving to market commentary, I want to summarize that while the operating environment remains challenging, we continue to see good demand for our product, and we are starting to see early signs of pricing improvement. We have a long way to go, but recovery is in sight. Now, let me provide some brief market commentary. Starting with Boston, strong application volume and improved retention through the fourth quarter resulted in steady gains in occupancy to position us to 95.5% today. This market has been dialing back concession use and raising rates consecutively for the past 4 weeks. At present, concessions are being used on about 25% to 30% of our applications and averaging right at 6 weeks, which is compared to 50% used back in November. Going forward, we expect modest improvement in rates, but acknowledge that a full recovery will require additional demand drivers, like the Amazon jobs Mark mentioned in his remarks, to aid in the absorption of the new supply that is being delivered currently and anticipated through the year. Long-term demand drivers remain positive, with a very bullish outlook for biotech and pharma space, fueling job creation. At this point, it is hard to forecast exactly how some of the traditional demand drivers associated with Boston play out, notably students, both domestic and international, and the jobs that support that infrastructure. We expect to have a better view on these by late spring, early summer before the fall semester. Anecdotally, I will tell you that January did see a few applications from foreign addresses, which we haven\u2019t seen for several months. Boston will have its challenges in \u201821, but its performance over the last 2 months has definitely improved. In 2021, we look to regain more occupancy, which will allow us to then recapture some of the rate we lost last year. New York continues to feel the outsized impact from the pandemic, but there are early signs of recovery. We recently had our best traffic week in the last 12 months and our best leasing week since August. Leasing activity is still driven by deal seekers and intracity movers, which is running about 10 points higher than normal. We still see move-outs to the suburbs in New Jersey and Connecticut, but that number is normalizing. Occupancy has improved in the market and is just above 91.5%, which is the first time we have been over 90% since September of 2020. Some additional color on recent traffic includes that we are just now starting to have former residents reaching out to our property teams, contemplating moving back to the city. Like in Boston, we are seeing the first signs of international students and specific to New York, UN workers looking to come back. And finally, we saw a few roommate type prospects emerging from their parents\u2019 basements. Many of these prospects are looking for late spring or early summer time frames in anticipation of their offices opening back up. We still see a good amount of deal hoppers and upgraders as well as prospects from the outer boroughs who can now afford to live in Manhattan, and many of them are telling our on-site teams, they think the market bottom is near, and they don\u2019t want to miss out. Concessions remain prevalent in this market with 70% of the applications receiving about 2 months free. Rates are beginning to show signs of improvement, and we are just starting to gradually dial back concessions. For 2021, our focus in New York will be recapturing as much of the occupancy rate as possible while lowering and possibly eliminating the use of concessions. While the market will still produce a negative decline for the year, New York has upside potential given the dramatic declines we saw in 2020. Recovery in this market will be fueled by a lack of competitive new supply, the return to office and the continued growth of the big tech employers in the market. Moving to DC, which has been our most resilient market on the East Coast, occupancy remained solid at 95.5%, but the market continues to feel the impact from the delivery of Class A multifamily product, which is not being absorbed as efficiently in previous years. Federal government employment has grown, but the overall job growth has declined. Concession use was up in the quarter with the largest amount focused in the district. The good news, however, is that as fast as concessions came into the market during the fourth quarter, they have now been greatly reduced. Since mid-December, we are only using concessions on 15% of the applications, and they\u2019ve been averaging just below 1 month. 2021 will be focused on balancing occupancy and rate as we face supply pressure from yet another 12,000 units being delivered into the market. Recent signs of improvement provide us more confidence in the market\u2019s ability to absorb the new units and allow for continued rate recovery, which could make DC one of our better performing markets in 2021. Heading West, Denver, albeit a small portfolio for us, is holding up well. For 2021, all 5 of our Denver communities will be included in the same-store results. Occupancy is sitting around 96%, and both new lease change and renewal rates are improving. Renewals are showing positive growth rates in December and January and concession use is trending down. In Seattle, we are seeing early indications that the bottom may be behind us. Occupancy continues to improve as traffic is up over January 2020 by about 6%, and we are seeing weekly application numbers that are closer to peak leasing season levels. Concessions remained common in the market, especially in the urban submarkets. During the fourth quarter, concessions averaged about 6 weeks free on about 55% of our applications. Strength in occupancy, both at our properties and more generally, in the overall market, are allowing for a gradual reduction in concessions. We have heard from our Seattle teams that many prospects seem less concerned about the monthly rate right now as they are about getting a deal. While current rent freeze restrictions may limit renewal performance in the first half of the year, overall fundamentals for this market support a recovery. Recent home price appreciation and the increase in this quarter\u2019s job postings from the technology companies should continue to drive strong demand for our product. The focus in Seattle in 2021 is maintaining the strong occupancy we currently have while pushing rate. San Francisco remains our most challenged market. But even here, there are some very early signs of recovery. Occupancy is just below 94% and has improved 150 basis points since the beginning of November. The downtown portfolio remains pressured on rate with concessions that averaged 6 weeks in the quarter on about two-thirds of our applications. January concessions improved to a 1-month average on less than half the applications. Anecdotally, stories from our teams across the bay are reporting that people who left to go to other areas like Denver and Sacramento, are now looking to move back to be near their office or in desirable school districts. The extent of the Bay Area recovery will improve as we get even more clarity on tech company\u2019s plans regarding return to office. We acknowledge that work from home will play a role, but we believe that in-person collaboration and much lower rent levels should make San Francisco attractive again. There have been headlines about corporate relocations out of state and clearly that is not a positive for the market, but it is important to keep reading. The Bay Area continues to attract venture capital and is yet to be replaced as the epicenter of the tech economy. Bay Area tech companies are also feeling a bit more optimistic and their ability to receive H1B visas under the new administration, which could increase demand in this market. Supply in \u201821 will continue to be concentrated in Oakland and in the South Bay. Feedback from our local team was that the recent lifting of the stay in home order can definitely be felt in the downtown market with much more active streets and outdoor restaurant seating filled to the new lower allowed capacity levels. These are the first signs of bringing life back to the city. Our focus in San Francisco in \u201821 is to build back our occupancy, particularly in the downtown submarket, get rid of concessions and then push rate. While San Francisco will produce a revenue decline in \u201821, it, like New York, has a lot of upside potential due to the steep decline in 2020. Finally, moving to Southern California, which continues to hold up much better than the Bay Area, despite some pretty difficult pandemic-related headlines in the LA area our Los Angeles portfolio maintained occupancy above 95% through the quarter. Concession use was modest and averaged just under 1 month on about 20% of our applications. Operationally, the story is similar to the third quarter with continued pressure from new supply in the Downtown Korea Mid Wilshire corridor. West LA continues to feel the pressure from the slow restart of online content creation, but new lease and renewal rates have shown some stability through the fourth quarter and into January. The suburban portfolio has very strong occupancy at or near 97%, and the submarkets of Inland Empire, Santa Clarita Valley and Ventura County continued to experience modest year-over-year gains in rental income. For \u201821, L.A. should be one of our better markets. We have recaptured our occupancy. Concession use has already been dialed back and now, our opportunity is on increasing rate and managing delinquency. I will finish with Orange County in San Diego, which are primarily suburban markets for us and have averaged around 97% occupancy through the quarter. These markets continue to demonstrate resilience and produced higher resident retention than in any of our other markets. Both of these markets are presenting opportunities to increase rates and are expected to continue to perform well through 2021. In closing, we remain optimistic that the early signs of recovery that we now see will continue and that through \u201821, we will build occupancy on the back of strong demand, leading to improved pricing power. Our efforts over the next several months will be focused on seeking out opportunities to maximize the trade-off between rate and occupancy, while ensuring the well-being of our employees and residents. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Bob Garechana. Bob Garechana : Thanks, Michael. This morning, I will focus on our 2021 guidance for same-store revenue and expenses, along with normalized FFO and conclude with a couple of highlights on our balance sheet before turning it over to Q&A. As part of the release and management presentation published last night, we introduced 2021 guidance after having withdrawn guidance in March 2020 due to significant uncertainties arising from the pandemic. In doing so, we acknowledge how far we progress toward the end of this pandemic, but also recognize that a significant amount of uncertainty remains. As a result, our same-store revenue, NOI and normalized FFO ranges are wider than normal. Let\u2019s start with our full year 2021 total same-store revenue guidance range, which is between negative 9% and negative 7%. Note that this guidance is on a GAAP basis since we report same-store revenues in the same manner and include the straight-lining of concessions as required. In our management presentation, we laid out a variety of scenarios under which we could achieve the top, bottom or points in between. That said, let me take a moment and highlight the main drivers that will shape revenue performance for the year, along with our thoughts on how 2021 might play out. First, physical occupancy, you heard both Mark and Michael talk about the improvements we are already seeing. We would expect this to continue and that as we get into the second quarter, occupancy should become a tailwind that begins to contribute to year-over-year improvement. Next, pricing, much like occupancy, the middle and higher ends of our guidance anticipate the pricing improvements discussed to continue both in improved leasing rates and reduced concessions. This positive trend, however, will take a little longer to manifest itself in our reported numbers. For leasing rates, it will take some time, not only to start writing new leases and renewing existing ones at levels above the prior year, but also to reset a meaningful part of the leasing book. The good news is that not only are we starting to see improving trends, these improvements may gain even more traction in time to coincide with our prime leasing season and resulting in positive year-over-year rates by midyear. The other element of pricing that is worth touching base upon is concessions. As I mentioned earlier, we recognized concessions on a straight-line basis as required by GAAP. That means as disclosed on Page 12 of the release, of the $31 million in cash residential concessions granted in 2020, we still have approximately $19 million of unamortized concessions that will reduce revenue in 2021, which is about 75 basis points of same-store revenue. Any new concessions granted in 2021 will also be straight lined. So the earlier in the year that the concession is granted, the more of it that will be recognized in the 2021 financial statements. We expect concessions granted will taper off during the first half of the year. But because of the combination that I just described, 2020 unamortized residuals and the timing of new 2021 concessions, this improvement won\u2019t fully manifest itself in 2021 reported GAAP results. And finally, some thoughts on bad debt, as Mark mentioned, our collections have remained both strong and consistent at approximately 97%. We incurred an approximately $13 million reduction in revenues for the fourth quarter 2020 due to uncollected rent. The middle range of our 2021 guidance assumes that this continues with only slight improvement very late in the year. We hope that we can do better than that. But given the regulatory environment, we remain cautious in our assumptions. In summary, our same-store revenue guidance incorporates recovery and operating fundamentals, but acknowledges both difficult comparable periods for the first half of 2020 and the reality that it will take time for improvements in the business to show up in our reported results. Specifically, same-store revenue performance will be sequentially negative from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021 and likely not improve until the second half of the year. As fundamentals improve, consistent with our expectations, reported results will catch-up from this improvement and benefit both sequentially and from a year-over-year comparison basis. We expect same-store revenue results in the second half of the year to be better than the first half results and to position us very well for continued growth and recovery. Now some color on same-store expenses. Our full year guidance range for same-store expenses is 3% to 4%. The drivers of same-store expenses remain largely unchanged. The 4 largest expense categories continue to be real estate taxes, on-site payroll, utilities and repairs and maintenance. Before I provide you a bit of color on each, I\u2019d like to remind you that 2020 will present a tough comparison period on expenses, given growth was only 2.1%. As you think about how this plays out quarterly, this comparison issue will especially be pronounced in the second quarter since many activities and corresponding expenses were halted in the first few months of the pandemic. Now, a little color on the major categories, real estate taxes are expected to grow in the mid-3% range, which is slightly lower than prior years. While municipalities continue to be stretched, we are seeing some jurisdictions provide relief on assessed values, and that, coupled with aggressive appeals activity, should help control growth. Perhaps even more pronounced this year than usual will be the timing and success of this appeals activity, which may present an outsized impact on where the number ultimately settles out. Payroll ended 2020 flat to 2019. This is the second year in a row that payroll growth has been less than 1%. And while many of our efficiency initiatives were delayed because of the pandemic, our hard-working on-site colleagues have continued to gain inefficiencies. As a result, 2020 makes for yet another difficult comparison for 2021. By continuing our efficiency initiatives and keeping our eye on the ball, we should still be able to limit payroll growth for the full year to around 2%. That leaves us with the final two categories of utilities and repairs and maintenance. Both are estimated to have more meaningful growth in the 4% to 5% range. In previous years, utilities benefited from modest or declining commodity price growth. In 2021, we are expecting higher natural gas prices which is driving our forecasted growth. For repairs and maintenance, a good amount of the growth encompasses catching up on activities that were delayed as a result of the pandemic, keeping in mind that this expense declined in 2020. Our guidance range for normalized FFO in 2021 is $2.60 per share to $2.80 per share. Major drivers for the change between our 2020 normalized FFO of $3.26 per share and the midpoint of $2.70 from our 2021 guidance include : a $0.60 decline in same-store NOI based on the revenue and expense assumptions outlined. Keep in mind that nearly 1/3 of that decline stems from the difficult comparable period in the first quarter of 2020; a $0.07 decline primarily due to disposition activity that occurred in 2020, which is more than offset by a positive $0.14 contribution from lower anticipated interest expense, predominantly due to taking those disposition proceeds and paying down nearly $1 billion in debt in 2020; and finally, a negative $0.03 in other items. The back-loaded nature of the recovery in our NOI will also, of course, impact our NFFO numbers, which should improve on the back half of 2021. A final note on the balance sheet, our financial position remains extremely strong despite the impact of the pandemic. As I just mentioned, in 2020, we paid down nearly $1 billion of debt using disposition proceeds, extended our already long weighted average maturities to 9 years and continued to reduce our weighted average rate. This activity has positioned us extremely well, ending the year with net debt to normalized EBITDA of 5.0x, nearly $2 billion in available liquidity and very limited maturities until 2023. Our access to debt capital remains excellent positioning us well for opportunities should they present themselves. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to John Pawlowski of Green Street. John Pawlowski : Great. Thanks. Maybe to start with you, Bob your opening comments there, did I hear it right that you\u2019re assuming positive year-over-year blended rates by midyear? Bob Garechana : Yes. So our guidance assumption at the midpoint is that as you approach the middle part of the year that we will start to see positive year-over-year lease rates. John Pawlowski : And presumably, you are still decidedly negative on renewals. So that would assume decidedly positive on new lease, right, am I interpreting that correctly? Bob Garechana : So when I guess I am talking about leasing rates in the guidance, I am thinking that we likely will be positive on blended which encompasses both by middle part of the year, encompasses both new lease and renewal rates. Mark Parrell : John, just to add some color, it\u2019s Mark. Yes, just to add some color that will get your clarification in. That is partly because things are recovering and getting better, that\u2019s partly because the 2020 comp periods are declining, right. Rates declined and they declined particularly hard late in the second quarter and through the third. So, we look at this line as kind of crossing these two lines in the middle of the year. And I am sorry you were asking a clarification there? John Pawlowski : Yes. No, sorry to cut you off. But renewal rates through the year, beginning midyear, are they \u2013 are renewal rates positive still? Michael Manelis : Yes. Hey, John, this is Michael. So I think the way to think about renewals is, first and foremost, we have a pretty difficult comp period in front of us with Q1 and Q2. And then as you turn that corner, you would expect performance and renewals to start turning positive. John Pawlowski : Okay, thank you. And final one for me, Mark, your opening comments about just the liquidity of the assets and a more active capital recycler. Just curious your updated thoughts on urban Class A product along the coasts, if you are starting to test the market, how is pricing shaking out versus pre-COVID levels in some hard hit markets? Mark Parrell : Yes. Thanks, John. So, in terms of values and let\u2019s focus for just a moment on the hardest hit markets of New York and San Francisco. I start by saying there has just been very little \u2013 and you know there is very little volume, much, much less. In fact, we can sort of name the deals, the Chief Investment Officer and I that have closed. The ones that have closed, and there\u2019s one in Union Square in New York that closed right about what pre-pandemic values would have been. So that\u2019s an asset that I think was about $1,200 a foot, $900,000 a unit, at like a 3.6% tax cap rate \u2013 excuse me, very much value would have traded at before the pandemic, but it\u2019s just one deal. And I don\u2019t have a lot of others. In San Francisco, there is certainly been some stuff traded, smaller deals. I would say we\u2019re probably down 10% or so on value in San Francisco and New York. We are starting to hear from people who want to acquire assets from us in those markets. The thought being, they will ride the recovery up. We get that, and we probably \u2013 our sellers, as I implied in my remarks in those markets to some extent. Remember, we still have those 421a assets in New York that have the big tax increases. We have a big concentration in the city of San Francisco. But for us to sell much below the pre-pandemic value, it doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense because we believe in the recovery in those markets. So we think revenues are going up pretty sharply, especially in the second half of this year and into \u201822. And the idea that we would sell at a big discount doesn\u2019t make sense to me, but I think you will see us start to be more active sellers in those two places. Other places like Seattle, particularly has had a spade of sales, including a pretty large one in Bellevue, at very good pricing at pre-pandemic value or maybe even better, obviously, lower cap rates because NOI is down. So Seattle has had some strong numbers. DC too, a lot of suburban stuffs traded or a fair number of suburban things have traded. So we see that as market is holding up. I haven\u2019t seen a lot of urban stuff traded. There is some rules in DC that have come in the force that make it hard in a district to sell assets right now. So I will pause there and I hope that\u2019s responsive. John Pawlowski : It is. Well, thanks for the time. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : And we will go to our next question from Nick Joseph of Citi. Nick Joseph : Thanks. Mark, maybe just following up on that, as you look to the active recyclers over the next few years and think about these potential expansion markets, what sort of IRR differential are you underwriting between some of these assets that you maybe thinking of selling? Because as you mentioned, the values maybe down, but the growth maybe on a forward basis versus any assets that you are starting to look at or markets that you are starting to look at? Mark Parrell : Well, we all are able to boil it down to the math, but there is a lot more to it than that. I \u2013 again, we have seen deals we have underwritten, for example in Denver lately that are 7 un-levered IRR deals, maybe even some high 6s. A lot of stuff we are selling might be 1% lower than that. But of course, the assumptions matter a lot and how do you think about your recovery in rents, which is so hard to peg as you know. So, we do think that what matters in moving our capital around is ending up in the place that risk-adjusted is best. And in some cases, some of the markets also have more political risk, other markets have more supply risk, and we just got to balance that out. So there we do see, obviously, a higher IRR in the stuff we are buying than the stuff we are selling. But a lot of stuff we are selling is interesting to the buyers because they are levering it up or they have got a renovation play or some other way they are juicing their IRR that we either don\u2019t believe in or can\u2019t underwrite. So, I guess that\u2019s how I would answer. It\u2019s kind of not as mathematical as just maybe it\u2019s 1% better. Nick Joseph : No, that\u2019s very helpful. And then I appreciate all the commentary upfront and the presentation. And so as we look at the applications in the move-ins, particularly over the last 2 months, is there anything that you are seeing trends in terms of either the age or credit quality or rent to income levels relative to where you were a year ago at pre-pandemic? Michael Manelis : Yes. So Nick, this is Michael. So really, we are not seeing any kind of material shifts when we look at those applications. So we\u2019ve looked at kind of rent as a percent of income. The portfolio has always averaged somewhere right around 19% for those move-ins in the fourth quarter, we were also right at 19%. What we did see a little bit happen is the range that we used to see as rent as a percent of income, used to be from 17% to 23%, with Seattle being the low at 17% and San Diego being the high at 23%. That range has expanded a little bit to 16% and 24%, but it\u2019s really a marginal shift in this stuff. So, from the demographic side no change in the average age of applicants coming in. The income, I guess, I would tell you, when you look at New York, you have got some affordability opportunities right now. So you\u2019re seeing average incomes coming down for applications in New York, but it\u2019s still well over $220,000 a year, and the ratio is still at like 18.5%. So actually, everything we have looked at right now would suggest that all of our new applicants and all of our new residents coming in, from an affordability, from a demographic standpoint, really kind of demonstrate their ability to pay as the markets start to reaccelerate and stay with us. Nick Joseph : Thank you. Operator : And we will go to our next question from Rich Hightower of Evercore. Rich Hightower : Yes, hey, good morning guys. Thanks for all the valuable color. You actually have answered most of my questions. But I just want to get a sense, maybe in a market like New York, is there anything embedded within the forecast that\u2019s related to sort of the spring home buying season just given, for the first time in a long time, the strength in sort of the Tri-State area housing market? And do you make any assumptions around some of those related move-outs or anything along traffic or demand that might be impacted by that? Michael Manelis : So Rich, this is Michael. I will just start off and say, just overall, when we have looked at the percent of residents moving to buy homes, again, this is one of those sets we really have not seen a difference. At a portfolio level, we\u2019re running just over 12.5% of residents moving out. When you go specific to New York, we really haven\u2019t seen any material change on that front at all. It\u2019s actually declined a little bit in the fourth quarter. So I think relative to our assumptions as we move forward, I think you heard in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re starting to see some improvement in the percent of residents renewing. So for the portfolio, we are expecting to be up at 54%. New York is still one of those markets that we are off \u2013 we are off what is normal for that market. So we\u2019re still sitting below 50%, and we should be up above 60%. And so I think our modeling and our assumptions going forward is that we start to see a little bit of improvement in our ability to retain those residents, but nothing specific to them, more of them moving out to go buy homes. Mark Parrell : And Rich, it\u2019s Mark. Just to support Michael\u2019s comment. There isn\u2019t anything expressly in our guidance about increasing home purchases. Home portfolio was kind of designed not to have a lot of concerns about people moving out to buy homes. And as far as we can tell, that continues to be the case historically. Going forward, a lot of the renewals that Michael is thinking about now and a lot of these people that could elect to buy a home, these were people that renewed with us or least initially with us in the pandemic, I mean we are rolling into a period where everyone would have leased with us knowing what the situation was in New York and especially in March, April and May when it was particularly dire. So I would have thought that if they really were thinking home buying was absolutely at the top of their list, or disproportionately our population of renters thought that they already would have been in the suburbs. They already would have rented there in the hopes of buying. So I\u2019m guessing the homebuilding, home buying boom in the Tri-State area is not actually going to matter very much to us. Rich Hightower : Got it. Thanks for the comments. Mark Parrell : Thank you, Rich. Operator : And we will move to our next question from Alua Askarbek of Bank of America. Alua Askarbek : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the questions today. I appreciate all the commentary this morning. It was really helpful. But I was wondering if you guys can talk a little bit more about the suburban submarkets. It looks like the renewals are still high, but they are trending behind 2019, early 2020 and the occupancy has diverged again. So I was just wondering where are those renters headed to, the ones that aren\u2019t renewing and does it kind of tie into your commentary that the renters are looking to come back to urban? Just trying to think about if there is a shift back to urban to suburban that we have been talking about for the past year? Mark Parrell : Yes. So, I think it\u2019s a great question. And I think as we think about the forwarding address for residents that are leaving us, we still see a little bit of an elevated number in those that are leaving urban submarkets to go to suburban submarkets. When we think about our own suburban portfolio, I think a lot of what you\u2019re seeing right now, in the management presentation, a lot of that is just normal seasonality as to how the markets actually would react. And I think what we\u2019re seeing is we had strong demand, we maintained good occupancy throughout the year, and I think we\u2019re going to continue to do that with stability and start pushing rate and try to recover as much of the rate as we can in the suburban submarkets. Alua Askarbek : Okay, got it. Makes sense. And then I just have a question on lease breaks and just transfers in general. I know last quarter, you said that everything was still elevated, and that also came about from companies pushing back their start dates. But how did that trend in 4Q? Mark Parrell : Yes. So in the fourth quarter, the lease breaks is still elevated kind of on a year-over-year basis. But we are starting to see kind of that percent and the numbers start coming back into norms. I think we peaked up in September at like 36%, and the fourth quarter is now kind of gradually coming back down. We\u2019d expect this number. I think we\u2019re at like 25%, we\u2019d expect this to be coming at somewhere around 20%. Alua Askarbek : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And we will move to our next question from Amanda Sweitzer of Baird. Amanda Sweitzer : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I thought your comment on some San Francisco residents looking to move back from Sacramento and Denver were interesting, can you quantify the magnitude of that reverse migration either on an absolute basis or relative to how many residents left? Michael Manelis : So I think, first of all, those \u2013 like that\u2019s just the anecdotal statements that\u2019s coming to us. So the quantity is small, right? But every week, we\u2019re on the phone with our on-site teams, and we\u2019re just trying to get some color around the applications and where they were coming from. When we see the inflows, which is new applicants for San Francisco, 87% of all of our applications are coming to us from within the state of California, and 70% are coming from within that MSA. Both of these numbers are up about 10 points each. So you\u2019re still seeing that elevated kind of activity, which to us, is still that deal seeker, right? They\u2019re coming in, they\u2019re taking advantage of that price. So from the out migration in, those states, where people have left and are coming back, it\u2019s just starting to trickle in. It hasn\u2019t really manifested itself into a large enough percentage change. But I think the positive is, is that we haven\u2019t heard any of that for months. And now we\u2019re just now starting to hear that. Amanda Sweitzer : Yes, that\u2019s helpful color. And then following-up on some of your demographics comments, I know the percentage of your residents with children is still kind of a small piece of your overall portfolio. But have you seen a change in that percentage, either among your existing base or the applications you\u2019re seeing come in? Mark Parrell : Yes, so about 10% of our residents have children living with them. We haven\u2019t seen a change in that trend. And part of that is, I mean, our portfolio hasn\u2019t changed. It still has a limited number of 3-bedroom units. It\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s a fair number of one-bedrooms and studios. So I wouldn\u2019t expect that, Amanda, to change very much just because again, our portfolio is more suited to couples and a few roommate situations and some families, certainly, but it\u2019s just \u2013 it is like we added 3-bedroom units to the portfolio to make it more family-friendly in the last couple of quarters. Amanda Sweitzer : That makes sense. Thanks for the time. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll go to our next question from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Thanks. Good morning. Mark, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you are optimistic on a recovery in urban markets, just given the social and cultural aspects. But at the same time, you\u2019re looking to reduce your urban exposure. So can you just marry those two comments together? And also maybe quantify where you\u2019re looking to get your urban exposure to over time? Mark Parrell : Great. Thanks for those questions, John. So, there is a surface inconsistency there. I mean what our overall strategic goal is, as I said, is to just have a growing and steadily growing dividend and cash flow of the business. And to do that, the management team, even before the pandemic and the Board, had decided that we were going to spread our capital again, into these dense suburban areas around our urban centers, while still maintaining a significant urban center presence and into a few new markets or renewed markets in the case of Denver. So that was the plan. We do think there\u2019s going to be a pretty good recovery in these urban centers, and we think 1 of 2 things is going to happen. We\u2019re either going to be able to sell those assets now with the buyer understanding that they\u2019re going to need to pay close to \u2013 close or at pre-pandemic value because they\u2019re almost certain, in our opinion, at least to obtain a pretty good increase in revenue over the next couple of years, or we are going to wait and our shareholders who have suffered with the downside of the reduction in the urban centers will get that benefit.  And then we\u2019ll sell a few of those assets later. So, it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t believe in the urban centers, we\u2019ll stay over-weighted to them, but not this over-weighted. And in terms of exact numbers, we have 9 significant buildings in the city of San Francisco. That\u2019s probably more than we need to have, but exactly how many should leave or go, I\u2019m not sure. On the other hand, we did buy assets in the Bay Area. And we\u2019re thinking about developing a couple of deals. They\u2019re just more Peninsula or East Bay or just sort of spreading the capital out. You saw our development deal, John, that\u2019s sitting on the island just outside of Oakland. So you should just sort of expect a decline in the city of San Francisco and overall, California, just again, because of the concentrated political risk there. I don\u2019t have an order of magnitude to give you, but that\u2019s a source.  And New York composed predominantly at Brooklyn and Manhattan. Again, we have significant number, approaching 30 buildings in that area and to get rid of a few of those buildings at the right price. We are looking at a development deal in the tri-state area, we\u2019ve acquired in Jersey City over the last year or two. So, it\u2019s not like we are not interested in staying invested in the area. It\u2019s just spreading the money out a little bit. So, I guess I\u2019d have you stay tuned for the exact numbers, but you should expect a lessening in California, specifically the city of San Francisco and a lessening in New York provided pricing makes sense and an increase in a place like Denver and in some of these suburban places as well as maybe another couple of markets. John Kim : It sounds like you think the urbanization trends that has occurred in the last decade have peaked. Is that a fair characterization? Mark Parrell : No. I think they\u2019re spreading out more. I think new places are urbanizing. I think New York will continue to be a great urban center and San Francisco will eventually recover. But I think places like Denver now have an urban center. It\u2019s not as dense as it needs to be, but it\u2019s attractive, and we have 3 buildings in Downtown Denver, and those are well occupied. So I guess I\u2019d say, I think the trend towards urbanization, I think, is inexorable over the whole world and in the United States. I think it gets thrown off kilter for temporary periods of time like the pandemic. I think what\u2019s going on in the United States is other places. And again, Denver is an example, Austin, Texas, start to become more dense and become more attractive for a variety of reasons. So there\u2019s just going to be more cities. I mean Seattle joined the party 15 years ago in regards to having a really significant downtown. So I just think some of these other cities are also densifying, but I don\u2019t believe that urbanization is going to end in the United States. I think it\u2019s just merely been interrupted. John Kim : Okay. I appreciate the insight. Thank you. I just had a follow-up question on your urban core operating metrics and the improvement in pricing that we\u2019ve seen, which is on Page 6 of your presentation. But I just wanted to clarify, the pricing trend that you\u2019re showing, this is base rents and not affected rents. Is that correct? Michael Manelis : This is base rent, but it includes \u2013 it\u2019s a net effective. So it includes the impact of the concession. So basically, if you scraped our website and you looked at every single one of our units, what we\u2019d be charging, it\u2019s the rent, the amenity, rent \u2013 amenitized rent and the impact of that concession. John Kim : Okay, thank you. Mark Parrell : Thanks, John. Operator : And we\u2019ll go to our next question from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Haendel St. Juste: Hey, good morning out there. Mark Parrell : Good morning. Haendel St. Juste: I appreciate the color on asset pricing and your thoughts on your portfolio exposures. I was hoping you could talk a bit more about how new ground-up development fits in your thinking here with asset pricing very full in your footprint as you outlined and noticeably more optimistic today versus prior quarters? What\u2019s the current thinking here in development? Your peers, certainly, a number of the Sunbelt peers have been adding projects to their development pipeline in the quarter. You still have 3, 1 of which is in a JV. So curious if you\u2019re \u2013 sounds like you are more inclined based on your answer to a prior question. Are you just not finding the opportunities? The returns are not attractive enough yet. And maybe how much you would like to expand that pipeline, too? Mark Parrell : Yes. Thanks, Haendel. I appreciate that question. So, I think all three of our development deals that you now see in the supplementary disclosure are going to deliver this year. We\u2019ll certainly be in lease-up for some time. We\u2019ve been looking at a couple of deals. We started nothing in 2020. That just didn\u2019t seem prudent to us given the circumstances. There are at least two deals we like that we would consider starting this deal \u2013 this year, pardon me. One is in the District of Columbia proper. It\u2019s in an emerging neighborhood. We really like some of the highest per foot rents in the city, an area that, though it suffered in the pandemic, not as much as a lot of other neighborhoods. So really like the location. And because of TOPA, and I know you\u2019ve been around a lot, so you know what TOPA is, but the quick brief there as it\u2019s a law that gives residents the right to purchase their building if it\u2019s being sold in the District of Columbia. And it makes it quite difficult to sell or to acquire properties that are newly built and have a resident base, so, building like we have done before, near Union station in that NoMa area, you should expect us to do that occasionally. And to fund this by selling some of the older product we own on Wisconsin Avenue and Connecticut Avenue. So I would expect that, that deal would likely start this year. Another one is in suburban California in a location with some really powerful employer drivers nearby that we really like. The very unique thing about the deal and \u2013 is that\u2019s a density play. It\u2019s us knocking down 60 units of an existing property and putting 220 or 230 units back. So it\u2019s very efficient from a capital and return point of view. Again, it\u2019s a place we really like. It\u2019s a hard, hard place to build. So we like that. The team is very busy. We\u2019re looking at a whole bunch of stuff. As I implied in my remarks, there is a couple of things in Denver, we\u2019re thinking about as development opportunities, again. We\u2019d like to get a bigger presence there. The deals we\u2019re looking at are either path of growth, I\u2019d say, between urban and suburban or suburban development. So I\u2019d expect us to start those two deals I just mentioned, maybe one or two other things, we\u2019ll see. We think development is part of the mix here at the company, and we\u2019ll continue to do them as they sort of pencil out. Haendel St. Juste: Any preliminary color on potentially what yield of spread versus cap rates of IRRs could look like? Mark Parrell : Yes, that\u2019s a terrific question because of how hard that is. You\u2019ve hit on the nub of the hardest underwriting part is what are \u2013 first of all, what are spot rents? When spot rents are going down in a lot of these places. So what does spot rent mean? And then you come back and unfortunately, 3 months later, spot rent has changed. And how do you think about rent growth? So you\u2019re going to be building these buildings for 3 years. I mean they\u2019re going to deliver in 2022 \u2013 excuse me, 2023, early 2024. You may be delivering into \u2013 you will be delivering into certainly, a very different climate and maybe a much more advantageous one. So we spend a lot of time thinking about just that. So I can\u2019t really give you a yield if we start the deals, I will talk about that. But it is \u2013 just as important as your starting rate is your rent growth assumption, when do you get back to where you were? Do you get back to where you were? How does that work? And that\u2019s the art of this process. Haendel St. Juste: Got it, got it. Thanks for the color. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go to our next question from Brent Dilts of UBS. Brent Dilts : Hey, guys. Thanks. You\u2019ve answered most of my questions, but just one last one here for me is how is demand trending by unit size? And how is that differing by urban or suburban or even MSA, if you have that data? Mark Parrell : Yes. So I don\u2019t have the actual demand in totality. I will tell you that studios continue to be our most challenged unit type. So I think our overall occupancy in studios is like 93% compared to \u2013 they used to be the highest, just over 96%. And if you drill into those studios and you look at like New York and San Francisco, the occupancies of studios are down at like 85%, 86%. So I think you could say that the demand that\u2019s coming into us is still seeking kind of that one-bedroom, the larger units, even the 2-bedrooms because that is where that occupancy improvement has come from. And I think right now, we\u2019re just kind of in the wait-and-see mode to understand at what price can we clear these studios out. And when does that demand really start to return to these markets. Brent Dilts : Okay, thanks. Appreciate it. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go next to Alexander Goldfarb of Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good morning. So two questions. First, as you guys look over your expirations in the next few months, to call it, March into June, do you have a sense for how many of those residents are planning to move out? Or are people not sort of indicating yet their intentions of whether or not they plan to renew or move out? And I am really focused on obviously, the major hard hit markets like New York, San Francisco, Austin. Michael Manelis : Yes. Alex, this is Michael. So right now, we\u2019ve just started issuing April renewal offers out there. So it\u2019s hard to get kind of that indicator from residents. I will tell you, in the prepared remarks, you could see, I think we\u2019re going to be moving from the 52% that we were in January, up to 54%, maybe even 55%, as you work your way through February and March. At this time, I don\u2019t expect like the April and Mays to do anything materially different. I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019re going to get back into the 60% retention rate, but you got to remember, at the onset of the pandemic, we had a lot of residents choose to renew with us that drove that kind of number up. So I think we should expect this kind of gradual improvement in retention. And I think the improvement that you\u2019re seeing is really systemic across all the markets. But again, I have the most improvement to gain or the most area to make up in San Francisco and New York. And I think at this point, it\u2019s too early to understand May, June and July kind of timeframes. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then, Mark, on the portfolio, it\u2019s great to hear that you guys are considering some new markets in addition to expanding in Denver. As you guys look back over the history of the company, though, EQR has more from the El Paso or the sort of Midwest low-rise to sort of urban culminating with Archstone and now you\u2019re sort of going back. But in that process, there was dilution and that investors took as far as earnings. As you envision the next markets that you\u2019re going to enter and the transitioning to decrease your exposure in some of the majors like New York or San Francisco, do you envision like that same sort of dilution or the way you guys see it, you can see it sort of in a modest pace that earnings can still grow and so that we don\u2019t go through that same dilution that we experienced previously? Mark Parrell : Thanks, Alex. It\u2019s Mark. So I would have told you before the pandemic that, that effort would have been accretive slightly, that we\u2019d be selling New York at 4% or slightly sub-4% cap rate and we\u2019d be buying Denver and a 4.75%, and it will all be happy and easy. Now I think those two cap rates are close to each other. Part of that is a product of what\u2019s going on in New York and San Francisco. But I don\u2019t envision this to be a dilutive exercise. I think it isn\u2019t going to be an accretive one. I think it\u2019s going to be about even now. And I think what we\u2019re buying in some of these new markets is probably better political risk, a little bit better cash flow in these assets over the long haul. And maintaining exposure, though, to these big urban centers where you have a lot of affluent renters and for New York, a really good supply picture. That\u2019s good. And I think what we\u2019ll have then is just more opportunities to invest and develop across a larger number of markets and the steadier platform win inevitable issues come up in the future. So I don\u2019t expect dilution from the process. Again, I would have told you in early \u201819, I was hoping there\u2019d be accretion in the process, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s realistic right now. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. But it is market as a positive. I mean, you guys certainly are good on the deal side and obviously there is markets with more growth. So it\u2019s good to see you guys pursuing this. Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go to our next question from Nick Yulico of Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : Thanks. Just a couple of questions. I guess, first, in terms of the improvement that you\u2019ve seen in January in terms of occupancy and also pricing. I guess, I\u2019m just wondering what we should really be reading into that? Because I think, typically, you do, like most of multifamily, gain some occupancy to start the year versus the fourth quarter. And yet both periods are very slow leasing period. So I\u2019m just kind of wondering what we should really be taking out of this about your confidence level of getting some improvement in these two quarters, which are, again, not really where you make your year, which is second quarter, third quarter in terms of occupancy and rent? What is really giving you guys confidence about your ability to do better in the spring? Is it actually something you\u2019re seeing in the data right now? Or is it more of your view about just people returning to cities and that could create leasing demand? Mark Parrell : Yes. Thanks Nick. It\u2019s Mark. I\u2019m going to start, and I think Michael is going to supplement. But the fact that we\u2019re seeing \u2013 we agree with you, there is a seasonal improvement in occupancy that starts to incur now, and there\u2019s certainly an improvement in rate that starts to occur now. The fact that our numbers are obeying the normal seasonal norms of our business is a very positive thing because they didn\u2019t in 2020. Occupancy rate, all those things declined when they usually went up. So the fact that our markets, and I remind everyone on the call, I mean, December and January and November, especially the end of November were horrible for the pandemic, particularly in California, which is almost half our NOI, and it got tough again in New York. So we would say, Nick, under difficult circumstances, our properties, our portfolio started to perform like it normally does. And if it performs like it normally does, that means rate and occupancy are going to keep going up every week through the end of the third quarter, and that to us is very encouraging. I\u2019d also add it\u2019s the setup. At 95% occupied, Michael and his pricing team and our colleagues in the field feel much more comfortable reducing concessions and starting to push rate when they\u2019re this well occupied. When you\u2019re on your back heels, it\u2019s harder to do. So I would say we\u2019re positioned well going in the leasing season. And just being normal is an advantage from what went on in the third and fourth quarter. I don\u2019t know, Michael, if you have something you\u2019d add? Michael Manelis : Yes. I think I would just give a little bit of context. So normally, you\u2019re right, we run about 20% of the volume in Q1, 30% in Q2, 30% in Q3, and then it falls back to about 20% in Q4. The actual, the velocity and the strength of the leasing season that we had in Q3 and Q4 of 2020 has actually shifted this profile a little bit, and put us now for 35% of our leases expiring in the third quarter of 21% and 22% in the fourth quarter. So I actually view this as a little bit of a positive that we shifted some of these expirations to be back-half loaded, which gives us more time to even recover some of this rate and then get through those leases. Nick Yulico : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Appreciate that. I guess just one last question is, could you give a sense for where you think in-place rents are for your portfolio versus the market? Just trying to kind of gauge the level of above-market leases you still have to deal with in the portfolio that could be expiring in coming quarters? Mark Parrell : Yes. So I think you are referring to gain in loss to lease. So basically, just snapshotting kind of our rents in place and comparing it to the existing rent rule. Sitting here, and I did this basically at the end of January. Our gain-to-lease was 6.5%, not including concessions, 9.5% when you fold it in concessions, and that is clearly front-loaded. So the numbers are \u2013 we have much higher gains in that Q1, and then it starts to kind of gradually down. We actually flip to kind of the loss to lease model back in that fourth quarter. But I think at this point, you\u2019re looking at this at the lowest point in the rent seasonality, rents are the lowest, and you\u2019re comparing this still against people that were pre-pandemic and then new people. So I don\u2019t really \u2013 I mean, I think it\u2019s a good snapshot to understand what could be. But I think really over the next couple of months, this number is going to move around a little bit. Michael Manelis : And the other thing, the number is useful for, Nick, is you\u2019ve got checking and the investors now got checking our guidance. So when people try and understand that, to understand where they gain the leases, gives you some idea of where our starting point is and what we need to make up during the course of the year. Nick Yulico : Okay. Thank you, Mark and Michael. Appreciate it. Mark Parrell : Thanks Nick. Operator : And we\u2019ll go at Alex Kalmus of Zelman & Associates. Alex Kalmus : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Looking at the projects in the pipeline and expected lease-ups over the next year, it seems like there\u2019s a lot more projects in the urban markets. Granted there\u2019s some supply chain and construction delays in typical in those markets. But what are your expectations for the coming year in the urban core? Mark Parrell : So I just want to make sure I understand your question, Alex. So you ask us what we see for supply in, call it, New York, Central New York and San Francisco kind of in \u201821? Alex Kalmus : Correct. Thank you. Michael Manelis : Yes. So I\u2019ll just start at the top and just say, so right now, when you think about the natural shifts that happened between the fourth quarter into the first quarter. When we look at supply for \u201820 and \u201821, we think the overall numbers is going to be relatively the same. I think you picked up in my prepared remarks, San Francisco is elevated, and a lot of that is the concentration sitting in South Bay. When you look at markets like New York, it\u2019s really nonexistent in Manhattan from a competitive landscape against us. And we have a little bit in the Hudson Waterfront. So, when we think about supply, we are looking at these numbers in totality, but we really go granular. We go down to an individual asset, and we\u2019re looking at what new deliveries are coming at us or what existing deliveries are still kind of working their way through their lease-up process. And what pressure do we think that, that\u2019s going to have on us in terms of performance as we work our way through the year. So it\u2019s a very granular process. And I think when we roll it all up, right now, you\u2019ve got \u2013 you still have a lot of supply coming at you in D.C., so another 12,000 units being delivered. The question there is really just the ability for the market to absorb that supply. From a competitive standpoint, I really stand back and just say the South Bay and San Francisco and a little bit in the Peninsula is going to have a little bit more pressure on us than we have felt in the past. Mark Parrell : And Alex, it\u2019s Mark. If I can just add something on some sort of new research we\u2019ve done to try and think about just new starts, so not completions, as Michael was referring, but starts as we look at \u2013 just \u2013 it\u2019s tough to make these deals pencil in the urban centers. So we\u2019re trying to determine what does it look like in \u201823. And a couple of our guys, it\u2019s really good work, and the work was focused on, what do we see starting within, call it, 2 miles of our properties, remembering that all supply in a market is competitive with us. But Michael would tell you and our operators would tell you that the supply that\u2019s very close is what is most damaging to our rent roll. So looking at what\u2019s relatively close to us, looking at what starts were from 2016 to 2019 by market, getting an average and comparing that to what we saw in \u201820 and \u201821. What we see that\u2019s being generated in \u201821, will lead us to believe that starts are likely to be down 30%, and thus deliveries are down 30% in, say, 2023, especially in our urban markets. Now in Washington, DC that number seems completely unaffected. I mean starts seem relatively constant. But we are seeing that, and we hope that, that\u2019s an additional tailwind. But again, this is relatively new research that our folks have done that we think is informing us to our optimism about supply close in urban center coming forward. Alex Kalmus : Really appreciate the color. Thank you. And\u2026 Mark Parrell : Thank you. Alex Kalmus : Moving to the bad debt assumptions in the revenue guidance you gave. Is a lot of that predicated on California\u2019s decision to extend AB-3088 into June? And is that the most sensitive aspect to that bad debt assumption or are there other regulatory or macroeconomic factors that would cause up or down based on that? Mark Parrell : I think our somewhat increased pessimism about bad debt over the last 2 months was based on both the new administration, doing its extension under its CDC Authority, California doing an extension, New York, all these markets sort of chiming in, given that the pandemic got challenging again in the fourth quarter and in January that all this got extended, which meant that we wouldn\u2019t get resolution. But I will say that we didn\u2019t \u2013 and this is why our guidance, as Bob acknowledged, was a little conservative remains in our minds, maybe a little conservative on bad debt, is that we didn\u2019t take into account either the $25 billion that was passed in the old administration\u2019s bill in December for rental relief. New York put rules out last \u2013 yesterday on that. California put those out a week ago. We\u2019re still analyzing all of that. So we\u2019re not sure. We certainly intend to get involved there and make sure our residents, who are in a delinquency situation, are aware of that and can take advantage of it. So we may get some benefit there from taking advantage of some of those programs. The Biden administration $1.9 trillion program has another $25 billion in it for rent for helping folks that are behind in their rents, so rental assistance. Again, who knows if that passes, but that\u2019s very helpful. Along with in the $1.9 trillion bill is $350 million of aid to cities. And that is tremendously helpful to places like New York, we\u2019re thinking about tax increases or service cuts. And so I\u2019ve taken your question a little longer, but I think it\u2019s important that some of these government restrictions are problematic, but they come with some good things as well, especially for owners like us of apartments that are in more urban settings. Alex Kalmus : Appreciate it. Thank you very much. Mark Parrell : Thanks, Alex. Operator : And with no further questions in the queue, Mr. McKenna, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Mark Parrell : Yes. It\u2019s Mark Parrell. Well, thank you all for your interest in Equity Residential and have a good day. Take care. Operator : That does conclude the call. I would like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Equity Residential First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Martin McKenna. Please go ahead, sir. Martin McKenna : Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's first quarter 2021 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; and Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer, is here with us as well for the Q&A. Our earnings release as well as a management presentation regarding our results and outlook are posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now I'll turn the call over to Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Thanks, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. We are pleased to report that we are seeing significant improvement in our operations, driven by continued strong demand all across our portfolio. This, in turn, allowed us to extend the gains in occupancy we discussed on the prior earnings call. We are currently 96% occupied, 160 basis point improvement since December 31, 2020. We are especially encouraged by our numbers as we enter our primary leasing season, the period of peak demand in our business and by the continuing reopening activities in our cities. The improving pricing we noted on last quarter's call has accelerated over the past few months. Pricing trend, which is a leading indicator of where market rents are going and is computed net of concessions, is up 14% this year, and we have already recovered 60% of the pricing reduction we suffered as a result of the pandemic. In fact, on a pricing trend basis, collective pricing in our markets outside of New York and San Francisco is likely to recover completely by the end of May. The New York and San Francisco markets declined by more than our other markets, so they have further to go to regain pre-pandemic pricing, but momentum is strong in those two markets, and they are making good progress towards full recovery. To provide additional color on our operating trends, we posted to our website at equityapartments.com, a management presentation that provides some background on both current operations and our guidance expectations. After I give a quick overview of guidance changes and investment activities, Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide more detail on our current performance and forward trajectory. After that, we'll take your questions. The encouraging trends, I just mentioned, led us to raise our guidance ranges for physical occupancy, same-store revenue, same-store net operating income and normalized funds from operations as disclosed in last night's release. The midpoint of our same-store revenue range was raised 100 basis points to negative 7%, the midpoint of our NOI range was raised 150 basis points to negative 12% and the midpoint of our NFFO range was raised by $0.05 to $2.75 per share. These improvements were almost entirely driven by stronger and earlier than anticipated recovery trends in both our residential and non-residential operations across all our markets. We are well positioned heading into our prime leasing season, but our reported same-store revenue numbers will lag the recovery in our operating statistics as we work through the impact of lower rents and of concessions. In terms of the first quarter's numbers, the impact of the pandemic is readily apparent. We said previously that our reported same-store revenue numbers would get worse before they get better, and that's exactly what happened. Same-store revenues declined 10.5% for the quarter, which, while it was a bit better than we expected, is still among the worst revenue numbers in our history. We believe that our first quarter results will be our low point for the year and that they will improve from this point on. Turning to investments. While no dispositions or acquisitions closed this quarter, we have been active in the transaction market, and we expect to have a considerable amount of activity to report on next quarter. As we've said on prior calls, in order to create the most stable, growing cash flow stream possible for our investors, we are broadening our portfolio over time to increase our exposure to suburban properties in our existing markets, where the resident demographic is similar to our existing affluent urban resident population. We are also working on increasing our investment in Denver and continuing to consider a select number of new markets, that have large and growing affluent resident bases, favorable long-term supply and demand characteristics and lower political risk. While asset prices are high in the locations in which we seek to invest, our funding source for these acquisitions comes from sales of existing properties, especially in California, where we are obtaining pricing that exceeds our pre-pandemic valuations. We expect to complete this transaction activity with minimal dilution and to stay consistent with our strategy of acquiring newer assets with modest capital expenditure burdens. The one piece of notable investment activity that did occur in the quarter was our $5 million investment and a fund that preserves affordable housing across our country. This for profit fund is run by long time experts in the affordable housing preservation and finance area. Using our equity capital and that of other investors as well as government financing, the fund acquires and improves the quality of existing affordable housing communities that would otherwise be at risk of either physical neglect or where the affordable restrictions are about to expire. We have been clear on prior calls of our steadfast opposition to rent control and other short-sighted policies that do not help solve the affordable housing shortage. Economists consistently say that rent control, in fact, leads to disinvestment in existing housing and impedes the creation of new housing. We support solution-focused investment like this fund that preserve or create affordable housing and favor the elimination of overly restrictive zoning codes that limit housing production where it's needed most. Along with ongoing engagement with public officials in our markets, this investment demonstrates our commitment to being part of the solution with respect to the affordable housing gap. To sum up, we are encouraged by the progress being made on vaccinations as well as the reopening of cities. Recent announcements made by employers, particularly in the tech industry regarding return to office are welcome news. We believe that the new operating model for most companies will be a hybrid of in-office and work from home and that our portfolio will benefit from workers looking to live close to the office. The unique cultural and entertainment options that are becoming available again, as cities reopen, are also magnets to our affluent renter demographic, and will draw them back to the cities and to the lifestyle, many of them crave. Our customer base has stayed well employed during the pandemic and can afford our current rents and absorb future rent increases as market conditions improve. 2021 is indeed turning out to be a year of recovery for our company. As we have said before, equity residential same-store revenue growth coming out of recessions has typically recovered quickly with us posting strong numbers, and I see no reason that will not occur again once the lagging impact of concessions and some of the other factors I mentioned abate. All of this is, of course, premised on continuing progress in controlling the virus and an assumption that other economic conditions remain supportive. Before I turn the call over to Michael, I want to thank all of our investors for their continued support during these challenging times. We are well positioned to benefit from a return to normal as the pandemic subsides. We are optimistic about the future of our business and believe that our portfolio will thrive. I'll now turn the call over to Michael Manelis. Michael? Michael Manelis : Thanks, Mark. So with the first quarter now in the books and our spring leasing season ramping up, we continue to see strong performance build upon the early indicators we were seeing on our last call. The accelerated distribution of the vaccines have clearly had an impact on many of the states and cities where we operate as they push for return to a more normal environment. Our teams in our various markets are sharing positive news of neighborhoods that are starting to feel alive again as more and more companies get ready to reopen offices. Regardless of the ultimate outcome of work-from-home, we see our demographic is drawn to the amazing culture, food and art that our urban locations offer. They're excited about reopening of these experiences and feel a sense of urgency to return, especially knowing that these lower rents won't last for long. As you may remember from prior calls, we have focused our approach on maximizing revenues by balancing occupancy with rate and concessions, which has proved successful thus far. Our confidence in the recoveries of our cities, coupled with this disciplined approach, kept us from overreacting in one direction or the other and we are well positioned as the recovery takes off to sell our excess inventory at net effective rates that are currently 14% higher than the end of last year. In both the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key performance metrics. Let me highlight a few of the overall trends. So first, demand. Demand was strong through both the winter season and early spring with a continued trend of increased applications and move-in activity that is well above seasonal norms and has fueled a stronger-than-expected occupancy recovery. Occupancy is currently 96%. And as of two weeks ago, is now above the prior year comp period. And for the first time, beginning to approach 2019 levels. This occupancy strength is contributing to the improvement in our revenue growth recovery. Pricing trend, which includes the impact of concessions and is a good indicator of where market rents are headed, has improved across all markets during the first quarter and through April. We continue to test price sensitivity in every market by raising rates and reducing both the value and quantity of concessions being granted. In January, concessions averaged just under six weeks on about 1/3 of our applications. By March and into April, this has been reduced to about 20% of applications receiving on average four weeks, and we expect this to continue to decline into May. As stated in the management presentation, we have seen a 14% improvement in pricing trend from December 31 to April 23. Renewal rate negotiation pressure continues as we renew residents who signed leases at the onset of the pandemic before the declines and pricing trends occurred. Outside of Southern California and Denver, our other markets have pricing trend below prior year, which put pressure on renewal negotiations. This situation is improving weekly. And as Mark mentioned, we expect the other markets, excluding New York and San Francisco, to be positive by the end of May. April renewal rate achieved should be 200 basis points better than March, which was a negative 4.5%. The percent of residents renewing also continues to improve, with March and April, both achieving above 55%. These levels remain below our historical average for this time of year, but the gap is closing. Blended rates, which combines new lease changes and renewal rates achieved continue to improve with sequential improvement in new lease change expected for the next several quarters. As previously discussed, renewal rate achieved was pressured in Q1, but the pressure will continue to moderate as pricing trend improves and as the rate on expiring leases which were written pre and early onset in the pandemic narrows with current market rents. On pages six through eight of our management presentation, we have provided color on pricing trends, physical occupancy, percent of residents renewing and leasing concessions for each market. So I will not repeat that here. But let me provide some brief market-specific commentary. I will start in Boston, where we are seeing an uptick in interest from students as many colleges have announced plans for campuses to open again in the fall. We may well benefit from limits on dorm occupancies as some students will need to find alternative housing. This market will face some headwinds from new supply, particularly in the city, where we are still dealing with some non-stabilized lease-ups from last year as well as a few new deals expected to deliver in the back half of 2021. New York is starting to see positive momentum. Demand is good, driven by both bargain hunters looking to upgrade and people returning to Manhattan in anticipation of office reopenings. Specifics around office re-openings remain unclear, but indications are that it will be a hybrid that has employees back in the office, at least part of the week by summer and early fall. In New York, concessions remain part of the marketing strategy, even while we are raising rates. This market held on to widespread concession use through most of the first quarter, but the last several weeks has shown concession use starting to decline. Unlike any of our other markets, New York has a more significant number of local operators not on yield management, who tend to use concessions more frequently. New supply is basically nonexistent in Manhattan, however, supply pressure on the Hudson Waterfront in New Jersey in the back half of this year may impact that submarket. Our migration data suggests that this market is beginning to return to normal as applications from outside the New York MSA and move-outs leaving the MSA, both continue to trend closer to normal pre-pandemic levels. Turning to D.C. During the pandemic, physical occupancy held up better in D.C. than any of our other East Coast markets. Absorption of new supply also has generally remained healthy that has slowed compared to 2019 levels. While demand in this market remains robust, we are facing some headwinds from new supply in 2021. D.C. has an excellent track record of absorbing new supply, but with more than 12,000 units being delivered this year, that track record will be challenged. Heading to the West Coast. Seattle trends are moving in the right direction, but the market has shown periods of price resistance. Tech companies continue to hire and are moving towards reopening offices. Amazon's recent announcement of its commitment to an office centric culture as their baseline is a very good sign for driving demand. The expiration of the H1B visa ban at the end of March should also be a good driver of demand as the tech sector was heavily reliant on this program for talent. On the supply front, new supply deliveries will rebound in 2021 with the largest concentration in the CBD down town submarket. San Francisco, one of the markets hardest hit by the pandemic is clearly on the road to recovery. Concession use in this market has shown a meaningful decline. Our communities located in the city of San Francisco are starting to feel vibrant again. Late in the first quarter, we saw a flurry of announcements from Bay Area tech firms with regards to return to office. Many of the tech firms, including Google, are taking a firmer than expected stance with regards to office attendance, as they recognize the importance of in-person work in both product creation and company culture. Schools are reopening with colleges planning for students to return to campus in the fall, and demand for our two and three bedrooms has clearly increased in the last several weeks. New supply will be elevated in 2021 with a large concentration in the South Bay, which may create some pricing headwinds for us. Southern California has been the strongest part of our portfolio during the pandemic. Los Angeles, despite being one of the most lockdown cities in the country, continues to have good demand. The city is opening back up, and the governor has set mid-June for a full reopening. The most encouraging sign in this market is the pickup in activity in the content creation sector. Television and movies that were filming in other states during the pandemic are returning to LA. 2021 new supply deliveries will be well spread out across the submarkets, with most of the expected pressure coming to us in the Mid-Wilshire, Koreatown submarket. Orange County and San Diego continue to be the real standouts in terms of performance. These markets have the highest occupancies and the best, albeit still negative, revenue performance. But we see same-store revenue growth in these markets turning positive in the second quarter. These markets should continue to benefit as the state opens back up, and travel and leisure activity picks up. New supply will be at normal levels and generally well spread out across the submarkets. While Southern California is generally one of our better performing areas, it has and continues to experience the highest levels of delinquency. We have mobilized our teams to assist our residents in applying for available federal rental assistance dollars, while California was ahead of most states in creating a rental assistant application process. The state is just beginning to process applications and to send out money. We will be aggressive in pursuing these California relief funds as well as other programs throughout the country. Finally, in Denver, demand remained strong across the market, although pricing pressure and widespread concession use is common downtown. Our two suburban Denver properties have little concession use and are seeing good demand and revenue growth, new supply will be elevated from 2020 levels, but good job growth should be a driver of the absorption of that supply. Across all of our markets, our focus will remain on increasing rates and continuing to reduce and eliminate concessions, our strategy of not chasing occupancy at any cost during the winter is paying off. So far, we have been able to grow our occupancy, while at the same time, recovering just over 60% of the decline in rate that we experienced from March to December of 2020. We believe that this approach will continue to benefit us as we move forward through 2021 and close that gap. Let me close by thanking the entire equity residential team for their continued dedication and hard work. I am confident that we have the best team in the industry, and they are demonstrating the power of working together as they lead the markets through the recovery phase and remain relentless in serving our customers and taking care of each other. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question today from Nick Joseph with Citi. Nick Joseph : I appreciate all the additional operating disclosure. As you look at the pricing trends in the management presentation, and they're approaching last year's growth, at least in April. So then you look at blended rate in April, still down 7.2%. How do you marry those two things together? I know you talked some on the renewals. But how would you expect signed new leases to trend over the next few months? Michael Manelis : Nick, this is Michael. So I think the way to think about this is pricing trend from Page five in that management presentation is the leading indicator of where the improvement is going to come to blended rate. And then after you see the improvement in blended rate, you start to see the improvement in revenue growth. So I think there's probably about a month or two lag that you start to see as we'll start to cross over. Now remember, the comp period from last year gets easier as we work our way through May and June. So our focus is really around that pre-pandemic period, which is what were rents like in each one of these assets at the very beginning of March 2020, and where we have good acceleration, we're focused on what was that high mark from '19 and how fast can we go after that. So I think as we keep pushing forward and keep getting that momentum over prior year, you'll start to see that blended rate improvement really kick into gear. You could see what happened just sequentially from March to April. I would expect you're going to see that same kind of real big pop as you work your way, April into May. Nick Joseph : That's very helpful. And then, Mark, you mentioned the considerable amount of activity. I was just wondering if you can give more details on that expected external growth and the size and cadence of the deal? Mark Parrell : Nick, well, just to be clear, the growth is really a swap, right? We're selling assets, as I mentioned in my remarks, predominantly in California, but also elsewhere. Getting really terrific pricing on that stuff and being able to trade into properties in Denver, for example, where we're going to expand our presence, we think, pretty significantly over the next few quarters. We continue to look at some new markets. And then again, suburban parts of our existing markets. So again, we'll have better detail. I actually have properties to speak to, but we're well along in that process. I expect to have a bunch close in the next month or two, and then to be able to talk about it in more detail in July. Nick Joseph : Thanks. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Next we'll hear from John Pawlowski with Green Street. John Pawlowski : Thanks. Maybe a follow-up on that, Mark. We'll wait a few months to hear about actual deals. But just in terms of the private market pricing you're seeing evolve in these markets, which metropolitan areas do you think been the cheapest right now in terms of going in pricing? And which markets do you think pricing is the most irrational? Mark Parrell : Great question. So I'm going to look at cap rates, talk a little bit about cap rates with you, though we all know that's only part of the picture. A lot of these markets, almost all of them that we're either in or interested in with the exception of Manhattan, Brooklyn and call it, the city of San Francisco are trading at or higher than they did at the pandemic period. So we were looking at cap rates, for example, in Denver, 3.75% to 4.25%. I mean there isn't a market that's screening cheap. And in terms of expensive, I'd say the recovery is well-priced in. It's probably a charitable way to say it. I think these cap rates are low because people have confidence because even in the Sun Belt markets or places like Denver, there were declines in revenue. And I think what people are seeing is you're going to make that up, and you're going to make that up pretty quickly. And so they're willing to kind of capitalize that into the price. So with the NOI is still relatively low, that makes the cap rates low. So I guess I'd say there aren't any bargains we see. But what works for us is if we can sell some of these assets that whether it's locational or we have an over-concentration. We're able to get rid of, John, at pretty low cap rates, too at values in a lot of cases that are the highest, not just the pandemic, but we've ever seen and buy assets we really like at the same cap rates, even if they are, frankly, in the very low fours and in the threes, that's still a good trade for us. We still think that gives us that diversification we talk about, maybe a little better growth going forward. Again, we're always looking at newer assets, so we're not arbitraging new properties for old. We're typically buying in our markets. And in Denver, for example, assets that are 2016 vintage or newer. John Pawlowski : Okay. Understood. Makes sense. Final question, maybe when you stare out -- either for Mark or Michael, when you stare out a few years beyond this initial snapback in rate and occupancy in your markets, which markets do you think are well positioned for kind of a nice multiyear run in rent growth? And which markets are you concerned, kind of hit a wall compared to how - these next few years? Mark Parrell : Well, let me start there. Michael may have something to add in there, John. But maybe we'll talk about the whole company for a second, and then we'll go to the market's question because we have been noodling on that a little. We're certainly not in a position to give '22 or '23 guidance. But I think when you look at how this company performed, Equity Residential perform coming out of recessions and thinking back to the tech bust in the 2002 vintage period and great financial crisis in '09. You've had a couple of years of negative growth. And then you've had kind of an in-between year, a transition year where we were right at zero for same-store revenue. And then you've had that snapback that you're referring to, where we're averaging 5% for three or more years of same-store revenue growth. What I think is different this time or is likely to be, first off, the decline was much larger. Absolutely. Both last year and this year, larger than the order of magnitude in those two prior cases. But I think we're going to skip the transition year and go straight, given the velocity, Michael is speaking of. We're going to go straight to a number that's considerably higher than that sort of transitional zero to de minimis same-store revenue growth. When you look by market, one market I was thinking a bit about before the call was New York. And we certainly hear a lot about New York and that kicked around a little bit. But when you look at the numbers after the great financial crisis, they had a couple of years. They had quarters where the numbers were 7% quarter-over-quarter. And I'd remind everyone that simply removing concessions is an 8% increase for a given lease in revenue year-over-year. So I think New York will put up some pretty good numbers, but in fairness, that's based on some pretty big declines. And I think the same is true for San Francisco. I think we've got a lot of confidence in Southern California. I think that market is doing very well. I think Seattle has been a little uneven. So I'll let Michael maybe comment on that. A lot of confidence in Boston, the recovery has been great in that market. There's a lot of good things happening in Boston. And again, in D.C., and we haven't talked about it in a while, but we're still going to have Amazon's HQ2 coming, and that's very close to numerous of our assets. So I feel like when I look at the markets, San Francisco and New York might post very significant quarter-over-quarter year-over-year numbers. But in fairness, that has to be judged by the level of decline that occurred the last few years. But when you just do compound numbers, I think Southern Cal is going to feel good. I think Boston is going to have a really nice recovery and come out of this more quickly than any place else. And I guess I'll defer to you, Michael, as you think about Seattle, because I just don't know how to think about that? Michael Manelis : Yes. Well, so I think near term, I think I said in the prepared remarks, it's had these moments of kind of fits and stops as our recovery goes. But if I would go a little bit further out, longer term, I mean, the demand drivers are strong in all of our markets. So as you really think about our ability to kind of grow revenue across our markets, all of these markets have unique aspects of what's going to be really delivering that demand growth. And I feel positive about really our opportunity as we work our way forward. We've still got this near-term stuff. We've got to work our way through, but the momentum is on our side right now. Mark Parrell : Just - and I'm sorry to supplement further, maybe just a conversation about Denver, and this is just as applicable to Austin. I mean, a lot of the per square foot rents in those markets are $2 to $2.20 a foot per month. When you look at other markets that we think Denver will emulate like Seattle, there's a lot of room to run. I mean -- and when you look at single-family, and I was just out there with our Chief Investment Officer a few weeks ago in Denver, great quality of life, a lot of good things to say about job quality and lifestyle in Denver, but also single-family has gotten a lot more expensive. I mean, townhouse is that routinely are $600,000, nice homes but not elaborate. And again, our rents at that level compete well. And I feel like you could see some real out-performance for higher-end apartments in places like Denver and presumably places like Austin, the issue is that the market is pricing that in. And that cap rates are pretty darn low. But again, if we're trading out of assets we don't want, and it's at the same cap rate, and we're buying a better kind of growth stream, we think that math is going to work out for us. John Pawlowski : Thanks for all the comments and for the time. Mark Parrell : Thanks, John. Operator : We'll now hear from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Rich Hightower : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks again for all the\u2026 Mark Parrell : Good morning. Rich Hightower : Operational detail, good morning. So just to think about the charts in the investor deck from last night, New York and San Francisco. And as we think about sort of the interplay between occupancy and net effective rents. And Michael, I think you touched on this a little bit in your prepared comments. But is there a chance or is something you're forecasting where maybe rents level off a little bit as you play more catch up in occupancy in those markets specifically over the next few months? Michael Manelis : Well, I think I would say that the occupancy is catching up and that trajectory moves. Our focus really in both of those markets is to continue to claw back as much of this decline as we can, given the strength and demand we're seeing. We still got ways to go. If you isolate like Downtown, San Francisco to the nine properties or 2,500 units we have. We're still materially off from where we were at this time last year. The good news in that market is concessions have really abated. So now we have an opportunity just to grow that face rent. The opposite opportunity exists in New York right now, whereas concessions held down strong, and now our focus is let's keep trying to pull back those concessions. Even while concessions maintain that high level in the first quarter, we were trying to pressure test just raising up rate. So we have this a different opportunity in both of these markets to really go forward. So I wouldn't say it's -- let's pause occupancy and claw back all the rate or let's keep rates where they are and get all the occupancy. It's this constant push on both levers. Rich Hightower : Okay. That makes sense. And then just in terms of the sort of the return to office wave, obviously, that's a big contributor to demand, whether that's happening now or maybe later this summer, it's causing demand to increase in a lot of the sort of the urban core submarkets. Are there any trends that we can -- or that you're gleaning from your portfolio in terms of who's moving in and whether that's by price point or unit mix or maybe the different neighborhoods? Are there any kind of interesting takeaways from some of those data? Mark Parrell : Sure. Well, I will tell you, I think on the past calls, I talked about the pressure we were having with studios and just not seeing a lot of demand for new leases there. That clearly is changing as we work our way through that first quarter and through April, just sequentially, from our point of April 23 to the end of that first quarter. We've improved 150 basis points in our occupancy of studios. So we're not back all the way where we were, but we're clearly starting to see that demand. And that's really an interesting standpoint because we're not seeing as much of the acceleration in the rate recovery on studios yet. So you're still seeing that attractive price point and that leads to that next demographic piece just from the overall affordability and like the household income. So what we've done is we're really focused right now in new residents that moved in with us during the first quarter. What do we know about them? So first, from the overall age profile and demographic, really pretty much in line with our historical average. Those move-ins had 33 -- they were 33 years old. It's a little bit less in like in New York market where we were 33.5. But historically, we were up in like a 35-year old, kind of moving in. So not a big change on the age. On the affordability index, which is really rent as a percent of income, we really saw no significant change across any of our markets. The portfolio is still averaging at 19%. So rent as a percent of income is 19%. When you drill into that because rates are still down, that means what gave is a little bit of a decline in the annual household income for our new residents moving in. It's just not a significant number, though. These are still affluent renters that are moving in with us. The most significant decline came in New York. But our average renters for Q1 household income was $215,000 in that market, and their rent to income ratio is still at 18.5%. So we've been kind of watching these demographic trends to see what's happening. The pattern of going after the larger units, the one and two bedrooms, we talked about on the last call, still there. We're well occupied on that front. Now the opportunity is studios. Rich Hightower : Okay, great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Next we'll hear from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Jeff Spector : Thank you. Good morning. One follow-up on that - the last discussion around demographics. Specifically, New York City and San Francisco, can you discuss a little bit more on who's returning, who's entering the portfolio? Any color on that to give us? Mark Parrell : Sure. So I think by that, we'll just -- we'll talk about what we say is like our migration patterns. So like where are people coming to us from the new residents as well as when we look where are our residents that are leaving going. And I will tell you in San Francisco, we're trending back towards normal pre-pandemic levels, but applications from within the same MSA and state, both still remain elevated. Huge improvement sequentially from what we saw in the Q3 and Q4 period of last year, but they're both still slightly elevated, which really just means that you're still seeing kind of this deal seeker or people trying to take advantage of it just moving within the market. The New York front has really almost returned back to normal. It still has some elevated level of deal seekers from within the same MSA. But really, that is materially lower. We were up in like 80% of all of our applications in New York were coming to us from within the same MSA. Right now, we're back down to 65%, which is right in line with our historical norms. Jeff Spector : Thank you. Very interesting. And then second, on renewal rates, I know you made comments on markets outside San Fran and New York. It should return positive by May. I'm sorry if I missed this, but can you provide a forecast for San Fran and New York? When do you expect renewal rates to stabilize or also turn positive? Michael Manelis : That's a great question. So I think a lot still depends upon our ability to grow that pricing trend over the prior year and really back to that pre-pandemic level. So I would think I would look at this somewhere in -- we have an opportunity in the late second quarter, early third quarter to do it if that momentum stays. But I could also just see that number kind of moving out a few more months. If we kind of hit any section of pause in our ability to keep recovering and clawing back that rate. Jeff Spector : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler has our next question. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey. Guys, good morning. Two questions. First, Mark, as you were talking about the sort of the markets or sort of the change in the demographics of people moving in. Is your view simply that based on the commentary of the income levels that you're seeing? I'm really talking about San Francisco and New York because it sounds like the other markets are doing much better. Is your view that if you remove the concessions that the new renter profile can afford the standard face rents? Or is your view that it's going to be a slow trickle of easing back into the historic face rents that, let's say, we were at in 2019? Michael Manelis : Well, I mean, I think from an affordability index, it's clear that the new residents moving in are going to be able to afford increases as we return to those pre-pandemic levels. As we've been pulling back even sequentially into April and as we think about where we sit today, even from last weeks, kind of applications coming in, we're pushing really hard, and we're not finding that resistance point yet. I mean, that's our goal, is to keep pushing and trying to find that resistance point. We haven't seen a change in the demographic profile. So I think from an affordability standpoint, the applicants coming in, they're all approved based on the gross rent. So regardless of concessions, they're approved on that gross rent and they're used to paying us that gross rent after they get past that first or second month. So I think that's something we'll have to watch in the markets where we -- like New York and San Fran, where we really kind of have momentum to dial back even more on that concession use. But to date, for the month of April, we have not seen any material change in that demographic. Alexander Goldfarb : So if I understood you correctly, all the tenants are approved based on their ability to pay the non-concessionary rent, the full-face rent, is that correct? Michael Manelis : That is correct. That is correct. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. That's actually pretty big. So it's on the total rent, not the effective rent. Okay. It's interesting. Mark, it wouldn't be a conference call without rent control discussion. I see that Albany is still kicking around a good cause eviction potential for basically rent control in New York. You didn't mention it in the light of asset of markets that you would sell down. But given that New Jersey and Connecticut are -- don't seem to be in that same vein, would you have a view of selling down your New York and Manhattan exposure and increasing New Jersey and Connecticut? Mark Parrell : So you're going to ruin all the news for next quarter, but we did sell our last asset in Connecticut, and that was really an asset decision. It just wasn't a property that we thought had the renovation potential that the buyer did. So it's just a little bit of an older property, Alex. We are interested in a deal and will likely close shortly that is a New Jersey higher end affluent renter base. You can certainly commute into Manhattan, but there's a lot of folks that live at this property that are going to work in that area. So we are open. Again, New York has -- the New York metro has some huge advantages in terms of supply dynamics, in terms of having the largest base of high income rentership in the country by a long shot. I think you can say whatever we all might say about this President and the prior President's actions. But as it relates to infrastructure, and spending and things that the city of New York, the state of New York and the states around it needed. A lot of money is coming into these states to heal, so we're still open very much to investing in the greater metro area in New York. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. But it sounds like you may be open to further selling down your direct New York exposure. Is that fair to say? Mark Parrell : That's fair to say. We have 27 buildings in Brooklyn and Manhattan. I can't tell you how many we'll have in two years, but it will be somewhat less. And I think that we've got some of that 421a stuff, you might remember that we've spoken of, that's just hard for public reporting company to own. And I just think we're probably just a little over concentrated in Manhattan. And you may just see a slight net. But again, you'll see us find deals that we like in the metro area, and we'll buy those. We got a development deal in the New York metro area as well that we'll talk about next quarter or the quarter after. So I think we're willing to do both, Alex. But this trend of spreading out our capital is true in every market, and that definitely includes New York. And I think New York net will be smaller than metro. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Cool. Thank you, Mark. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Appreciate, Alex. Operator : We'll now hear from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Rich Hill : Hey. Good morning, guys. I want to go back to maybe comment or question Nick was talking about at the beginning. And thank you very much for the additional disclosures. I recognize Marty might feel differently about putting it together, but we certainly enjoy it. As you think about pricing trends, the slide on Page five talks about all of your markets. I'm struck by how all Orange County and San Diego have done well above pre-COVID markets. Denver is starting up fairly well. So as you think about the ability to push before return to work, let's use New York as an example, it seems like given the demand that you're seeing from people optimistically moving back to major markets like New York City, there's still healthy room for you to push that. Is that the right way to think about it? Michael Manelis : Yes, absolutely. You could just look at the slope. I mean, I would say we have been pushing. If you just look at the slope of the line, that's occurred. But our goal is to keep being as aggressive as we can, while we have that demand kind of coming in that front door. Rich Hill : Got it. And so as we think about these pricing trends, given the NOI contribution coming from markets like New York, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, you could actually see those -- that pricing trend go well above where it was this time last year for a variety of different reasons, but primarily due to mix. Is that a right way to think about how that pricing trend might look like in 2Q or 3Q, assume that you put this slide in your deck again? Mark Parrell : Well, it's Mark. I just want to make sure we're answering the right question for you. When you start comparing price trend, for example, in July of 2020 in any of those markets, the pricing trend in July of '21. Because '20 kept going down in '21, we believe and hope and feel is going to keep going up, those numbers will cross and relatively soon. So we're trying to be careful. We're certainly happy that we're improving, and we see that as an absolute. But pretty soon, it won't be relevant to judge us against 2020 anymore. It's when do we get back to pre-pandemic 2019, early, early 2020, and we're making progress towards that. So to answer your question, yes, that will probably happen and those lines will cross. That's partly because we do feel like we can keep pushing pricing trend, that's partly because it went down so hard in 2020 in fairness. But I think you're going to see us talk more and more if things keep going this well about how and when we'll get back to late 2019, early, early 2020 type of pricing. Is that helpful? Rich Hill : That's absolutely helpful. And that leads me to my next question, if I can, which is the forward outlook. Obviously, the market wasn't weak in 2019 prior to COVID. But is there a scenario where you can actually really begin to push rents pretty heavily. Once you normalize back to 2019 levels, given a combination of strength that you're seeing in the already strong markets. But also on millennial and Z generation, that should create a heavy demand in urban markets? Mark Parrell : We certainly hope so. I mean, you're starting to ask a question that's more applicable probably to 2022. But again, we've all read the articles. Yes. We all read the -- I mean the setup is good. You got great occupancy. I mean, New York, in just a few weeks, will open up to 75% occupancy in office space. And we're seeing these numbers so strong. And legally, it's not open for more than 50% occupancy, that feels terrific to us. And again, we've all read about what happened after the 2019 or whatever it was Spanish-flu epidemic. There was a lot of pent-up demand for all sorts of things. And I think we'll see that. I think people want a little more space. Young people have been stuck at home with their parents. My kids included, one out, and they want to live where we own properties. And I think we're going to feel all of that, which is your Gen-Z comment. So I think we've got a good long runway here ahead of us as we get through this year, put the pain of 2020 behind us as a company and as a society. I think you're going to see some pretty good numbers from folks like us, apartment owners in these big cities. Rich Hill : Yes. Thanks, guys. I was indeed asking a question about '22. I'm just trying to think about once we get -- once we get back the inflection in the second half of '21 and the first half of '22, which feels very real to us. What do we look like going forward. But that's quite helpful guys. Mark Parrell : Well, that was shifty of you. But I mean, I'd just tell you, obviously, progress in the pandemic has to continue. Like I said in my remarks, economic conditions have remain generally supportive, but there's good momentum. The single-family market is very expensive still. I do understand all the return to office, work remote arguments, but I think there's still a very large constituency happy to live in our urban locations. Rich Hill : Thanks, guys. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Good morning. Question on concessions. So in New York, you mentioned that 55% did not receive a concession and 45% got six weeks on average. What's the difference between the haves and have not? Is that a neighborhood discrepancy or price point? Michael Manelis : Well, I think it's a little bit of both. So clearly, we have some markets like the Upper-West side and Upper-East side, where we really have pulled back using concessions. You still have submarkets like Chelsea and Gramercy that you still see concessions are being used widespread across most of the applications. So I think at this point, we've seen momentum in the last three weeks, even in those tougher hit areas. So we're going to just keep opening. We could keep pulling back and dialing back not only the value of the concession. But just how frequently they are. The other thing you got to remember with the use of concessions is many times, what we're doing right now is we'll have concessions in place on vacant units to create the sense of urgency to fill our vacancy, and we will not offer concessions on noticed units, which is residents that said they're moving out somewhere at the end of May or into June. We'll advertise those units for sale, but we will not have concessions on them, and we are leasing those units without concessions. John Kim : Okay. And then how long do you think it will take to reduce the concessions back to pre-pandemic levels? Is it going to be more likely more than one lease cycle? Michael Manelis : I think that's too early to tell, right? You could see the momentum in like a San Francisco, Downtown San Francisco, how fast you can pull back? So I think New York, or the Manhattan submarkets clearly have the opportunity to just pull back at the same pace. They haven't done that yet. And I think a lot of that does have to do with the type of ownership we have. Where you have a lot of kind of single-owned assets that aren't using yield management, and they're going to keep those specials in place until they fill back up, and then they'll eliminate the concession. So I think that's still TBD as to when we'll get back to a place where we're normalized on the concession use in that market. John Kim : Okay. And then, Mark, you mentioned that the portfolio repositioning this year will have minimal impact to earnings this year. But do you see this new market concentration providing more earnings growth potential? Or is the benefit really diversification and stability going forward? Mark Parrell : A little bit of both. When you think about growth, as I said in some of my prior answers, it's likely that New York and San Francisco will post absolute numbers that are somewhat higher in the near term, let's call it, so maybe '22, '23-ish periods. Just again, because the decline, John, was so significant before, I think when you start to talk about a longer period of time, it's probably good to have a little bit of a -- to be in a few of these growth markets and be a little bit spread out. So -- and I also just think diversification of all sorts is good. I mean, listen, we've talked a lot about political risk in some of our markets, but I'd point out, if you own departments in Texas, you probably have some pretty significant casualty and maintenance issues to deal with from the freeze. So there is no place that's riskless from physical point of view or riskless from political issues or whatever. So just having the capital in us being in 6, seven markets, it's probably better to 10 or 11, but I don't see us going back to 30 like we were in the late '90s. That's not -- that's too many to keep, I think, good track of and to be on top of. John Kim : Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Amanda Sweitzer with Baird has our next question. Amanda Sweitzer : Thanks. Good morning. Can you guys provide an update on your ancillary income trends? And do you have pricing power to implement some of those fees today? And any thought to bring in more short-term rentals? Michael Manelis : So the short-term rentals, I would say, at this point, we're not doing that. We see enough demand for conventional renters. So we're going to kind of hold off on going back to that type of renter. And as far as the ancillary income, I think we're still being aggressive where we can with all of our amenity fees, whether that's raising the parking. I mean, we spend a lot of time over the course of the last couple of years, improving kind of how we priced our parking spaces and how we kind of optimize the revenue from that. So I think there's still a little bit of opportunity left, but not a lot there. And then the other thing that feeds into some of those ancillary incomes is just our settlement fee. So when people break leases, what are the fees we charged. We clearly have increased those throughout the COVID period, we'll keep them at this elevated level. And then the other areas that we have right now, I would say we had some things in place pre-COVID that we're just not ready to go back to yet. Amanda Sweitzer : That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, have you given any thought to re-purposing some of your existing commercial space? And if you have -- I mean, what uses a pure interest and any prospective ROIs on those conversions? Mark Parrell : Yes. Amanda, it's Mark. So we have given some thought. We've talked on prior calls a little bit about that. So again, this would mostly be for our current residents. Our thought isn't to compete with those sort of rework type remote work providers. It's more to provide an amenity to our residents that they're either paying for directly on a per use basis, maybe it's repurposed ground floor retail that we put a great Internet hub in and some furniture and then off to the races or maybe it's just space and existing amenities that we're bifurcating a little bit more so people can use it. So I don't really have an ROI for you as much as its stickiness. And I'll say that one thing we don't want to do is just hold on an empty retail for too long, assuming we can get cities to let us rezone it. We do have retail space that was vacated, and we're just giving a lot of thoughtfulness to whether we're just going to put new retail tenants in that space. And then you haven't forbid 2, 3, four years later, go through the same experience again. Because retail is a tough business. We're glad we have very little of it. So we may repurpose some of that additional space as potentially amenity space for our residents. But you shouldn't expect us to use it significantly as an independent rental stream. Amanda Sweitzer : Makes sense. Appreciate the time. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : We'll now hear from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Haendel St. Juste: Its Haendel. Thank you. Good morning. So I was curious, maybe you guys can talk a bit about the outlook for bad debt in the portfolio given the recent extension of the Eviction Moratorium? And how that plays into your same-store revenue picture for your California and overall portfolio? And what's reflected in the guide? Robert Garechana : Yes. No problem, Haendel, it's Bob. So from a bad debt perspective, not a lot has changed. And you kind of saw that in the reported numbers from -- sequentially from Q4 to Q1. They're relatively flat. And that's what we assumed in our guidance is that they kind of stay the same. We do not assume any kind of material level of improvement. That's, obviously, a potential green shoot. We are very active in the process of working with our residents as it relates to some of these federal rental assistance programs. And that's particularly concentrated, as you kind of alluded to in Southern California, where we have experienced the most elevated amount of bad debt. And so that's a possibility, but is not incorporated into the numbers themselves. So for now, our best guess is just assuming that things stay the same throughout 2021. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. And maybe, I guess, can you talk a bit about, if your funding thoughts for potential acquisitions has changed at all, given the continued improvement of your cost of equity. I know that the plan this year was to be -- to use proceeds from dispositions to buy. But just curious say if there's been any shift in thinking about perhaps being more of a net acquirer given the improvement of cost of capital? And then also as part of that, maybe you could talk about your plan to get bigger in Denver and Austin, if development will play a role in that in your overall income development here? Mark Parrell : Well, it's Mark. Thanks for that question, Haendel. Those are a little bit linked because the one thing we can't do with recycling is development. So if the 1031 rule's continue to be in effect, it's pretty efficient for us because we do have assets we want to exit in markets where we want to lower exposure to do -- use a -- do a tax-free exchange and then just move the money over. I would say on development, that's an area where in the past, we have used the ATM or have used other mechanisms to raise money because you can't 1031 into developments. You really need to have independent capital. Often, it's been pretty small. So we've used debt capital. But again, as our cost of equity improves here and as our -- it becomes a more relevant funding source, I'm open to it. Another way, by the way, to address our market concentration, our desire to rebalance is to make the whole company bigger. So you could use, again, ATMs and issuances to buy assets and not recycle. But as long as the 1031 -- and buy assets, I'm sorry, in new markets or in Denver, for example. But that's a process that could have more dilution associated with it. So I just want to be kind of thoughtful about it. Haendel St. Juste: That is helpful. And one question, one last one for me. Maybe you can help me understand something a bit better. The commentary about reinvesting your -- well, potentially disposition proceeds from California into places like Denver, but accretively on an IRR basis. I'm just struggling to reconcile the math here a bit. If cap rates in Denver and California are both in the, call it, low 4%, maybe sub 4% range. But rents across much of California is still sitting below - well below prior levels, while Denver is already looks like it's past it. I guess I understand the lower CapEx, certainly, but how the IRR -- is that different or even better in a place like Denver with cap rates already pretty low. So maybe you could help me understand what I might be missing here as you think about the reallocation of capital from California to a place like Denver? Thanks. Mark Parrell : I think you're asking a very fair question. I think you're starting at about the same place as you suggested. I think the assets we're selling often do have significant capital that needs to be invested. And I appreciate that's more of an AFFO thing than an FFO thing. But as you know, we think a lot about CapEx at EQR. And so in a lot of these cases, we're buying new product in Denver, and we're selling old product in California. And so I think the shareholders are much better off on an AFFO basis. I'll also say, again, when we're in Denver, looking at $2 to $2.20 a foot rents per month in a place where incomes are rising very quickly. And we got a lot of momentum. That to me, as compared to $3.50, $4 rents in California, it makes me feel like, boy, why couldn't that number very quickly get to Seattle's number in the higher 2s and low 3s? Why can't that happen over an accelerated period of time? So we're not underwriting crazy numbers in Denver, but we are underwriting significant same-store -- significant rent growth in the first few years and then some sort of normalization. But I feel like I've got likely more upside in places like that for the reasons I just mentioned. And we already have tons of California exposure. So if California does draft up, as you said, even better, great. We already have -- we'll always have 40% of the company in that state. But maybe we don't need to have 45-plus percent in that state. Is that helpful? Haendel St. Juste: That is. That is certainly, it sounds like, obviously, that there's a CapEx element in your comments about AFFO but just curious, as we look back over the prior decade, and we've seen cap rate compression between the coastal and non-coastal. Years ago, it used to be 50, 75 basis points, a few years back, maybe 25, 50. Today, we're sitting here right on top of each other. I guess I'm curious, where you think cap rates in place like Denver are 3, five years from now versus today, comparatively to, say, New York or California? Mark Parrell : We got to start by knowing what interest rates are, what growth is -- I mean, I -- boy, I wish I was that good. That's the big corona question. Yes. I mean -- and by the way, do I have to know the answer for sure, if I'm spread out in places where there's knowledge workers, good general economic growth. I mean if we spread our bets a little bit, and we'll draft that no matter where it happens, right? And again, to be over concentrated in any one place, probably -- that's probably a lesson we've all learned. Even before the pandemic wasn't a great idea. And it isn't just, again, these coastal markets. Florida, every time hurricane season comes, we have no properties there, but we used to, I remember. Shuttering every time it started because I didn't know what it was going to do to our numbers into the condition of our properties. So I mean, every market has significant risk of 1, there's no riskless apartment market. So to be more balanced, I think, is a good idea in any regard. Haendel St. Juste: Much appreciated. Thank you for the time. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Brad Heffern : Good morning, everyone. A question on office conversion. So we've heard some reports in the press that some major metros you're thinking about converting offices into apartments potentially or potentially just typical housing. Do you see that as something that's likely to happen? And could it potentially have any sort of meaningful impact on supply maybe that we wouldn't see in typical supply numbers? Mark Parrell : Yes. Well, first off, anything that helps the affordable housing shortage is worth trying. So we'll start with that premise. Because, again, some of the conversations or articles I've read and you've likely read are about, can that help with affordable housing. I'm not sure, but let's give it a world because that's a real issue. But we -- the problem with converting offices, often, these are older office buildings, large floor plates, limited windows. So when you think about a lot of units that don't have outside access that don't have windows, I think Michael would tell you, those are going to be card units to rent. We do have a couple of buildings in the portfolio that were repurposed. One is a great asset that used to be the U.S. Steel headquarters down there the New York Stock Exchange on Broadway. That's a great asset that's really cool. It's also a pretty narrow asset. Everyone has window access and the property works. We have some out-West as well. Same thing, floor plate is a little bit smaller. There's an interior courtyard. I don't know what happens with a building that takes up half a block or more. And you're just trying to turn it all into apartments. I'm not sure how that's going to work. So I'm not that concerned with it as competitive to higher-end apartments. And I think we'd be open to trying to figure out a way to make it into affordable units. But again, this window issue is not a small one. Most people want to see the outdoors. I mean that's -- again, I think Mike will be very unhappy if we gave them hundreds of units to rent without windows. Brad Heffern : Yes. Okay. I think we can all agree with the windows. I guess a question on the guidance, yes. I was curious why the top end of the AFFO guide stayed the same just given that all the underlying -- or most of the underlying contributors moved up at the high end. Is there something that's maybe that you guys don't guide to that's depressing the top end of the range? Or maybe is there some conservatism built in, just given we're so early in the year? Robert Garechana : There's certainly no -- there's nothing that depresses the high end of the range, et cetera. So there's nothing in that regards from a guidance perspective. The only thing I would tell you from the ranges and the shifting of the ranges that you have to keep in perspective is where we started from. And that range, that initial NFFO range that we gave at the beginning of the year was very wide, right? So with a $0.20 difference. So it was probably abnormally wide relative to typical years in other time frames. But I wouldn't read anything into we shifted up the guidance range on revenue, on NOI and then we paired off the bottom end of the NFFO range, but I won't read anything of not raising the top end, if I'm answering your question. Mark Parrell : Yes. I mean it's still kind of a math. Yes, it's kind of a math equation. Robert Garechana : Yes. Mark Parrell : I mean it's - there's $0.05 more of FFO likely to come from operations. So you move the midpoint up a $0.05 to $2.75, and you didn't need the rest of the range. So it was kind of what happened. Brad Heffern : Yes, okay. Got it. Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Upal Rana with UBS has our next question. Upal Rana : Hi. This is Upal in place for Brian. Could you give us some color on how much the impact on the extreme residential housing environment has on your business? And are you making decisions as far as rents or potential acquisition or dispositions given what's going on? Or are you taking a wait-and-see approach? Thank you. Mark Parrell : Pardon me, I didn't quite understand that question. Are you asking what extreme are you referring to? Upal Rana : Just the low inventory in housing and some of the higher prices. How is that really affecting your business? Mark Parrell : Great. So you're referring to single family housing. I'm sorry, we took that to mean apartments. The whole portfolio is designed not to have a lot of impact given the markets we're in from single family. So the fact that single-family prices are going up and availability is tight, that's somewhat helpful, I guess, to our business, but it's not as helpful as if we had a portfolio in a market where everyone wanted to be a homeowner right away. You think about markets like a Kansas City or something where people just -- they really living in an apartment is a transitional state for people with middle incomes, and they want to own a home right away, and there is a much purpose to being a renter as much advantage in terms of amenities in the city center. That's, in our case, our residents are thinking a lot about lifestyle and job proximity and other stuff. So single-family issues are really not terribly relevant to us right now. Upal Rana : Okay. Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Next we are from Alex Kalmus with Zelman & Associates. Alex Kalmus : Hi. Thank you for taking the question. So I appreciate the favorable new move in trends and concession environment, how you're peeling off some of those. But I'm just curious how the brokerage commission component plays into your leasing strategy going forward? I saw you offer 20% so just curious. Michael Manelis : If yes. So for us, I mean, the use of brokers is really heavily concentrated in New York. And right now, I'll tell you, in the first quarter, we were just over, I think, $300,000 in broker fees. And it is truly directed towards the submarkets where we are still having the most pressure. So Gramercy, few assets in the Gramercy submarket and Chelsea submarket is where we will have kind of advertisements where we're willing to pay that broker fees. But you could see that $300,000 a quarter. My guess is as the market continues to improve, that our dependency on that brokerage in those submarkets will lessen. Alex Kalmus : Got it. Thank you very much. And sort of touching on the renewals, maybe in a different way. What occupancy level would you feel comfortable at in your New York and San Francisco markets to sort of get to a more flat renewal rate? Is there any sort of benchmark that you'd look towards? Michael Manelis : Well, no, because, I mean, we're quoting our renewal offers in line with where that future streak is expected. So as we think about pricing trend, that effective pricing trend, as soon as it starts crossing over prior year in any asset or any submarket, those renewal quotes will go out with an increase. And then we'll just -- we'll start having the conversations with residents, but so much of our ability to focus on achieved renewal rate increase is dependent upon what is happening in that direct submarket around us? What are other options when that renewal offer comes in? And as concession use starts to abate, that power and the negotiation shifts back to the landlord. Alex Kalmus : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our final question today will come from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : Thank. So in terms of the concessions, can you just remind us in the guidance what that assumes in terms of -- I know you're going to continue to have this straight-line issue with the concessions. But from a cash standpoint, what are you assuming for concessions to the back half of the year. I know you give the monthly numbers, they've been declining. Do they continue to decline sequentially from here, they go to zero? How should we think about that relative to the guidance? Robert Garechana : Yes. So thanks, Nick, for the question. So our concessions, our assumption and guidance from -- and I'm going to talk from a cash basis, and then I'll talk -- mention a little bit the amortization. But is that we continue to see the good momentum that Michael has kind of outlined, and we continue to see the reductions that we mentioned, for instance, between like March and April. So we continue to think on a cash basis that they will decline. Because of the GAAP treatment and the straight-line amortization, in fact, we think that the cash numbers are going to flip soon such that the cash numbers are better than the GAAP numbers, meaning you're amortizing more concessions than you're actually granting on new ones. So you saw in the first quarter, the GAAP number was better than the reported cash number. I think that's going to flip, and that's what's encompassed in our guidance, if that makes sense. But it's a continued decline as we work through the recovery, and we're already seeing that well on the way, as Michael outlined. Nick Yulico : Okay. That's very helpful. Just one other question on the concession activity is, if you look at -- I know we keep talking about New York, San Francisco, but these are markets where you did see concession activity coming down. At the same time, you're still 100, 200 basis points below prior to COVID occupancy. And so I guess I'm wondering why if you're going into the higher turnover season over the next second quarter, third quarter? Why if you're still below on occupancy than sort of long-term goals? Why would you be pulling back concessions in the market? Michael Manelis : Yes. So I guess I would tell you, you need to really drill in and understand the assets that we're competing against. And what is the occupancy of that submarket that we're operating in. Because when we're looking at this, we're always trying to stay, call it, 100, 200 basis points above what we would say is market occupancy. But when -- right now, when you're in this recovery phase, the overall market occupancy is not as relevant as drilling into the assets that you're competing against and what are those occupancies. So I think this balancing Act of clearly in these more hard-hit areas, like the New York and San Francisco, is to really focus on recovering everything. Grab your occupancy and keep pushing aggressively on rate and dialing back concessions. San Francisco responded well on the pullback of concessions. New York was a little bit more resistant. And a lot of that has to do with the type of ownership that exists there. Mark Parrell : Yes. And Nick, it's Mark. Just to add a little bit to that, mean our ownership in New York City, so Brooklyn and Manhattan as well as in the city of San Francisco, which is where all this action is really happening. That's about 10% of the company. And so it's a small group of assets. As Michael said, we're very capable of doing both. I mean we intend to raise both rate, diminish concessions and drive occupancy. But there may be buildings where we just can't move concessions. And Michael, but we've got great demand, but we just have that demand is super price sensitive. Then you'll see us just grow occupancy. But for the most part, now, we're in a better position. That demand we talked about in the fall, led to the occupancy improvements over the winter is leading to the pricing improvements now. And shortly, we hope will lead to the other abatement of concessions, though that's not in our guidance. We think concessions exist all the way through the fourth quarter, just a lot lower. But there's sort of this cycle we're in that I think is a very positive one. Nick Yulico : Okay. Appreciate that, Mark. Thanks, everyone. Mark Parrell : Thanks, Nick. Operator : And we do have a question from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Rich Anderson : Thanks. Sorry, forgive me on, but that\u2019s why they pay the big bucks. So I do have a question about the tail, perhaps a longer tail to this recovery. Like as long as I covered multifamily, you go through the spring and summer leasing season when that's over, you kind of the years in the bag, so to speak, you start thinking about the next year. This time, the Magic Day seems like Labor Day, schools perhaps reopen, offices reopening, you have a different dynamic in terms of economic activity that could extend the activity level within your business. Do you see that as a potential outcome from this? Since it's so different than any other environment, we've seen that the ability to kind of extend your heavy leasing season could actually fall into the fall months because of those dynamics? Michael Manelis : Absolutely. I absolutely could see that playing out. We also have -- we had great traction in Q3 and Q4 of '20. So from a rent roll perspective, I will have more renewal activity kind of in that back half of the year. It's not a material shift, but it is a shift. So I really do think this demand profile and what we used to think of as a normal kind of peak leasing season is going to extend out and go into kind of the later part of Q3. And it could very well. We've seen other recovery cycles continue all the way through and push through the fourth quarter as well. Mark Parrell : Yes. Just to give you some real-world evidence. We know you're a student of history like we are but the fourth quarter in 2011 for our New York portfolio, same-store revenue growth, again, fourth quarter 2011 was 7.4%, and the first quarter of 2012 was 7.1%. I'm not promising numbers like that. I'm just telling you that when a market is in a recovery, it can perform like that. And our expectation is there will be a very fulsome recovery in New York City and in San Francisco over the next few years. So we agree with you. Rich Anderson : Great. Thanks very much. Mark Parrell : Thanks a lot. Operator : And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Parrell for any additional or closing remarks. Mark Parrell : We thank everyone for their interest in Equity Residential and wish you a good day. Thank you. Operator : That will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Equity Residential Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. Now, at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Martin McKenna. Please go ahead. Martin McKenna : Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential\u2019s second quarter 2021 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer; Alec Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer is here with us as well for the Q&A. Our earnings release as well as a management presentation regarding our results and outlook are posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Thanks, Marty, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Today, I will give some brief remarks on our operating trajectory and investment activity. Then Michael Manelis will follow with some top level commentary on the current state of our operations and how we see the remainder of the year playing out, followed by Bob Garechana adding color on our guidance changes and balance sheet. And then we\u2019ll take your questions. Also, as Marty mentioned, we are pleased to have Alec Brackenridge, EQR\u2019s Chief Investment Officer available during the Q&A period. For those of you who do not know Alec, he\u2019s a 28-year veteran of this company. He literally started work here the day we went public in 1993 and took over as our CIO in 2020. As you can see from the release, he and his team have done exceptional work of late on the transaction side. Turning to operations. All of our operating metrics continue to improve at a faster rate than we assumed earlier in the year. We\u2019re seeing demand levels well above 2019 in all our markets. And this has allowed us to continue growing occupancy while at the same time raising rates. This resulted in the company materially raising annual same-store revenue, NOI and normalized FFO guidance. While our quarter-over-quarter same-store revenue and NOI results remained negative. The decline was less than what we expected and our sequential same-store revenue and NOI showed positive growth for the first time since the pandemic began. As we have discussed on prior calls improvement are reported quarter-over-quarter same-store numbers will lag the recovery in our operating fundamentals, as we work these now higher rents and lower concessions through our rent roll. We believe that our business is set up for an extended period of higher than trend growth beginning in 2022, as we recapture revenue loss due to the pandemic and continue to benefit from strong demand and growing incomes in our target demographic. Also the more diverse portfolio we are creating should improve long-term returns and dampen volatility going forward. On the investment side, we\u2019re active buyers and sellers in the second quarter and expect to continue being active capital recyclers. Consistent with what I\u2019ve said on prior calls, we are allocating capital to places that are attractive to our affluent renter base, including the suburbs of our established coastal markets, as well as Denver and our two new markets of Austin and Atlanta. We are making these trades with no dilution, even given higher pricing levels for the properties we are targeting, because we\u2019re able to sell our older and less desirable properties at low cap rates and at prices that exceed our pre-pandemic value estimates. Earlier this month, we re-entered the Texas market after an 11-year absence by acquiring two well located new assets in Austin, Texas. These properties are located in a desirable area with high housing costs. That is equidistant between downtown Austin and the domain hub on the North side. We acquired these two properties for $96 million and approximately 3.9% cap rate and about $195,000 per unit. We expect to acquire a mix of urban and suburban assets in the Austin market. During the second quarter, and in July, we acquired two properties in Atlanta, Skyhouse South in Midtown for $115 million at a 3.6% cap rate. This is a deal we did previously disclose. And a few days ago, we acquired a second property in Atlanta and the Bustling Midtown west neighborhood. We acquired this new property for $135 million, and it is about half occupied. And once it completes lease-up, we expect it will stabilize at 4.1% cap rate. We also continued adding our Denver presence by purchasing an asset in the suburban Central Park area of Denver for $95 million. This property is located just west of the large and growing Fitzsimons medical campus and draws residents attracted to its access to abundant outdoor amenities. We expect this property, which is also in lease up currently to stabilize at a 4.2% cap rate. We\u2019re also pleased to add to the portfolio of property each in the suburbs of Boston and Washington, D.C. The Boston property is located in Burlington, Massachusetts, and is a new asset that we acquired for $134.5 million at a 4.1% cap rate. This property is in a difficult to build suburb of Boston with high single family housing costs and good access to high paying jobs. The DC asset is located in Fairfax, Virginia, and is a 2016 asset that we acquired for $70 million at a 4.3% cap rate. This property is well located with both good highway and good metro access and proximity to growing job base in Northern Virginia. Both the Burlington and Fairfax assets are located in sub markets or our existing assets have performed particularly well. Year-to-date, we have bought $645 million of properties and expect to close on another $850 million in acquisitions. A good number of which are in various states of advanced negotiation by the end of the year. We\u2019ll fund these buys with an approximately equivalent amount of dispositions, mostly from California of older and less desirable assets, which we sold or under contract to sell at significantly above our pre-pandemic estimate of value. Turning to development. We put into service and began leasing our newly developed property in Alameda Island, a short ferry ride to the city of San Francisco, built on the site of a former naval base. This property has terrific views of the skyline and an evolving restaurant and bar scene that we think is attractive to our clientele. Over the next few months, we will complete our other two current development projects, including the Alcott in Central Boston, the largest development project in the company\u2019s history, early leasing efforts on this project and our development project in Bethesda, Maryland are going well. And our current estimates are that these three projects will stabilize at a development yield of approximately 5%, considerably higher than prevailing acquisition cap rates. These properties will be meaningful contributors to NFFO starting in late 2022. We see development as a good compliment to our acquisition activities, as we spread more of our footprint to the suburbs of our established markets, as well as to our new markets. We expect a significant amount of our development activity going forward to be done through joint venture arrangements. This allows us to leverage our partners in place sourcing and entitlement teams in locations like our new markets, where we do not currently have a development presence. Before I turn the call over to Michael, a big thank you to my colleagues in our offices and properties across the country. You are doing an exceptional job during this particularly busy leasing season. And we\u2019re all very proud and grateful. Go ahead, Michael. Michael Manelis : Thanks, Mark. As evidenced by our revised guidance, the pace of recovery has been very strong. In both the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key performance metrics. Let me highlight a few of the overall trends. So first, we continue to see very good demand for our apartment homes. Our national call center and Ella, our AI leasing agent are responding to record high levels of inbound interest for our apartments, which is converting into high volumes of self guided tours. This overall level of demand continues to drive applications and moving activity that is exceeding move out and ultimately is delivering stronger than expected recovery and occupancy. Portfolio wide, physical occupancy is currently 96.5%, which is back to 2019 levels. San Francisco and Seattle are still trending slightly below 2019 and Southern California markets are slightly above. At this point, we expect to run the portfolio above 96% through the remainder of the third quarter. This strength and occupancy is allowing us to push rate and drive revenue growth. Overall, we are more than halfway through the typical peak leasing season and the momentum has been very strong providing us the opportunity to raise rates, reduce concessions, and grow occupancy. These fundamentals are delivering RV recovery from March to December of 2020 pricing trend, which includes the impact of concessions declined approximately $500 per unit. From January 2021 to today, pricing trend has grown $660 and is now not only above prior year levels in all markets, but every market except for San Francisco is also above 2019 peak pricing trend levels. Today, the portfolio is approximately $100 higher per unit than our peak 2019 levels. Our priority has been to test price sensitivity in every market by raising rates and reducing both the value and quantity of concessions being granted. At the end of the first quarter, about 20% of applications were receiving on average four weeks in concessions. As of July, we are now running with less than 3% of our applications receiving on average just over two weeks. And we expect this to continue to drop off even further. To give you perspective, the total dollar of concessions granted peaked in the month of February at just north of $6 million for the same-store portfolio. For July, we will be at $1.5 million for the month and August should be less than $750,000. Last week, only 12 properties had any concessions being offered. The percent of residents renewing has stabilized around 55%, which is very much in line with historical averages, but below the record high 60% levels that we had in 2019 and early 2020. As you saw in the press release achieved renewal increase, new lease change and blended rate all continued to improve in July and we expect further improvements through the balance of the year as the comp period becomes more favorable and the business continues to strengthen. As we progress through the remainder of the year, our focus will continue to be to push rates in our markets and manage our renewal negotiations. In our management presentation, we provided color on all of our markets, but I wanted to take a minute to highlight New York and San Francisco, as they tend to be the markets we received the most questions about. Both markets are recovering nicely with concession use nearly non-existent in our New York portfolio and declining rapidly in San Francisco. New York is seeing stronger demand right now, and we think it is primarily due to greater clarity around employer returned to office plans. New York employers, particularly the banks and financial firms have called their employees back to the office and you could feel it in the economic activity in many areas of Manhattan. We see it in our portfolio after nine consecutive weeks of record application volume. In San Francisco, however, the return to office and reopening is a little more ambiguous. Employers have been slower to call employees back in with many initially targeting after Labor Day. Adding to the uncertainty in San Francisco is the reintroduction of strong recommendations for indoor masking and some delays in reopening, which were announced last week. The situation in San Francisco is likely to lead to a delayed leasing season in that market and a slower full recovery of occupancy. That said, occupancy is 95.4% today in San Francisco and is growing as is pricing trends. At this pace, we expect the San Francisco pricing trend to be back to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the third quarter. Meanwhile, we are seeing some indicators that we could see an extended leasing season with a second wave of demand in New York, Boston and Seattle. Our leasing teams in these markets have been dealing with prospects that are looking for moving dates in late August and September and hearing from them that these moves are in connection with their need to be back in the office or in the case of Boston back on campus. This demand is more robust than historical patterns, which could suggest an extended peak leasing season in those markets and matches up nicely with our lease expirations, which are more weighted towards the back of the year than usual. Combining all of the data points I\u2019ve just shared and those included in the management presentation, we see an unprecedented opportunity to grow sequential revenue over the next several quarters as the impact of better rates, nearly non-existing concessions and higher occupancy compound. We acknowledge how badly our operations declined over the last 16 months, but the current recovery appears to be strong enough to both quickly recapture all that was lost in the pandemic and take us into a new period of strong operating fundamentals. Finally, I want to take a minute and give you an update on the government assistance program for renters. As we\u2019ve discussed on previous calls, approximately $50 billion in rental assistance for those impacted financially by the pandemic was made available in the various relief bills. We are laser focused on accessing the rental relief funds and are working very closely with our eligible residents to apply for this relief. Processing to-date has been relatively slow in our markets, but we were able to recover approximately $5 million in the quarter. Bob will provide some color on our expectations for collections for the remainder of 2021 in his remarks. Let me close by thanking the entire equity residential team for their continued dedication and hard work. This pace of recovery would not be possible without them and they remain relentless and taking care of each other and serving our customers. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Bob. Bob Garechana : Thanks, Michael. This morning, I\u2019ll cover the changes in 2021 guidance that were included in last night\u2019s release along with a couple of quick comments on the balance sheet in capital markets. As Michael just discussed, the recovery is well underway and is exceeding our prior expectations for the same store portfolio. The continued strong operating momentum from this leasing season has led us to raise our annual same-store revenue guidance from negative 6% to negative 8% to negative 4% to negative 5%, and improvement at the midpoint of 250 basis points. Strong expense controls and favorable real estate tax outcomes, which I will talk about in a moment also allowed us to reduced our same-store expense guidance range to an increase of 2.75% to 3.25%, resulting in an NOI range of negative 7.5% to negative 8.5%, which is a 400 basis point improvement at the midpoint relative to our prior guidance. Drivers of our revenue guidance increase of 250 basis points are roughly 150 basis points of improving operating fundamentals that Michael just outlined, 60 basis points or $15 million for the full year and related lower bad debt, primarily due to anticipated rental assistance collections and the remaining 40 basis points is due to improved performance in our non-residential business. Before I move on to expenses, a quick comment on our bad debt assumptions. The back half of the year has about $10 million of additional assumed rental assistance collections, on top of the $5 million we\u2019ve already received. We feel very confident about this amount, because we either received it in July or after some real digging can see that it is far along in the approval process. There are other resident accounts being worked on, but they\u2019re not as far along, given the lack of transparency and the relative slow processing speed to date, it is difficult to handicap how much will successfully get processed and whether we will receive these funds in 2021 or it\u2019ll spill over into 2022. On the expense side, we have also seen improvements versus prior expectations, which led us to center the midpoint of expense guidance at 3%, which was the low end of our prior guidance range. This reduction is in part due to the modest growth experience in Q2 2021, even with a really challenging comparable period from Q2 of 2020. While some expense categories experienced atypically high percentage growth change quarter-over-quarter due to this compatibility issue, overall expenses were less than originally anticipated. Key categories driving the current period and anticipated full year lower were real estate taxes and payroll. Reduction in growth expectations for real estate taxes is primarily driven by lower than forecasted assessed values in some key markets. Lower payroll growth expectations are primarily driven by our progress and optimizing staffing utilization as well as higher than usual staffing vacancies. We expect that 2021 will be our third consecutive year of low payroll growth, having delivered a three-year average below 1%, while keeping other controllable expenses like repairs and maintenance in check. As a result of these same-store guidance changes, we raise the midpoint of our normalized FFO from $2.75 to $2.90. A couple closing comments on the balance sheet in debt capital markets. With the impact of the pandemic on our operations increasingly in the rear view mirror, it is clear that our balance sheet has held up remarkably well. Despite, unprecedented pressure on operations, our credit metrics have remained well within our stated net debt to EBITDA leverage policy of between 5.5 times to 6.5 times. The debt capital markets are also incredibly attractive at the moment for issuers like us. This creates opportunities to term out commercial paper with treasuries and credit spreads at or near record lows. The potential of which has been incorporated into our revised guidance range. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will begin with Nick Joseph with Citi. Nick Joseph : Thanks. Maybe we start on the rental assistance. Bob, appreciate all the comments in terms of what was recovered in the second quarter and what\u2019s assumed and understand the kind of desire to be conservative. But can you frame kind of the total opportunity of collecting any of the back rent through these programs? Bob Garechana : Yes. Thanks, Nick. So if you look at our disclosure in terms of our total receivables, the gross amount of receivables on the books in the same-store portfolio is about $44 million, right. So that\u2019s \u2013 and it\u2019s almost entirely reserved again. So that\u2019s really the total pie of possibility if you think about it. When you break it down kind of more granularly, we always run with $10 million, $11 million worth of receivable or bad debt. So it\u2019s probably a number that\u2019s a little bit below that. And again, so that leaves probably another five to 10 potential long run. The really hard part, as I kind of mentioned in my remarks is, just the frequency and the process associated with this. So it\u2019s a pretty long process. Michael\u2019s teams all over it, we\u2019ve gotten the best transparency we could, but it does require both the resident and us to match information to get it run through the process. And then it takes a while to even after approved have the cash kind of come through the door and that\u2019s where the volatility arises in the numbers, which we wanted to highlight and be really clear about given what we have in guidance. Nick Joseph : Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just on the expansion markets, as you look at the pipeline today and you look at kind of transaction volume broadly across multifamily, particularly in these markets. How quickly do you expect to get to scale? And I guess Austin and Atlanta and continue to ramp up in Denver. Mark Parrell : Hey, thanks for that, Nick. It\u2019s Mark. And I\u2019m going to answer a little bit, and then I\u2019m going to kick it over to Alec Brackenridge, our CIO, who is on the call. So when we look at the expansion markets, we would suggest to you, they\u2019ll probably be one or two more expansion markets, probably more news to come on that in future quarters. Some of those markets, Atlanta is a particularly large market, Austin is a smaller market, so there\u2019s different volumes there. So I\u2019m going to kick it over to him to talk a little bit about how long it takes to kind of create a portfolio that makes sense in those markets. But I want to point out to you that it depends also on the saleability, we\u2019re able to continue to sell properties well, that\u2019ll fuel the engine to buy property as well. So it depends both on transaction volume in those new markets that Alec will speak to and our ability to continue to dispose as we very successfully done the date of properties at good prices in places like California, New York and DC, where we\u2019re trying to lighten the load a bit. Alec Brackenridge : Yes, following up on that, this is Alec. Atlanta is a really robust transactions market and we have great contacts there from the past, I\u2019ve worked in that market for almost 25 years now. And whether it\u2019s joint venture development or acquisitions, there\u2019s a wide range of things we can choose among. And generally the properties that we\u2019re looking at a roughly $80 million to $100 million, and what we\u2019re shooting to do over the next few years is to get to about $2 billion. So 20-ish properties, and we think we can achieve that. Austin is a smaller city. So that would be more in the $1 billion range, 10-ish properties, 10 to 12, maybe. But again, we have good feelers. We have a great team that has a lot of experience in these markets and that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking to accomplish. Nick Joseph : Thank you. Operator : Now moving to our next question that will come from John Pawlowski with Green Street. John Pawlowski : Thanks a lot for the time. Maybe for Alec or Mark, I know you\u2019ve made the comments in the past, given where replacement costs are ground-up development doesn\u2019t pencil, particularly Manhattan, curious some more stable markets, Boston and DC. Do you think ground-up development pencils today? Mark Parrell : We do have some deals we\u2019re working on John. So thanks for that question. It\u2019s Mark. And we do think in some cases, it does. We\u2019ve got some deals in the Northeast, a couple that we\u2019re likely to start the next quarter or two, where on current rents, we\u2019re looking at yields around five and a little bit higher. We liked the locations. We have to constantly refresh the portfolio. So I would say right now with us feeling a little better about construction costs and we can get into that. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re not going up, but we have a better handle than maybe we did in the middle of the pandemic. Our sense is that some of this development is going to make some sense to us and that we are going to do some of it selectively. And it\u2019s really going to help, I think, get us exposure in some of the suburbs of these established markets and some of these new markets we\u2019re trying to enter into. John Pawlowski : Okay. And then last one from me on operations. Michael, given all the leading indicators you see today, do you think you\u2019ll have to ramp up concessions back up in any markets later this year. Michael Manelis : Based on what you see today, I would say, no, we do not. There\u2019s a couple of areas I will tell you, like, the South Bay and San Francisco, which I think I\u2019ve said on previous calls, just from the volume of new supply being introduced into that sub-market and the proximity to some of our properties. I could see a little bit of that pressure from the new supply, bringing concessions back to some of the stabilized assets in that sub-market. But I don\u2019t see us reversing trend right now, given the strength that demand that we see. It\u2019s really more, if the demand stays strong enough to aid the absorption of the supply, that\u2019s coming in the back half of the year. That would be the only thing that could kind of impact the concession use on stabilized assets. John Pawlowski : Okay. Thanks for the time. Michael Manelis : Thanks, John. Operator : Now we will take a question from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Rich Hightower : Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions here. I think as we think about guidance through the back half of the year, I\u2019m wondering, which markets sort of assume normal path of seasonality and which I think you mentioned a couple of which maybe aren\u2019t going to be on that normal seasonal path. And then how do we think about that set up for 2022? Do you expect all your markets to sort of resemble normal seasonal path in terms of market rents and so forth? Michael Manelis : Yes. So I think first for the balance of this year, I would look at the Southern California markets and say, they\u2019re probably kind of going to be more in line with normal seasonal trends. And again, a lot is going to depend on what that strength the demand is, if you have a second wave of demand coming into these markets that is going to change the profile through the fourth quarter. And you think about next year, we are doing some things now with some lease terms for the new leases we\u2019re writing, but, again, we saw about a 5% shift. So we \u2013 meaning, we have about a 5% more explorations in the back half of 2021 that we normally would have otherwise seen. My guess is over the course of 2022 that clearly starts to mitigate back towards a normal pattern. But again, the strength of the fourth quarter this year could put us in a situation where we\u2019ll have more explorations in the fourth quarter of next year as well. So I still think it\u2019s a little too early to tell, what \u2013 how fast you\u2019re going to get back to a normal profile in the portfolio. Rich Hightower : I guess, just to follow-up on, Michael, there\u2019s a lot of drivers of this sort of extraordinary demand going on right now, right. You\u2019ve got, two cohorts of college graduates filling the pipeline. You\u2019ve got people decoupling from mom and dad\u2019s basement and so forth. I mean, do you think that \u2013 does that set up a risk next year that there\u2019s going to be an air pocket relative to what\u2019s happening right now? Or do you think that\u2019s not a reasonable, maybe not an expectation, but a reasonable guess at what might be the case? Michael Manelis : I think when you look through our markets, we have such strong demand drivers and fundamentals, job growth, you have constrained housing. So I don\u2019t think this is like pulling future demand forward right now, what we\u2019re feeling. This is like our catch-up period. And then I think, again, a lot is going to depend around what does this second wave look like of demand coming to us in late Q3 and Q4? How strong is that? We\u2019ll play into kind of what we should expect for next year. Mark Parrell : And Rich, it\u2019s Mark. Just to build on that. I do think next year, if you recall, late in 2019 and very early in 2020, we were doing well. The industry and this company we\u2019re doing well, we had good solid demand, our own internal statistics, as well as all the stuff we read from the analyst firms we subscribed to. So as our residents have kept their jobs, they have good income growth. So we\u2019re going to have the ability we think to access that demand, access that income growth, and just kind of not just catch up, which seems like to some extent, absent a real reversal in the pandemic, a foregone conclusion that we will get back where we were. We think we\u2019re going to keep right on going. And we say that with confidence now, again, assuming conditions in the economy running generally supportive, because we saw that great demand in 2019 and 2020 before the pandemic. I think that demand is still there, job growth still good. And we see that our demographic keeps getting raises, keeps being in demand and the shift to technology into the kind of jobs that make up our resident base continues. So we have a lot of reasons that we feel like this thing will have this big catch up, and then it\u2019s just going to have this continuation to it. Rich Hightower : All right, great. Thanks for the comments, guys. Mark Parrell : Thanks, Rich. Operator : Next question will come from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Jeff Spector : Great, good morning. Along those lines or a similar question, I was going to ask, if you can point to maybe something in the past or thoughts on the extended leasing season in 2022, but in particular, do you think it\u2019s a good indicator for renewals? You mentioned, you\u2019re at 55%, but talk to your point, things were really strong pre-COVID at around 60%. I was just curious if you \u2013 what are your thoughts on extended leasing season and maybe in a positive way could lead towards higher renewals in 2022? Michael Manelis : Absolutely. I mean, as you keep seeing the strength and demand coming in and you look at the recovery in these markets, you have to assume that we will fall back to kind of that higher retention level, which was renewing 60% of our residents. Right now, we are going to have a little bit of noise as we think about the back half of this year and those residents that moved in with us with concessions, moved in the second half of last year, came in with concessions at low rates. That\u2019s going to put a little bit of pressure on us from a retention perspective in the back half of this year, but again, the strength of the front door or that demand coming in is strong enough to backfill kind of that pressure on the renewals right now. Jeff Spector : Thank you. And then just one question wanted to clarify dispositions, Mark, you specifically had mentioned California to confirm, are you thinking of selling similar older assets \u2013 lower growth assets in other parts of the country or just California. Alec Brackenridge : Hey, Jeff, this is Alec. Yes, we are considering another markets. We\u2019re selling in California right now because the bid is just so hot for it. But as that moves around the country and we think, markets like DC and New York with this improving fundamentals will also become harder investment markets and we\u2019ll list properties there. And we expect to move some property there. Jeff Spector : Great. Thank you. Operator : Now we\u2019ll move to a question from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : Thanks. Hi, everyone. In terms of the residents that are moving back into the portfolio in a couple markets, such as New York, San Francisco. Can you just give us a feel for what you\u2019re learning about those incoming renters? Did they used to be in the portfolio or are they younger. Anything sort of about the profile of the renters in those two cities would be helpful? Michael Manelis : Yes. So not a lot of change and I would expand beyond just those two cities in any of our markets, right. When you think about the demographics coming in, and by that, I\u2019m going to refer to not only the age of the new residents that moved in the quarter, but also the average household income for those residents. So during the second quarter, our average age for move-ins was 30 \u2013 just over 33 years old, slightly below the historical average for second quarters in previous years, that was at 34, but pretty much right in line. And when you think about the overall affordability index, I\u2019ve said on previous calls, our range of rent as a percent of income between all of our markets goes between 17% at the low to 23% at the high. And as a portfolio for the move-ins that occurred in the second quarter, we were just over 19%. And that is very much in line with the historical averages for this portfolio. So I think what you take away from that is our rents clearly have increased sequentially, but so have the average household incomes for the residents that have been moving in. So sequentially, we averaged at $152,000 was the average household income in the second quarter. That\u2019s up from just under $150,000 for move-ins in the first quarter. So you can kind of see that balancing out and New York and San Francisco really kind of just fall right in line with the statements I just said. Nick Yulico : Okay, great. Thanks. And then in terms of the moves into land to Austin, I know you talked some about this earlier about, creating scale. I guess I\u2019m just wondering if instead, there\u2019s any potential to do a larger portfolio transaction across the Sunbelt, maybe work with a developer or any sort of M&A potential that would be possible to kind of speed up some of that process, instead of buying individual assets in most Sunbelt markets. Mark Parrell : It\u2019s Mark. Thanks for the question, Nick. Alec and his team look at everything. So we\u2019re certainly open to portfolio transactions and indeed the Austin deals, we\u2019re a portfolio deal effectively. We\u2019re kind of bundled together. But again, when you start doing large scale transactions, you can end up competing against different groups of people. Some of the deals we\u2019ve done were off-market transactions, where we located them on our own. So we\u2019re very open to portfolio transactions. We\u2019re open for example, to OP unit, operating partnership unit deals, which often end up being larger deals as well. But we just haven\u2019t seen a lot of that offered. And a lot of the portfolios, we do see have some assets we like and a lot of assets we don\u2019t. So buying them one at a time gives us an advantage. And M&A is just a totally different conversation, requires a willing participant on the other side, often the payment of premiums and other things that can make the deal less economically useful, but still we underwrite that stuff too and think about it as well. Nick Yulico : Okay. Thanks, Mark. Mark Parrell : Thanks, Nick. Operator : Now we\u2019ll take a question from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Rich Anderson : Hey, thanks. Good morning. So when I think about all these building blocks of improving fundamentals that don\u2019t yet kind of matriculate to the bottom line, you still have negative same-store growth, of course. But if you were pre-pandemic sort of 3%-ish, 4% type NOI same-store growth and you\u2019re down 8%, in the midst of it now or in the tail end of it, hopefully. Mark talked about the bounce back opportunity. Is there any reason mathematically that we wouldn\u2019t be talking about a mirror image of that move? So in other words, something like in the range of 10 double-digit type of a bounce back in 2022. Maybe not sustainable, but that\u2019s the kind of \u2013 sort of correction that might happen. And then we go back to more normal way type of growth in the years afterwards. Is that a reasonable way to think about it? Mark Parrell : Hey, Rich, it\u2019s Mark. Thanks for the question. Bob may supplement or correct me as needed here. We\u2019re not going to give 2022 guidance, but I think your thought process, if conditions continue as Michael has described. The last two years we acknowledged 20 and this year 21 had been among the worst. There\u2019s a lot of reasons to believe 22 will be among the best years for EQF not the best and an exceptional year for same-store revenue growth and NOI. I think we\u2019ve got good discipline on the expense side. And so getting the double digits would require excellent expense controls as well. So we\u2019re not going to commit to a specific number, but the way the numbers just set themselves up is as these concessions go away, we report on a straight line basis. As we move rents up in a lot of cases beyond pre-pandemic numbers, the kind of math you\u2019re putting out there is certainly attainable. Rich Anderson : Okay, great. And then the second question is, left out of the discussion so far has been the delta variant and the uncertainties that still lie ahead and clearly California has taken some steps. [Indiscernible] being sort of socially similar to California LA and San Francisco. Do you have any concern about getting too far ahead of your skis and that there\u2019s more to come with all this and we\u2019re not quite through it and there could be a hiccup along the way. Is that a part of your line of thinking at all at this point? Michael Manelis : Yes. Rich, a very fair question. None of us here are experts. I\u2019m not an immunologist, but it seems to us that if the vaccines continue to provide protection to the vast, vast majority of people that are vaccinated. Then you\u2019re going to have a situation by protection, I mean, protection from serious illness or death. I think businesses are going to remain open. Cities are going to remain open. Things are \u2013 can continue to progress and our business will continue to improve. I\u2019m not as anxious about mask mandates, whether what the CDC did yesterday or some localities have done. I think to your point, we need to learn to manage this and live with this virus as much as we all were hoping it was just done and over, I think it\u2019s going to be part of our lives for an extended period of time. On the good side, we\u2019ve all sort of learned or many of us have learned how to live with it. And I think society will manage through it. I think if you do have widespread city closures, that could be a concern and would certainly be a derailer for us. I would say though, that as you think about the way we\u2019ve all learned about how lockdowns work, the mental health impact on people, the economic disarray that lockdowns close, these sort of city-wide shutdowns, the deferral of other needed medical procedures. There\u2019s a lot of good reasons, especially when you have a vaccine that 60% of the population over 16 is taken, at least one dose of that seems like a more thoughtful way to proceed along with masks to us. So we\u2019re not trying to whistle past the graveyard or otherwise ignore the Delta variant. It\u2019s just our sense that policymakers have different tools at their disposable \u2013 disposal, excuse me, in better knowledge than they did back in 2020. And that widespread lockdowns are not as likely as they were in the past. Rich Anderson : Thanks, Rich. Operator : Our next question will come from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Brad Heffern : Hey, everyone. Going back to the recoveries, I appreciate all the color on that. Was there any portion of that 15 million that was in the prior guide? And then additionally, is there any assumed improvement in the guide just from day-to-day collections in the second half? Michael Manelis : Yes. So the 15 million referring to the rental assistance that was added to the guidance. It was not in the prior guide. We had kind of telegraphed on the first quarter call and, and even back to original guidance that we had assumed that collections would remain the same and that the bad debt level would be the same. So the 15 million is incremental. We\u2019re also added to the guidance. It was not in the prior guide also assuming that the collection rate, the 97% stays the same. So the only real change we made to the guidance was adding the 15,000,005 of which we\u2019ve already received on the rental assistance side. Brad Heffern : Okay, great. And then on California, you talked about how aftermarket is. Can you just walk through maybe any rationale for why that would be, because obviously we all know about the regulatory risk and sort of the lagging recovery, in that market. And then is there sort of a minimum size that you think about California representing in the portfolio? Alec Brackenridge : Hey, Brad, it\u2019s Alec. California is such a big state that I can\u2019t say that all parts of California are high. San Francisco right now has not had trades, downtown San Francisco as an example. But we have a broad portfolio and we find particularly for value add opportunities, there\u2019s just a wide, wide better pool. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in, as we\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019re selling properties are typically 18, 20 years old, and that appeals to that value add group. Michael Manelis : And just to add a little bit and answer the rest of the question. We think about what percent California could be of equity residential a few years into the future. Again, we\u2019re in the Bay Area, we\u2019re in Los Angeles, we\u2019re in San Diego, we\u2019re in orange county, great people, great properties in those markets. I think what you\u2019re going to see is we\u2019re going to do a little building. We\u2019re going to do a little buying in those markets, but generally speaking will be a net seller and our 45% asset exposure will go down below 40. And some of that capital will be redistributed to these expansion markets. And whether we get to the mid-30s or whether it\u2019s the high thirties, we\u2019ll just have to see. But we do want to mitigate a little of this regulatory risk in California. We want to be thoughtful about balancing out the portfolio. 45% is a pretty high concentration in any one state. So we think that\u2019s sort of a thoughtful way to balance things out a bit. Brad Heffern : Okay. Thank you. Michael Manelis : Thank you, Operator : Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. We\u2019ll take the next question. Rich Hill : Hey guys. Thanks for the thanks for making the time. Hey I\u2019m looking at your charts and your presentation where you compare your various different markets. And obviously Orange County, San Diego and Denver are doing really well. I\u2019m wondering do \u2013 does that strike you as a leading indicator for San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, New York, where as people begin to move back rather than just moving out, we could see a sustainable shift higher and pricing trends. So long story, long question, but is the hot markets a leading indicator for some of the coastal markets that were weaker, but might have a sustain trajectory. Mark Parrell : So Rich, it\u2019s Mark to start. And Michael, may you or Alec correct or supplement, but Orange County and San Diego for us are almost entirely suburban portfolios. And Denver is a little more urban than suburban, but has a big suburban component as well. So those markets have just really not been as affected and continue to progress right on straight through 2019 numbers. We think the leading indicators on coastals, what\u2019s going on in New York. So with the city, not even all the way opened a few months ago, we started a strong recovery. Now that recovery is in full swing. You see that recovery in San Francisco, Michael and I were there a month ago. And all our buildings are 95% occupied. Concessions are nearly non-existent. And that\u2019s before the city, at the end of June, it had just reopened. And it wasn\u2019t very activated to be honest. And the office population wasn\u2019t that high. So I would say to you, there are leading indicators to us. So the coastal markets are the coastal markets. I mean, they are already recovering and doing very well. I think what you\u2019re going to see a year from now is that if things, again, continue to be supportive as the coastal markets will just keep going, like they were in late 2019, early 2020, and that the recovery from the pandemic is not the limit of the upside in those markets. Rich Hill : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Hey guys, maybe just a question on underwriting, not necessarily what you\u2019re underwriting, although I\u2019d love to hear it from you, but when you\u2019re selling a property, what do you think your buyers are underwriting? Because obviously buyers don\u2019t underwrite happening this quarter, next quarter, next year, they\u2019re taking a longer-term view. So as you think about the trends that, that buyers and sellers are underwriting in the current market, what does that look like in the out years? Alec Brackenridge : Well, Rich, this is Alec. I mean, buyers are optimists, right. I mean, that\u2019s why they\u2019re buying. And typically with a value add, they\u2019re pricing that in, but there\u2019s the only successful bidder right now is assuming a full recovery, or you\u2019re not going to be able to be the prevailing bid without doing that. And so that that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. And in terms of further out years, I really don\u2019t know per se each deal. I think everyone has their own view on long-term inflation, but what drives the cap rate in the short-term return are these either a value add, return or a return to pre-pandemic rents are plus on that. Rich Hill : Got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I think that\u2019s it for me guys. Congrats on the nice quarter. Mark Parrell : Thanks. Alec Brackenridge : Yes. Thanks, Rich. Operator : Next question will come from Alex Kalmus with Zelman & Associates. Alex Kalmus : Hi, thank you for taking the question. With the three properties in the pipeline expected to be completed this year. What are your expectations to replenishing the development pipeline at the end of the year? Mark Parrell : Yes. Thanks for the question, Alex. It\u2019s Mark. We expect to start three or four deals through the balance of the year, maybe $400 million to $500 million of \u2013 excuse me, construction cost to be incurred over the next few years on those. There\u2019s always some uncertainty. You just don\u2019t know if you get your GC lined up quite right. Couple of these deals are JVs. The deals are both in Denver, suburban and urban Denver, as well as in the Northeastern markets and suburban locations. So as we said, we will continue to invest in the suburbs of our established markets. And one of them is actually an urban deal in one of those markets. So we\u2019ll certainly go through the details with you next quarter, but we are looking to replenish the pipeline. And in fact, we\u2019re hopeful. There is \u2013 there was a question earlier in the call and I want to supplement the answer. I mean, right now there are most newer properties are going for some premium to replacement costs. So there is in our mind some reason to do more development, as long as you\u2019re thoughtful about what your construction costs are, your execution risks, how you\u2019re funding it. So I think you\u2019ll see us do a little bit more development. The deals I just mentioned, plus some other stuff we\u2019re working on in the near-term. Alex Kalmus : Got it. Thank you very much. And looking at the transaction market again when you\u2019re thinking about the acquisitions, how do the cap rates on a stabilized basis compared to what the trailing 12 months were and what kind of NOI growth are you sort of baking into those assumptions? Alec Brackenridge : Well, Alex, this is Alec. Very so much property by property. Some of the properties were hurt more by the pandemic. So there\u2019s more of a recovery there. Others not so much, some of them have been \u2013 because they\u2019re newer properties are coming out of lease up. So there\u2019s a burn off of concessions, that\u2019s going on. So it\u2019s hard to give a blanket statement, but we\u2019re certainly seeing far fewer concessions than any of our markets and expecting a return to the run rate of rental growth over time. Alex Kalmus : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Alec Brackenridge : Thank you. Operator : Amanda Sweitzer with Baird has a next question. Amanda Sweitzer : Thanks. Good morning. If you think about lease rate growth in the near-term, are there still areas where you\u2019re facing since COVID-related restrictions in terms of your ability to push those lease rates? And then if there are how significant are they and what\u2019s kind of the outlook for them rolling off. Mark Parrell : So yes, I mean, there are still several markets that we operate in that we are under restrictions on the ability to grow rate or grow the increase on renewals. I think that lessons as you get past the end of September, but there still will be some restrictions in place beyond that date. But I think we still, right now, we\u2019re looking at our opportunities as we get past that September to kind of keep pushing those rates in all of the markets that we\u2019re operating in. Amanda Sweitzer : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then following up on through your San Francisco comments on the transaction market specifically, do you think that 4, 4 cap rate your reported for the smaller asset you sold in the suburbs is indicative of market pricing? Or has there just not been enough volume to tell yet? Mark Parrell : Yes. There\u2019s not enough volume to tell. I mean, there\u2019s such a wide range in how properties are performing, that, that, there\u2019s not enough. I mean our expectation is that, cap rates will normalize there and lower over time. And there\u2019ll be a lot more bids since we\u2019re looking for. Amanda Sweitzer : Thank you. Appreciate the time. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Next question will come from John Kim, BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Thank you. On developments, Mark, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks doing more through joint venture arrangements. Can you provide some more color on what this may look like? Are you just a funding partner and you have the option to take it out, or do you see them being long-term partnerships? Mark Parrell : Yes. More of the former, more we\u2019re partnering with local or regional, or maybe even national developer who has an embedded existing infrastructure of a deal finders, entitlement experts in markets, particularly the suburbs where we have less of a presence. Our development focus of late has been doing our own wholly-owned deals in urban centers, but in the suburbs, our established markets and in some of these new markets. So it would be us sort of renting that expertise in exchange for a promote, the developer building the deal as being the capital and having the right to purchase the asset at the end. So it\u2019s not a merchant build program in a sense that we\u2019re certainly happy to make money, but we want to end up with the asset at the end and add it to the portfolio and kind of help us fill things out. John Kim : And so what would it be the yield differential between joint ventures and on balance sheet developments? Mark Parrell : Yes. That\u2019s a great question. We spent some time talking about that in some real life examples. So I\u2019m going to ballpark some of these numbers and would ask you to stick with me for a minute and Alec can sort of supplement that. But paying, promote does not have a terribly material impact on the yield, even in a fairly successful deal. So we thought about a deal where the unlevered IRR of the deal was something like 11% or 12%. And I believe it changed the acquisition yield for EQR from a 5.4% to a 5.2% cap rate of data. That\u2019s not 0, 20 basis points is real, but it \u2013 when you think about the fact that EQR doesn\u2019t have to carry all that overhead, it doesn\u2019t have good debt deal costs. Doesn\u2019t have failed deal costs and can be expert capital allocators. I mean, we all learned about some costs in business school, but it\u2019s still really hard to let go of a deal you\u2019ve worked on. When you\u2019re in our position as a capital allocator, not as only a developer, you\u2019re in a better position to pick and choose the opportunities that suit us best. Alec, you have anything? Alec Brackenridge : I would just add that the developers typically a really small part of the equity \u2013 overall equity, typically, 5% to 10%, we\u2019re 95% to 90%. So that\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t really change the return to us as much as you might think. John Kim : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. My second question is on renovation CapEx, which has been trending down over the last couple of years, which totally understandable. But now that your markets are fully recovered, when do you expect that to ramp up and give the ability to do so to increase rents? Mark Parrell : Yes. So we\u2019re looking at that all the time and we\u2019re pushing opportunities that we can, but I\u2019ll tell you, there are a lot of challenges right now just getting appliances and example, getting lumber as you\u2019ve heard, cabinets are hard. So the reasons why we\u2019re not picking up the pace outside of the immediate impact of the pandemic, which has abated in some of our markets, but our expectation is to increase that over the next 12 months. John Kim : Right. Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll now hear from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you. And good morning out there. So two questions, first, just going back to a few analysts ago, when you guys were talking about managing the heavy two to three months pre explorations this fall. Is it your view that you are going to bring basically all of those to market like forced turnover? Or is it your view that will be sort of split some you\u2019ll stair-step, some you\u2019ll first force turnover, just trying to understand how much of that given the strong market demand, you guys talk about, how much of that you think you\u2019ll be able to get this year versus having to wait until next year to get it? Mark Parrell : Yes. Hey, good morning. So a great question. And I\u2019ll tell you so far, we remain optimistic about the renewal performance for the remainder of the year. We just started in July and August to see the renewal quotes going out to folks that had previously come in with concession. So about 17% of our offers for July and August went out to those folks that received a concession. And so far the retention and ability to bring them up to market has played out. Now as we progress through September and into December, that number 17% grows to about 25% of our offers will be to individuals that came in on a concession. So the strong demand that we have right now is really driving the confidence and in our ability to backfill at current rates. So while we don\u2019t want to drive the additional vacancy, we\u2019re going to work with residents and potentially stair-step if the demand remains as strong as it is, we will bring everybody up to market, or we will have some increased turnover, because we can replace those units at higher rates in a very short order of time. So the other thing I just want to call out is, our residents are used to paying us that gross rent amount and the concessions that we granted were granted in usually the first or second full month of occupancy with that. So our challenge and our opportunity is really more around bringing them up to the gross street rent that you see today. And like I said, if the demand at the front door remains as strong as it is, we have a high degree of confidence because there are options to go elsewhere in that market are going to be very limited, because we\u2019re at market rates now. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. So basically you\u2019re saying that when you guys offer the whatever two months free, three months free, that was at the initial first month. And since then the people have been paying the full freight. Mark Parrell : That is correct. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Second question is, as you guys have returned to markets, like, I mean, you\u2019ve been back in Denver a while, but Austin, Atlanta, et cetera, when you compare now versus when you were previously in those markets, what would you say is your biggest sort of shock if you will, is it household income? Is it how the areas have built up lack of supply? Is it better product than what you used to own? I\u2019m just sort of curious how you compare when you guys left those markets to now, and what\u2019s been the most, the biggest change that you\u2019ve encountered, obviously that makes you excited to reenter, but I\u2019m just curious the biggest change that you\u2019ve noticed. Alec Brackenridge : Yes. So there are quite a few of those things in \u2013 Alexander, this is Alec. The change, but the primary thing that we look for in a new market is that renter, the knowledge-based industry renter, who\u2019s got a resilient job, growing income. And on that, that those numbers are up dramatically in Atlanta and certainly in Austin, but also in Denver. And that comes then with these much more vibrant urban settings that they\u2019re choosing to live in and kind of foster and be part of. And that\u2019s a big part of why, they stay in these neighborhoods longer than in the old days. And we had a lot \u2013 we had much lower rents. We had much more turnover and single family home prices were so much lower, particularly in the kind of neighborhoods that folks were living that already there was choosing to live in. So that was a big source of competition. Whereas today, in a market like Atlanta to find a affordable house, you have to go out really far. And a lot of people just don\u2019t want to make that trade off when they\u2019re been living in Midtown or Midtown West or Buckhead, they\u2019re enjoying the life that they have, and they\u2019re just less likely to move out. And that that\u2019s been a big change from where the way it was when we were there 10, 15 years ago. Mark Parrell : Yes. And that\u2019s a great question now. So I\u2019m just going to build on it. It\u2019s Mark. I mean, rents that we used to charge were a $1, $1.50 rents. And our situation when we exited those markets was our best renters could immediately afford to purchase a home. And our worst renters didn\u2019t pay us and left in the middle of the night. And it was a whole different demographic. And now this demographic is much more like a coastal demographic. They\u2019re well employed in financial technology, new media, other fields, they enjoy these urban amenities and these dense suburban amenities. They might want to buy a home, but home prices, we spent a lot of time on this in Atlanta because average prices in Atlanta for the metro aren\u2019t very high for homes. There were about the national average, but any areas near where the employment centers are people work and the neighborhoods that Alec mentioned they want to live, it is quite high. Atlanta has got a lot of traffic. So if you want to move, just like you can move in New York, you can move to you qualify, but it\u2019s a good distance where in before in Atlanta, it wasn\u2019t much of a distance. So again, we got a lot of our folks siphoned. So we\u2019re looking at rents in a $2 to $2.5 a foot in these areas, double what it was before a demographic that\u2019s got much higher incomes, single family situation that to us looks a lot better than it did when we left these markets a decade or a decade ago. And then again, that combines with the political risk that you and I and others have talked about on these calls for a long time. That\u2019s considerably more favorable than some of the other markets were. Alexander Goldfarb : So just to sum that up, would you guys look at the some income like you guys, which I think sort of the team at 23 year or 17 to 23 in general, are these markets where you see are now in the lower end of there, therefore you see more of an opportunity to push growth \u2013 or are those markets just more structurally the rental income levels are structurally lower versus the New York, et cetera. Mark Parrell : Yes. I missed a little of that question, but generally speaking, the rental income ratios are higher in the markets we\u2019re going into. We think that\u2019ll be offset a little bit by pretty good growth in incomes by those residents, because those areas are growing so much. I\u2019ll also say that some of the cost structures, like the fact that there\u2019s no tech taxes in Texas matter as well. So it isn\u2019t an apples to apples comparison, but the ratios in places like New York are lower than places like Atlanta. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you. Thank you, Mark. Mark Parrell : Thanks, Alex. Operator : Now we\u2019ll take a question from Haendel St. Juste, Mizuho. Haendel St. Juste: Hey guys, I guess it\u2019s still a good morning out there. Just two quick ones from me. I want to ask you, if you could talk a bit more specifically or share the math and how you underwrote the IRR on the assets you bought here in Atlanta and Austin. And how that compares to the IRRs on the assets that you underwrote when we sold that. Mark Parrell : I\u2019m sorry. Can you repeat the question? Haendel St. Juste: Can you hear me? Mark Parrell : Yes, I\u2019m sorry. Haendel St. Juste: So my questions on the comparative \u2013 my question is on the comparative IRRs, if you could talk a bit more specifically on how you underwrote the IRRs, but what you\u2019re buying in Atlanta and Austin and how they compare it\u2026 Mark Parrell : Got it. Got it. I missed the first part. Yes. So the big \u2013 one of the big differences age of the property. So we\u2019re selling properties that are a lot older that have, typically have capital needs. And again, we find buyers who look at the future a little differently than we do, want to invest the value add money. So when we look at that, we\u2019re not sure you\u2019re going to get the return on that. So it ends up in a lower IRR. The properties we\u2019re buying, we just see such strong demand for that. We think that that IRR over time will exceed, the one we\u2019re seeing. As a result of a combination of higher rent growth and less CapEx. Haendel St. Juste: So to be a bit more specific, I think you bought assets at 3.8 in a quarter you filled it 4.0, you\u2019ve mentioned in the past that you were looking to do these max funded deals on a net neutral to IRR basis. So I was curious if that was indeed the case here, are you able to underwrite where you\u2019re basically. Mark Parrell : So the numbers here exciting with the cap rates going in yields. What I was referring to as the longer-term IRR. You think the IRRs are higher and what \u2013 yes, Haendel, IRRs are higher on what we\u2019re buying and what we\u2019re selling and the cap rates are the same. So one good question that we\u2019ve been talking about on these calls is, are our shareholders going to miss out on some of the recovery on some of these assets we\u2019re selling, because we\u2019ve talked, it\u2019s going to be pretty strong income growth in California and New York. And I\u2019d say that there\u2019s not going to be the case because we\u2019re not selling the best assets with the best income growth. Our selling assets that have regulatory challenges or concentration issues where we own so much already in that submarket that the shareholders will get the benefit. Whereas Alec said, we just don\u2019t believe in the renovation play. So I think just again, we\u2019re selling what we believe our lower IRRs and buying higher, and we believe that\u2019s true both on the NOI side and on the net cash flow because of the CapEx. Haendel St. Juste: Got it, Mark. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then you\u2019ve mentioned development entities a few times here in your remarks and the Q&A, and you\u2019ve got line the risk on bouncy development. So certainly it sounds like building out an internal platform is just not in the cards near-term. I guess my question is how much more fruit do you think there\u2019s less to shake from your existing relationships like say toll brothers. You guys have a history of working together, looks like you bought one of your Atlanta assets from them. They have a large development footprint, a lot of \u2013 let\u2019s call it attractive markets. So they seem like an ideal partner. So I guess what\u2019s the perceived opportunity there, are you having conversations, and is that kind of fit the profile of the apartment you\u2019d be looking for? Mark Parrell : Well, first I just want to correct the beginning statement. We have a terrific existing development team. It just isn\u2019t in Atlanta. It isn\u2019t in Austin and it mostly isn\u2019t in Denver. So our development team, not as large as some of our competitors, but very capable, certainly exists that teams delivered Alcott this enormous $400 million building on time and on budget during a pandemic. So we\u2019ve got a very capable team and they\u2019ll continue to focus on things. For example, our California team, we\u2019ve got a lot of densification deals that we\u2019ve mentioned on occasion, but you\u2019ll hear more about in the next few years. And these are deals where, for example, Haendel, we have a 300 unit deal. You take down 60 units in a garden style, structure and you put up mid-rise 200 units. Those are terrific deals for EQR those we do on our own. We don\u2019t need a partner for that. So we\u2019re open to all sorts of partnership opportunities, again, national, local, regional, you should expect that we\u2019re exploring all of those things at this point. And we\u2019re thought of as high quality partner and we\u2019re looking for a high quality counterparty. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. Fair enough. And did not mean to diminish the team in any way. I was just making the point that obviously it could be largely given a company of your scale and just probing on if there are any opportunities under discussion today with, with toll brothers as I indicated, you \u2013 if you know, obviously you\u2019d be bought the asset in Atlanta from them was curious on it that was a fruit, the tree that could bear more fruit. Mark Parrell : Sure. Haendel, I don\u2019t mean to be defensive. I just want to acknowledge the contribution to the team. We got a lot of people working hard, a lot of people listening to this call. As it relates to any specific party, I mean, if we were doing something I couldn\u2019t tell you, and if we\u2019re not, it wouldn\u2019t matter. So I just would say, we\u2019re out there, we\u2019re always talking to people and that\u2019s Alec\u2019s job. He has a whole team that is out there talking to developers of all shapes and sizes. Haendel St. Juste: Well, I have to ask. But thank you for taking my questions and response. Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : And there appears to be no additional questions in the queue. I will turn the call back over to your host for any additional or closing remarks. Mark Parrell : Yes. Well, thank you, everyone for your time today. Enjoy the rest of the summer and we\u2019ll see you on the conference circuit in the fall. Thank you. Operator : With that ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

Please go ahead, sir. Martin McKenna : Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's Third Quarter 2021 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; and Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer. Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer; and Alec Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer are here with us as well for the Q&A. Our earnings release as well as a management presentation regarding our results and outlook are posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com. Please be advised that one of our peers is hosting their call at 1 pm Central, and so we want to be conscious of everyone's time, and we'll look to finish the call in 1 hour. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Thanks, Marty, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Today, I'll give some brief remarks on a terrific pace of our operating recovery and our robust investment activity then Michael Manelis will follow with some top-level commentary on the current state of our operations and how we see next year playing out, and then we'll take your questions. We have talked about 2021 being a year of recovery for our company. And we are very pleased to report that our operating metrics continue to recover at a faster rate than we assumed back in July with quarter-over-quarter same-store revenues turning positive for the first time since the pandemic began. Strong demand across our markets drove us to achieve physical occupancy of 96.6% in the third quarter, which allowed us to continue to push rental rates. We also benefited from governmental rental relief payments made on behalf of our tenants. As a result of these strong continued operating metrics, we have raised our annual same-store revenue, net operating income and normalized FFO guidance again this quarter. We now expect our same-store revenues to decline 3.7%, our expenses to increase 3.25% and NOI to decline 7% for the full year of 2021. We expect to produce normalized FFO per share of between $2.95 and $2.97, a 2% increase at the midpoint. All of this leaves us very well positioned going into 2022. While we won't provide guidance for next year until our next earnings release in February, in our management presentation you can find the building blocks that point to our business being set up for an extended period of higher-than-trend growth beginning in 2022 as we recapture revenue loss due to the pandemic and continue to benefit from strong demand and growing incomes resulting from a very strong job market. We expect same-store revenue growth in 2022 to exceed the historical mid-single-digit range that has characterized past recoveries, leading to some of the best same-store revenue numbers we have ever seen. These expectations assume that the economic backdrop remains constructive and the pandemic remains controlled. Please also note that while we expect to do very well next year, we will not be able to make up our entire mark-to-market on our rent roll and regain our entire loss to lease in a single year for a variety of marketing and regulatory reasons that Michael will describe in a moment. Beyond 2022, we see a continuing bright future for our business as the large emerging Gen Z cohort starts their careers and joins the renter population. Also, the more diverse portfolio we are creating should improve long-term returns and dampen volatility going forward. Switching to the transaction side of the business. The positive story on fundamentals has not gone unnoticed by the investment community as the overall theme continues to be enormous amounts of capital pursuing all types of apartment investment, driving cap rates to new lows. This has caused the convergence in nominal cap rates in the 3.5% or so range for many markets and has created a positive climate for our strategic repositioning efforts. We continue to aggressively sell our older and less desirable properties at these low cap rates and at prices that exceed our pre-pandemic value estimates, acquiring much newer assets in our expansion markets of Dallas Fort Worth, Austin, Atlanta and Denver and the select suburbs of our established markets at approximately equal cap rates. All of the assets we are acquiring share the common characteristic of being recently built, having no or minimal retail and being attractive to our target affluent renter demographic. We like that these trades are not dilutive to current earnings while adding properties to the portfolio that we believe will have better long-term cash flow growth, lower capital needs and diversification benefits. Year-to-date, we have purchased more than $1 billion of properties and expect to close another $400 million or so in acquisitions mostly in our expansion markets, a good number of which are in various stages of advanced negotiation already, all by year-end. We have funded these buys with an approximately equal amount of dispositions of older and less desirable assets, which we sold at an average premium of 10% to our pre-pandemic estimates of value. Included in these sales are approximately $900 million of California assets. Currently, approximately 42% of our total assets are in California. As we seek to have more balance in our portfolio, you should expect our California exposure to decline over time, but to remain meaningful. Turning to development. We had a lot of great news in the quarter. It all starts with the apartment development joint venture with Toll Brothers, the public homebuilder that we announced in August. We have known and respected the team at Toll for many years and have successfully partnered with them before. They built terrific properties and have a large team spread across our expansion markets and select of our other markets that we expect to leverage in this joint venture to create quality properties for equity residential to own long term. The venture is off to a quick start as we closed already in this fourth quarter on 1 Toll land opportunity and are working with them on many others. We also have a strong internal development team in our company that continues to create opportunities. In this quarter, that team completed the development of our Edge property in Bethesda, Maryland. This high-end asset is adjacent to an existing EQR asset and located very near a metro station as well as the large amount of new office space that has recently been built in downtown Bethesda. They also sourced and structured the 3 new joint venture development deals in Washington, D.C., Denver and suburban New York that began construction this quarter. Each of these joint venture development deals is with a different partner and is not related to the Toll venture. Before I turn the call over to Michael, a big thank you to all my colleagues in our offices and properties across the country. You're doing an exceptional job during what was a particularly busy leasing season, and we are all very proud and grateful. Go ahead, Michael. Michael Manelis : Thanks, Mark. The entire peak leasing season delivered consistent high levels of demand that allowed us to continue to grow occupancy as well as rates at a pace that exceeded our expectations. In both the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key performance metrics which demonstrate the strength of the leasing season and the fundamentals that position this portfolio well for 2022. Occupancy is 96.9% today which is 60 basis points higher than 2019 and 260 basis points higher than the same week in 2020. At this point, we expect to maintain strong occupancy through the balance of the year. Pricing trend, which includes the impact of concessions grew throughout the entire peak leasing season and is now 28% higher than it was on January 1. The pandemic caused our net effective pricing to decline by $520 from March to December of 2020. And from January 2021 to today that same pricing trend has grown $637 which demonstrates a V-shaped recovery and shows that we have more than fully recovered what we had lost in price. Concession use, which has been a main topic of discussion for the last 18 months is now being used on a very limited basis and in line with pre-pandemic levels, with less than 1% of our applications in September and October receiving an average concession amount of less than 2 weeks. New lease change was up 10.1% in the third quarter and is on track to be just over 11% in October. We have seen signs of seasonal softening, both in terms of pricing power and application volume but these trends are normal to slightly better than typical seasonality patterns. And more importantly, the volume of traffic and applications currently is more than sufficient given the low levels of available inventory we have in the portfolio. Renewals were a major focus for the quarter given the rapid improvement in market pricing from a year ago as well as the fact that we have slightly more expirations in the back half of 2021 than normal. We have been centralizing negotiations for the San Francisco, New York and Boston markets and our offsite call center group as pricing in these markets were the most impacted by the pandemic and conversations in these markets have become more and more difficult as we are dealing with residents who receive large concessions and much lower rates this time last year. The good news is that the results have been great across all of our markets. We renewed 62% of residents in September and October is on track to be just below 65% which is much better than the 55% historical norm that we thought we were going to stabilize at. At the same time, renewal rate achieved has continued to improve with September at 7.7% and October on track to be 9%. We expect continued growth despite what will likely be challenging negotiations. Perhaps our biggest positive from these negotiations is that so far, we are not seeing any material difference in renewal behaviors from the deal seekers who received very discounted rents last year versus our more tenured residents. Overall, they are renewing at similar paces. This is something we will continue watching very closely. Before providing color on a couple of markets, let me touch on our positioning for 2022. As we think about same-store revenue growth, we have some key drivers that should work in our favor. First, our existing leases are at a material loss to lease. What I mean by that is if we snapshot all of our leases in place today and compare them to current market prices, 86% of our residents are paying on average rent that are significantly below current market prices. The result of this is a net effective loss to lease of 13.6%. This provides us with a significant opportunity to increase our revenue as we move these leases to market rates. That of course does not mean that we will capture the full 13% in 2022 largely because leases expire throughout the year not on January 1. And we currently are subject to renewal restrictions in some jurisdictions which means the change is very dependent upon who actually moves out. Regardless, this is definitely the highest loss to lease we have ever seen with such a large majority of leases below market, and the teams are hyper-focused to recapture as much of the loss to lease as possible. Second, we expect that the significant demand and favorable fundamentals in our business will drive additional revenue growth opportunities in all of our markets in 2022. Remember, we have seen unprecedented demand even with only modest return to office activity. So the backdrop for intra-period rent growth expectations in 2022 is strong. Third, we expect to get a nice lift from occupancy in the first half of the year as we were at 95% in the first quarter and 96.2% in the second quarter of this year. We are currently running above 96.5% and would expect to maintain this level or better in 2022. And finally, we have regulatory restrictions that are beginning to expire. This presents an opportunity to recapture revenue through the reduction of bad debt and increased collection of late fees in 2022. All of these factors combined put us in a position to deliver very strong revenue growth next year, assuming regulatory conditions continue to improve and the general economic conditions remain supportive. Moving to a couple of quick market comments. Starting on the East Coast, the New York market not only has fully rebounded, but it continues to have strong demand for our product despite the broader delays in return to office. At this point, New York is positioned to outperform seasonal trends in the fourth quarter. Boston and D.C. are performing as expected, with great demand and strong occupancy with normal seasonality. On the West Coast, Southern California has been and continues to be very strong. San Francisco and Seattle appear to be the 2 markets most impacted by the delay in return to office in terms of overall demand levels but so far appear to be following normal seasonality trends. San Francisco, while demonstrating a good recovery remains the only market that has not yet fully recovered from a pricing standpoint. Occupancy has been improving in San Francisco over the past month or so. And today, we are 96.5% and should be well positioned to capture demand and pricing power once the tech companies begin to provide more clarity around return-to-office plans. Seattle has been a little more volatile than expected. Current occupancy is 95.6%. And while the overall demand level is holding up, the announcement from Amazon a few weeks ago regarding office return decisions has impacted our leasing velocity. Our on-site teams in Seattle mentioned that prospects definitely have a lack of urgency to lease, but are very interested in options for later this year or early next year. Moving on to expenses. Mark mentioned our same-store expense guidance at 3.25% for the full year. We are seeing increased costs across all utility categories. However, about 65% of these costs are ultimately passed back to residents through the utility reimbursements that run through the revenue line. We are also seeing pressure on wages in this very tight labor market but have been successful in mitigating growth in our on-site payroll numbers by realizing staffing efficiencies. These efficiencies have been achieved through the numerous innovation initiatives that we have rolled out over the past year or so. This includes moving to self-guided tours, online leasing and utilizing our artificial intelligent leasing agent named Ella. On the service side, we also leverage our service mobility platform and new technology to deliver the experience and service that our customers require which is evident by the all-time high online reputation Google rating of 4.2 all while also reducing the expense pressures. We expect these efficiencies and opportunities to accelerate into 2022 as we continue to harness technology to deliver the customer experience that our residents require. Finally, I will end on an update on the rent relief recoveries. Fortunately, our affluent resident was less impacted by the pandemic as they kept their jobs and continue to pay rent. For those that were impacted we have continued to work with them, including assisting them and applying for rent relief. We have received $18.3 million September year-to-date in this rent relief with the majority of that coming to us in the third quarter. This exceeds our prior expectations of $15 million recovered in the full year. Even with some of the eviction moratoriums expiring our goal will be to continue working with residents to gain access to the additional rent relief funds. We continue to have good traction in this process and now expect the full year rental relief recoveries of between $25 million and $30 million in 2021. Let me close by thanking the entire Equity Residential team for their continued dedication and hard work. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Joseph of Citi. Nick Joseph : Thank you. I'm hoping you can dive into a little more of your 2022 expectations. I know you said the same-store revenue should be among the best in history. How much of that is locked in today in terms of the earn-in? And then you talked a little about trying to capture some of that loss to lease. It won't all come in through 2022, but how are you thinking about getting to that comment about being among the best in the industry? Mark Parrell : Nick, it's Mark. Thanks for the question. We're not giving '22 guidance, but as you said we did try to lay out how we're thinking about things what the building blocks are, what the team is trying to figure out as we look towards '22. When we made the comment both in the release and in my prepared remarks that it's setting up to be the best year in the company's history. For same-store revenue growth, I do want to give a little context. So a normal and I'll say a normal meaning the last couple of recessions for us have consisted of 2 years or so of negative same-store revenue growth, and we've certainly had that this time. A year or so where same-store revenue growth was right around zero slightly positive, slightly negative, kind of a transition year. And in a couple of years where we compounded 5%, mid-5% same-store revenue growth numbers for high-4s, those kinds of things. Given the earn-in given this loss to lease that we see, we think we're going to skip that transition year and that's a comment I made on the last call as well. We're going to skip right over that zero and head right into a year that's likely to be a fair bit higher than the 5.5% or so number you would think of as a normal second year recovery. The recovery is V-shaped, just like the decline was V-shaped. And so I think what you see here is the confidence the team has given the demand and the occupancy numbers. That's subject to some regulatory flak here and there. We're going to regain a great deal of that loss to lease, but certainly not all of it. And I think a bit of it is going to end up in 2023. And there's just customer relations issues. There's regulatory issues with some of these increases in the size of them. And Michael has done a great job with the team of retaining our residents giving them great service. So hopefully that helps. In terms of locked in, I can't give you a locked-in number. The team is going to need to work the whole year to do that. But it feels like that 5.5% is a bit of a floor in terms of next year's same-store revenue number. Nick Joseph : That's very helpful. And then you mentioned the compounding in some of those past cycles and maybe we can tie to development. It seems like you're getting at least more active on development. You mentioned the Toll JV and some of the other opportunities. I mean how are you thinking about the beginning of this cycle and getting more into development as you try to model out some of those out years where you'll actually be delivering? Mark Parrell : Great question. It's Mark again. In terms of the compounding the compounding is going to start with the operations with the NOI from the same-store portfolio. Look at '22 when we've given you some color. And certainly it's hard to look much further in our business. But we do look at '23 and see less supply. There were a lot of deals that were delayed the starts due to the pandemic. And while supply is likely to pick up in '24 our look at proximity of supply and other things makes us feel like we got at least a couple of years here, pretty good numbers coming at us on the same-store NOI. And that will always be the big engine at EQR. Development to us is just a great complement to our efforts to acquire assets especially in these newer markets, these suburban markets. And we feel like right now, our shareholders are getting paid to take that risk with our ability to underwrite development yields at around 5 on current rents. And all of these acquisitions we're looking at being in the mid-3s. We're trying to be very thoughtful. This is an inflationary climate, and construction costs are far from immune to that. But I think you're going to see growth both from the same-store portfolio and from actual net growth of the company through development that we're likely to fund with a combination of incremental debt, net cash flow, which we'll have more of starting next year and occasional asset sale and a little bit of equity like we did this quarter. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Pawlowski with Green Street. John Pawlowski : Thanks for all the details on the revenue components. I actually have a few questions on the cost structure of the business. Bob, could you give us the expense pressures hitting some other property types in the REIT world. Could you give us a sense on how bracket a reasonable worst-case and best-case scenario for same-store expense growth over the next 12 months? Robert Garechana : I mean I'm not going to probably give specifics in terms of a range because we're not providing guidance yet. But maybe a little bit to think about the components that are running through and where they're positioned as we go into 2022 if that helps, John. So you think about the big 4 categories real estate taxes we've had a good amount of success. That's 40% of expenses. We've had a good amount of success so far on appeals. I think we're not seeing a ton of pressure from the municipalities. And I think that could carry over into another pretty good year into 2022. So pretty good year means in my mind kind of sub that 3-ish or 3.5% kind of regular run-rate inclusive of 421as and other things. On the payroll side, we've done an excellent job I think of managing what has been an inflationary kind of pressure over time. We're going on our third year of payroll that is sub 1% in terms of growth. So what Michael is doing sometimes quietly on the side in terms of managing innovation and doing new implementation is really offsetting what I think is something that every company is experiencing, which is payroll pressure. And we've been really good at it thus far. And I don't think there's anything that's likely to change in a significant way. It means that we feel the pressure. We're just doing things in a different way and innovating in a way to really offset that pressure. The last 2 categories, which are R&M and utilities I think, are the ones that we're most focused on outside of like the payroll side. A big chunk of them can be passed back to the residents, but we're certainly all seeing commodity pressures. You saw what that gap has done kind of recently. And that's the one that I think is where you see higher single digits. But put it all into the blender, I don't think that 2022 is that outsized relative to what we've seen historically in this business over time. John Pawlowski : Okay. That certainly helps. Maybe Michael, 1 quick one. Just in terms of the posture on renewals. Could you share the renewal rate increases you're signing out today? Michael Manelis : Sure. So this is Michael. And I'll tell you that for November, our net effective quotes were coming in or going out at 12.8%. And the December quotes are 13.2% on a net effective basis. And you could see that number is going to continue to grow, and it's going to widen because concession use was really ramping up this time last year. So you're coming up against more and more of those residents that had concessions. About 25% of all the offers that went out for November and December went to residents that had concessions. And I think, as I said in my prepared remarks so far the deal-seeking residents that we took in last year, they've been renewing at the same pace as compared to those that didn't have concessions. So we're really excited about kind of working our way through the renewal performance for the balance of the year. John Pawlowski : Understood. Thanks for that. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Rich Hightower of Evercore. Rich Hightower : Just a quick follow-up on development. So you started 3 new projects. Last quarter you delivered 1 of them. Obviously, the Toll joint venture is earmarked for several of your expansion markets. So how easy is it to crank up the development machine internally? And what volume of starts do you think that we can sort of expect over the next few years in that regard? And then if you had to peg a mix between on balance sheet or I should say, in-house versus the Toll joint venture? How would you see that breaking out? Mark Parrell : Hey, Rich, it's Mark. I'm going to start. And then I'm going to give it over to Alec. So in terms of how big it can get it will take a little while to ramp up. Our expectation is this could get to $1 billion to $1.2 billion a year of starts in a year or so and maybe $700 million of that is Toll and the rest of it is other JVs and the stuff that we create internally. I think that, that will be funded in a way that will make that a pretty accretive thing. But most importantly for us, it's creating and giving us product again in markets and submarkets we just don't have enough exposure. So I think Alec can speak a little bit to things the internal team is doing because they're very active. They're doing a lot of good stuff. We got some great densification deals we haven't talked a lot about. So I'm going to let him speak to that. And hopefully, that gives you the color you need. Alexander Brackenridge : Thanks, Mark. Rich, this is Alex. Yeah, so we look at a lot of deals. We are a selective developer. And whether it's through the Toll JV, which has been off to a great start. They have a great pipeline and we're actively engaged with them on each project and assessing whether it fits for us. And then as Mark mentioned, we have these densifications throughout our portfolio, largely in California but in other markets as well. And we have a great internal expertise on how to assess and execute on. So we're excited about that. And then as we've mentioned in the release, we're continually looking at other joint venture opportunities outside of Toll. So we have a broad range of projects that we look at and are very selective on the ones we pick. Rich Hightower : Okay. Great. I appreciate the color, guys. And 1 quick follow-up. Just in terms of the recent acquisitions in the expansion markets. Can you give us a sense of where you're acquiring those properties versus replacement cost in addition to the yield which you have provided? Alexander Brackenridge : So it's a range, depending a lot on the project. And this concept of replacement cost is an important metric. It's something we look at but it's not an absolute thing. It's actually a little bit more challenging to calculate than you might think because you don't always find an apples-to-apples and may be a location that's really almost impossible to find similar product to build - some of the location to build the same kind of product. Parking is another variable. Surface parked, you may have an existing project that has surface parked, but the municipality won't allow you to do that or the project sites too dense. So that maybe you go to a structured parking, which is more expensive where you go underground which is yet more expensive. On top of which there are code changes that can generally make things more expensive and inclusionary housing requirements. So we look at it as a metric we look at, but we assess all of those things on a project-by-project basis and determine whether or not we think it fits based on that and the typical yield parameters that we assess. Rich Hightower : Okay. So it's hard to sort of peg a percentage discount or premium given everything you just mentioned. Alexander Brackenridge : There's no absolute number. Rich Hightower : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. Chandni Luthra : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. So I just want to follow up on 1 of those questions that were just asked around your new development projects that you started this quarter through your internal platform. Could you perhaps talk about what are the markets where you will focus your internal development versus the focus coming in from the Toll Brothers JV? Thank you. Alexander Brackenridge : So we have - and Chandni, this is Alec. We have specific markets that we've designated through the Toll program that we're going to focus on. And for example, Atlanta is a market that we're very focused on with them. Dallas is another one. There are other markets where they don't have a presence or they're not part of the venture. And so those are areas where we'd be more likely to invest on our own or with another joint venture partner. Chandni Luthra : Got it. And talking about supply a little bit into next year and perhaps 2023. What are the markets that you're feeling a little better about versus where do you see there could be more crowding especially as you are sort of foraying into all these newer markets? If perhaps you could give some color on that, that would be great. Thank you. Michael Manelis : Chandni, this is Michael. Let me just start. I'll give a little bit of kind of the takeaway from 2021, a little bit about what we're seeing from an operations impact in '22. And then I'll let anybody else kind of pick up on some of the newer markets that we just entered. So I think I would start by saying that the tagline for 2021 on supply would be that strong demand greatly aided the absorption of new supply in our markets. D.C. produced record levels of Class A absorption and the South Bay, which we talked about on previous calls in San Francisco. That submarket at 4,000 new units being delivered. It continues on its path of recovery with strong occupancy and very limited concessions like in the stabilized portfolio. And I think we've talked about this before that we are really focused when we think about supply, and the concentration of the supply and the proximity of that new supply relative to our stable assets on top of when are the first units going to actually begin leasing. So for 2021, the overall supply numbers were elevated in our markets. But we said earlier on the call that the overall level of competitiveness against our portfolio was expected to be less. When we look forward, the data for the expected starts in 2022. So relative to this proximity of within 1 and 2 miles of our locations is less, which is a great indicator that we should continue to feel less pressure in the next year or so from the new supply being delivered right on top of us. Chandni Luthra : Thank you, Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jeff Spector of Bank of America. Jeff Spector : Good afternoon. My first question, Mark, I guess, what held you back from providing '22 guidance at this point? Mark Parrell : I guess, 17 years of experience doing this job and the CFO job. I mean a lot - this is a pretty variable world. A lot's going on. Certainly, the actions of the Fed on the taper are super relevant to how the economy recovers. So I would say there's just enough variability here. We told you sort of what we know, Jeff, which is this sort of earn-in, this loss to lease. We gave you I think some pretty specific parameters on where things like bad debt might be able to go. And then the big mysteries really are regulatory pressures, how the intra-period growth feels next year. And then where we end this year? I mean we're going to spend the next 2 months continuing hopefully to close some of that loss to lease by writing terrific new leases with happy customers and locking in revenues for next year. So there's just enough variables where any guidance I'd give you would be too wide to be meaningful on same-store revenue. And I think the conversation in February will be much higher quality. Jeff Spector : That's fair. Thank you. And then second, I know you touched on supply. I don't think I heard the answer on '23. And we're hearing potentially on the coast, a significant decrease in supply in '23. And I'm sorry, again, if I missed this, any early thoughts on '23 supply in your markets? Mark Parrell : All right. It's Mark. Thanks for that, Jeff. So what we see is a pretty significant decline in '23 a lot - and this is again in deliveries, just to be clear. And that's really as a result of delays in starts or delays in completions of product that was underway during the pandemic. And so we're going to get a break - more of a break in New York, for example, but even that is a little bit by area. There'll be a fair bit delivered in Brooklyn. There'll be a fair bit delivered in the Jersey Coast, but in Manhattan, almost nothing. D.C. will kind of continue doing what D.C. does and deliver a lot. But we're going to feel a lot better about places like San Francisco and Los Angeles and Seattle. So we feel like we're walking into a pretty good setup. When you start thinking about what might deliver in '24, and those are things that are starting now, there is a lot of development activity. The space is in great demand. The investment community hasn't not seen the strong recovery and the stability of the sector. And so we think there'll be a good amount of demand - or excuse me a good amount of supply, but probably more spread out. The market that's most on the watch list of our new markets for supply is certainly Austin. Austin has a lot. We're being very thoughtful about adding exposure there. You may see us slow that down and add it a little bit later. There's just going to be 30,000 units for some number of years there. Atlanta feels pretty good to us on supply. Dallas has supply, but it's spread out and it's a big demand market. So I guess that's the color we'd give you. Denver has a lot of supply too more downtown than otherwise. But again, we have a portfolio we're building that in Denver will be a pretty diversified portfolio when we're done. Jeff Spector : Thanks, very helpful. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Rich Hill : Good afternoon, guys. I wanted to come back to talk about the disclosure that you provided on rental assistance which was really helpful. If I'm looking at the numbers correctly, does it imply that another $10 million to $12 million of rental recovery is going to come in 4Q? Robert Garechana : Hey, Rich, it's Bob. That's probably a little bit on the high end of the range. But yeah, I think you're in the ballpark. So we think, as Michael said, for the full year, we'll be at $25 million to $30 million. And we're already at $18 million so far through 9/30. Rich Hill : Got it. Helpful. And so as you think about 2022, do you think that's going to be a clean year? Or will it also have some rental assistance in it meaning is the same-store revenue number going to be - will it benefit maybe even to the upside from additional rental assistance? Robert Garechana : So I think that it probably will benefit from some of the rental assistance and '22 will likely be kind of a transition year. But it also is going to experience this elevated write-off too. Because you still have that is unlike like '19, similar to what we've seen in '21 and '20, right? There's 2 things that will drive bad debt. One is the rental assistance payments; and two is just the ability to start collecting on the units that haven't been collected. And that's a small number for us. It's been a small number given the high-quality renter base that we have. But those are the 2 driving factors that I think are going to make 2022 as kind of bad debt number between what you would have seen in '19 and what we saw in maybe 2021. Rich Hill : Got it. And would you be willing to maybe frame how much of a headwind that might be? Robert Garechana : I think that we'll have a better idea as we get to kind of providing guidance in general. But just to be clear, I don't think it's a headwind. I think it's a benefit to revenue. I think we kind of alluded to that. I think we should be in a better position in '22 than we were in '21. Rich Hill : Got it. I understand. That makes perfect sense. I thought it would be a long shot but figured I'd ask. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Rich Anderson : Thanks, everybody. So when you think about the surprising pace of demand improvements. Obviously, the economy turning on after shutting down so rapidly is a big part of it. But related is the opening up of offices. Of course, and universities and people rushing to get back to be close so they can be present when the time comes that they have to be in the office. So assuming you agree with that. Won't it be true that as things settle and you kind of have this - all this stuff be a wash in terms of year-over-year comps that the cadence of 2022 would be super strong year-over-year growth in the first half but a return to earth in the second half? I'm not looking for a guidance question here just sort of speaking out of logic. Mark Parrell : So Rich, it's Mark. I'm going to start and maybe others will contribute. So the rushing back to the office thing. I'd point out, a lot of people are coming back because the city is reopened. They're not sure when they're employers coming back to full time. But they want to be back because they love the lifestyle in West L.A. and they love living in Downtown Seattle. And they want to go back to their favorite coffee shops. And you and I have had this discussion before. I think it's a little bit about return to office, but it's also about just energized cities attracting our kind of residents. In terms of the shape of the curve, I don't think you're wrong about that. I think the numbers early have to be extraordinary because the comp period is so poor in '21 that that's exactly what will probably occur. But what else will be going in the other direction is the normalized FFO by quarter number. Because as Michael's team writes better and better leases, as Bob does this accounting work and roll those numbers up, you're likely to see the earnings power of the firm in the middle part of the year revert back to what it was in 2019. So again, the quarter-over-quarter numbers are going to be exceptional early and they're going to be merely very strong late in the year. But I think what you're going to see besides those operating statistics, Rich, is that quarterly normalized FFO number get better I think, every quarter of next year. Rich Anderson : We should be focused on FFO anyway, I think but that's just me. And then second question on - is hybrid office like a perfect setup for multifamily? And the reason I say that is people will be more inclined to choose a nicer place to live with amenities and other conveniences just because they're going to be spending perhaps more time there in the hybrid model. Do you agree that hybrid office would be a particularly good thing in the sense you might get more fee income? And with that in mind, why avoid then retail at the ground floor and your new acquisitions? I guess I understand why. But just throw that question at you too on this topic. Alexander Brackenridge : Hey Rich, this is Alec. And I think San Francisco is an example where people aren't back in the office, but they still want to be in the cities. To your first part of your question, I think the hybrid model does work well. Because it enables you to do both, enjoy the city and also be close enough to work to get in when you have to go in. So we're seeing the impact of that. And we are working on making our amenities more suited to that. So we've increased a lot of our co-working space within our amenities. And we haven't said no to retail. We like ground floor retail. We like activated streets. We just would like to have a relatively small amount of it compared to the apartment business that we love. Rich Anderson : Okay, sounds good. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey good afternoon. So I have 2 questions here. First, I don't think anyone asked about the ATM. You guys are not historically an equity issuer. No offense, but $140 million is almost a pocket change for you guys. So curious on your decision to issue equity, especially as it doesn't settle for another year and half, given that you guys are good assets sellers. You're getting cap rates that are commensurate with where you're buying. So just trying to understand how this ATM fits in and should we expect more of it? Mark Parrell : Alex, it's Mark. Thanks for the question. So we thought it was prudent to dust off the old ATM as you put it and put it to some use here. And it's really about this increase in development spending. So our typical development spending needs the last 3-4 years have been $300 million to $500 million. And here, I'm talking about spending, not start. So of course, they correspond. And we were funding that out of free cash flow and a little incremental debt that didn't change our ratios because you had the new development assets on your books creating income after they were stabilized. Going forward with the idea that we're likely to start $1 billion or $1.2 billion a year after a ramp-up period, you need to be very thoughtful about how you match fund that. And when you look at 2023 we have a pretty significant amount of debt maturities in that year as well. And that's probably the first year we're going to reach this run rate of starts. And so it seemed prudent to us after consulting with the Board to take a little equity into the mix. I think you're right that it will predominantly be funded with free cash flow. And we expect to have that again next year. And hopefully in some good abundance, incremental debt, occasional asset sales as long as we can stay within our taxable income kind of caps. And then we will. I think we will be issuing a smattering of equity here and there given the size of the development expectations for the company in the next few years. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. But still that's - Mark, it's a pretty big shift. So is that the recent addition of new Board members? Or I'm just curious because, historically you guys really haven't been equity issuers. So it does sort of represent a shift in your financing strategy. Mark Parrell : I guess I don't view it as a shift. It's the same group of people, maybe in different chairs, but it's the same conversations. I mean we don't want to dilute our current investors. That's an important priority. But we do think that when you're creating new assets having a little equity foundationally makes sense. We know what the cash needs are to fund the development pipeline. So the conversation with the board was very easy on this point. They felt that if you were $300 million, $400 million, $500 million a year spender of development, that was 1 thing. If you're going to double it that was a whole another thing. And so that was the real thing that changed, Alex, it's just this magnitude of what the management team is suggesting development can be. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Great. And then the second question, and you probably could guess it. Local New York press is talking about how Governor Hochul was trying to fend off challenges for her reelection from the left. And good cause rent eviction seems to be back, and it seems to almost be given for Albany. Your view, if that goes through is does that change your plans as far as selling down New York more? Or does that make it say like, New York almost becomes like a stable rent foundation market? Or does this mean like, we could actually see our property taxes go down because if they're going to limit rent increases then it's hard for them to raise property tax. So just sort of curious how - because it does look like there's a pretty good chance good cause does pass this time. Mark Parrell : Yeah. A lot of parts to that question. So I'll try - I'm going to start though with the policy part. That good cause eviction is just rent control by another name. It's bad policy. New York said rent control, you know you live there for - since World War 2 and the housing situation in New York has not improved. This is just going to cause less housing to be built and more disinvestment in existing housing. And there's a lot of better ideas like SP9 in California and 40 B in Massachusetts and some of these zoning reforms in Minneapolis that should have been thought about. So we're disappointed if it indeed is the direction it's going. And we'll work through our association to suggest other better alternatives. But let's assume it does go. It was our intention to lighten the load in New York. I think New York is going to have extraordinary revenue growth next year as a result of just going back to where it was in '19, frankly. And so the idea of putting good cause eviction in where it's going to affect landlords who have been beaten up by the pandemic have property taxes to pay and all the rest seems like particularly bad timing and is going to particularly discourage production. It doesn't make us want to own more in New York City. That's for sure and in New York State. So I guess I'd say it's a negative to investment in the city and in the state. In terms of lower property taxes, I love that idea. They did come with lower taxes than we expected for the most part this year in general. We'll see. I don't know many municipalities that like to keep their property taxes low if they can raise them. So I'm guessing they won't lower them for us enough, Alex to kind of reimburse for what's about to happen if good cause comes through. But again, it's just a bad policy idea, putting aside the impact on EQR and we can respond to it. We'll lighten the load New York, and that's unfortunate. And a lot of other people will do the same thing and there'll be less capital for housing in New York. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you, Mark. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Brad Heffern : Hey, everyone. You talked a little bit about the Bay Area already, but I was wondering if you could put some more color around your expectations as to how the recovery plays out over time. I'm just thinking about it in the context of in New York, you saw occupancy and pricing come back at basically at the same time. But in the Bay, occupancies come back, but pricing really hasn't. So is it as simple as just people with higher incomes needing to come back to work at their tech jobs? Or is there something else going on? Michael Manelis : Hey Brad, this is Michael. So I think you have a little bit of everything going on. I think right now, as I said in the prepared remarks, we're pretty well positioned in San Francisco. There is demand coming back to our product. It's just the pricing power wasn't quite where it needed to be to kind of recapture everything that was lost through the pandemic. So I think right now, when you look at the portfolio and you look at how it's positioned. As there's some, I guess, additional clarity around what return to office looks like, the tech companies have been all over the place in that market. So just a little bit more clarity, probably bring some incremental demand. And that most likely will happen after we get into the New Year. And the portfolio that we own right now is very well positioned to capture that demand and recapture some of that rate. When you look at it from a submarket basis, I said a little bit on the deliveries in the South Bay. We thought we were going to have pressure in the South Bay because of the new supply being delivered. We're really holding up really well there. Now the rate hasn't fully recovered, but the rate recovery in the South Bay is better than the rate recovery in Downtown San Francisco. So I think we need a few more months to just see how some of this ambiguity kind of flushes out, and then we'll have a better feel as to what that means for next year. Brad Heffern : Okay. Perfect. And then on bad debt, you have on the slide some of the potential there. But you also said you don't expect it to really - fully get recovered in 2022. Can you just talk about what some of the impediments are there? I mean is it strictly just eviction restrictions? Or what else would keep it from - what else would make it play out over a longer period of time? Robert Garechana : I think it's - it's Bob, Brad. I think it starts with just getting to the point where these residents that haven't been able to pay start making different housing choices or are in a position to start paying. And so that can come in a few forms. It can come in the form of some of the eviction restrictions being lifted. It can come in the form of residents now being employed again because the economy is in a much better spot and they can start paying again. But there's a process that we're all going to have to go through of kind of unwinding this or moving back to kind of a market level, and that's going to take a little bit of time. That's unlikely to be a light switch like activity, especially as we work with residents' kind of figuring that out. And so as a result, I think '22 is going to be that transition year I alluded to. That's probably the biggest thing. And then to add a little bit - to the financial statements, to add a little bit more noise associated with it or make the forecasting harder as I like to say around here. You're going to have the trickle down of the government rental assistance payments because those programs eventually will come to an end as well. So it's really the unwind part of that, that's likely to occur in 2022. Brad Heffern : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Amanda Sweitzer of Baird. Amanda Sweitzer : Thanks. Starting with the lots to lease. Are you able to provide that number by region? And then can you also quantify how much of your NOI is subject to those regulatory restrictions you mentioned that would constrain our ability to fully realize that loss to lease next year? Michael Manelis : Hi, Amanda. This is Michael. So maybe rather than going by every market, I'll just start by saying that the majority of our markets, so Boston, D.C., Seattle, Southern California and Denver, all fall within a range of a net effective loss to lease between 11% and 15% with about 80% plus of the residents in those markets being below market prices. Not surprising, San Francisco has the lowest with a 5.7% net effective loss to lease with 67% of residents paying below current market prices and New York is the highest with 21% loss to lease with 93% of the residents paying below the current market. And as I stated in my prepared remarks the loss to lease is a snapshot of today. And it never has translated into full year revenue growth because you have to work your way through those expirations. And I guess I'll just stop and just say that all of that being said, this is the best position the portfolio has ever been in for the ability to capture it. But I think you need several months into next year to really understand how you're going to translate that into revenue growth and how much of that is going to roll into 2023. And in regards to kind of thinking about the restrictions or the governors. I guess I would say it's really hard to understand because it's so subject to who is actually going to renew, who's going to move out and what your abilities are and what the caps are in place. And there really are so many different programs out there. So it's really difficult to try to quantify that for you. Amanda Sweitzer : Okay. That's helpful and makes sense. And then just given the scale of the Toll Brothers JV, are you able to talk more about how the potential buyout would be structured in terms of the implied acquisition yield versus that 5%-plus stabilized development yield that you cited? Mark Parrell : Hey, Amanda. It's Mark. I'm going to start and Alec may have something. But we're underwriting these deals and generally for Toll to bring them to us is we said they need to be in that 5% yield range on current rents or better. And so right now, Alec and his team are buying at a 3.5% or so cap rate on existing assets. So that's at 3.5% to 5% difference, that 150 basis points or so of margin that again, we think is compensating us for the risk. So when we buy the asset, we will be paying Toll of promote presumably. And so we'll be buying it at a slightly lower cap rate than that 5% in my example, assuming no intra-period rent growth. But again, because of the way the promote is structured and all of that it's not that meaningful a difference. I mean we're 75% of the capital in the deal or the equity capital in the deal. So is that helpful to you? Amanda Sweitzer : It is. Appreciate the color. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Thank you. Mark, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about cap rate conversions to around 3.5% across your markets. And I realize multifamily is a very hot asset class. But with rates rising and now 20% rental growth achieved in many of the submarkets. Are you seeing any upward pressure in cap rates in your markets? Mark Parrell : Alec give you detail in a second because I have been a little shift here and there. But it's interest rates matter, but fund flows matter more. And fund flows right now are highly favorable into the space because of the performance matters you mentioned. Though there were significant declines in urban apartments, they came back pretty quick. And because the GSEs existing as a financing option that no other sector has. So I think when we look back at our research, there was generally a 200 basis point difference between whatever cap rate we thought we were underwriting on acquisition whatever the 10-year spot treasury rate was. Right now the 10-year spot treasury rate is 1.5%, a lot of what Alec buying is very much close to that 3.7. So it might be a little lower, but it's not a lot lower. So I don't feel like we're that far out of whack. And I do feel like, generally speaking when we look at the whole sort of situation it generally seems to make sense to me. And I don't think that interest rates rising alone as long as cash flows increase will drive values down. But Alec, I don't know if you want to talk about the bidding cash you're seeing? Alexander Brackenridge : So John, this is Alec. There are in some cases, slightly fewer bidders showing up at the auction. That's kind of the feedback we get from brokers. But I'll tell you, the pricing hasn't gone down. In fact, it's continued to edge up. So there are some participants who have kind of stepped back and said, Well, I'm not going to win anyway. So I'm not going to spend my time underwriting this, but there's still enough, as Mark says, funds flowing in to make it for a very competitive bid to be able to prevail. On our end, what we're trying and are doing is matching up the timing of our dispositions and our acquisitions. So we're effectively making a neutral bet. We're not going out on a limb. So that's protecting us. And in the sort of spirit of full disclosure on this. A lot of our buyers are leveraged buyers of our assets. So if the Fed raises floating rates, but if they stay still relatively low compared to the cap rates, these are good leverage buys. So that's one of the other thing that continues to force capital into our space. John Kim : That's great color. Thank you. In your presentation, you talked about maintaining occupancy at high levels for the remainder of the year. And then Michael talked about renewals out at 13% in November-December. Are you basically saying that you're not seeing much resistance to this level of renewal increase and expecting turnover to increase? Michael Manelis : This is Michael. So I would tell you, our expectations are the continued success that we've seen in retention will balance out the rest of the year and probably even next year. We're in the mid-60s right now for October even the trends for November are very promising. The increases are getting more significant. We're having more conversations around negotiations, but just feel really positive about the ability to deliver results from that process. John Kim : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our last question from Rob Stevenson of Janney. Rob Stevenson : Good afternoon, guys. Given Prop 13, as you continue to trade $1 billion of California assets for $1 billion of Sunbelt, how much is that going to push property taxes up? And are we going to be at elevated same-store expense level because of that going forward. Presumably, you'll have higher revenues to offset that. But is same-store expenses just going to be higher just simply by trading California for elsewhere? Mark Parrell : And so it's Mark. Just to clarify that, Rob. You mean that in California because of some of these Prop 13 limits, property taxes can't grow as much going forward. I mean in our - as maybe in Atlanta, they wouldn't be bounded by that. Well, I guess I'd say a couple of things. First, for example, in Texas, there's a whole bunch of property tax limitations that are coming into place on both commercial real estate, residential real estate. Alec and his team underwrite these increases. So if cash flow isn't going up net-net, then those assets aren't going to be appealing to us. So I'm not sure what you said is certain because when you say same-store expenses, maybe property taxes go up more. But I'll tell you, California minimum wage is a lot higher. California, all the other compliance costs that go with owning in California are much higher. So I think if you're talking about holistic same-store expenses, I'm not sure I believe, at least for the first 10 years or so of owning a California asset that there's going to be that much of a difference in same-store expense growth. But Alec, do you have a - Alexander Brackenridge : Well, the other thing I'd add, Rob, this is Alec is that we're buying properties at on average 2 years old and selling properties that are 30 years old. And that expense load on the older properties tends to accumulate over time. And so that there is a very significant trade-off there. Rob Stevenson : Okay. And then the other 1 for me. I don't - I mean it doesn't sound like that you have an exact number. But are you sort of figuring out as a percentage of revenue that you're still losing today as your loss to regulation, executive orders, eviction restrictions? How material in general is that? Is that 1% of your sort of, call it, $625 million of quarterly revenues? Is that 2%? Is that 0.5% in terms of ballpark, how big is that that you're having that you're either foregoing or you're incurring additional expenses to comply with et cetera? How material is that? Or is that an immaterial amount that we should be focused on? Mark Parrell : It's Mark. I'm going to start and if Bob or Michael have anything they'll add. But I'm on Page 12 of our press release, we give you a bunch of disclosure about residential bad debt and maybe this will bound this up for you. In 2019, our write-offs, so that would be a direct negative against residential revenues were about 40 basis points. That's a good run rate of delinquency in our portfolio rents we never receive and that burden same-store revenue. When you look at what happened last year in '20, where there were no recoveries and the pandemic was 3 quarters of the year and this year, you see on the bottom of 12, we're talking about numbers that are in the 2%, 2.5% range is a headwind. Now the problem we're having is forecasting for you, where between 40 basis points and 2.5% does next year fall. And that depends on how quickly the court's process evictions, our success in continuing to work with our residents, which is always our first goal whether government revenue - government rent relief programs kind of leak, Robert, into next year or mostly are covered this year. So that - hopefully, that gives you a boundary, but that's what we have to be a little general about because there just isn't certainty in our mind and across so many court systems and so many jurisdictions for us to know how all that stuff plays out. Rob Stevenson : And part of that is also the remainder of the rental assistance, the other sort of $8 million to $10 million that you guys expect in the fourth quarter? Mark Parrell : Very much so. And you can see what it did to our Q3 number went down to 70 basis points. So we can have a - but yeah, we told you that we continue to collect all but 2.5% or so of our rents. So when we're - that changed a little. It's getting a little better collections are every month from what is still a very good collection level already. But this government money is definitely hard to predict. And then when we can start working with people more directly and getting them into a housing situation that's stable for them long term, I don't know when that is exactly, but we think it's coming up. Rob Stevenson : Is there anything of any material substance to you that's expiring either at year-end or over the next 3 or 4 months without renewal by either a governor or legislature? Mark Parrell : So the New York Eviction moratorium we understand expires in the middle of January '22, both commercial and residential. California's statewide eviction moratorium has expired, but there are some city of Los Angeles rules out there still. Boston instituted an eviction moratorium that has no set expiration date. They have an election in a week and then after that we'll see. Seattle has an expiry of their commercial and residential eviction moratorium in the middle of January of '22 as well. So you could see I'm giving you a hodgepodge of dates, there's local overlay. There's a lot going on here. So that's why you're getting a range from us and not the precision that we usually try and give you. Rob Stevenson : Okay, thanks guys. Appreciate it. Mark Parrell : Thanks, Rob. Well, I think that's the end of the call. We're appreciative for everyone's time and attention on the call today. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Equity Residential Four Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead. Marty McKenna : Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's full year 2021 results and outlook for 2022. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer; Alec Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer is here with us as well for the Q&A. Our earnings release is posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. I will now turn the call over to Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Thanks Marty. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. This morning, I'll make some remarks about what we see driving our operating results and cash flow growth this year and going forward. And I will comment on our capital allocation program and what the company will look like when it's complete. After that, Michael Manelis will review our operating performance and outlook for 2022 same-store revenue. Bob Garechana will spend a few moments discussing our innovation activities and their impact on our business. And then we'll go ahead and take your questions. We're very excited about the prospects for our business in 2022 and beyond. Our affluent resident base is well employed and receiving healthy raises and they are renewing with us at record levels. The robust demand for Apartment Living in both urban and suburban locations is driving high occupancy and the lowest resident turnover in our history. Our same-store revenue guidance calls for 9% growth at the midpoint, while our normalized funds from operations should grow at about 15%. Both of which would be the best performance in our history. Cash flow from our business is likewise poised to grow strongly. We see this at the beginning of what should be a good run of performance as we welcome the 67 million member strong Generation Z to the rentership world, and as we continue to attract and retain millennials, with our flexible product offerings and a price point that is increasingly affordable relative to surging single-family housing costs. That said, we are aware of the recent storm clouds on the horizon in the general economy, which include high inflation and related concerns about how the Federal Reserve will manage short-term rates in its balance sheet as well as continuing supply chain disruptions and unfortunately, the latest COVID variant. While we are not immune to these pressures, a considerable amount of our expected 2022 revenue growth is already baked into our results in the form of leases recently signed at higher rates as well as an expectation that even if rental rates do not rise in 2022, resetting leases to current market levels will provide a significant revenue boost. In 2023 and beyond, our ability to reset lease rates annually should create a natural hedge in a more inflationary world. We also continue to successfully execute on our expense control management with 3% growth in 2021 and a midpoint expectation of 3% growth in 2022 despite the impact of inflation on many costs in the economy. We run an incredibly efficient platform and continue to harness technology to control expenses, enhance the customer experience and grow our operating margin. Bob will comment on all of this in a moment. Switching over to investments. We had a very active year on that side of the business, with $1.7 billion each in acquisitions and dispositions as well as progress in ramping up our development activities. We continue to optimize our portfolio by successfully recycling out of older assets and deploying capital into newer assets in our expansion markets and the suburbs of our established markets. Our 17 acquired properties have an average age of two years as compared to our 14 disposition assets with an average age of 30 years, and we're recycling all this capital while not diluting earnings. Our 2021 transaction activity on both the buy and sell-side was done at an average cap rate of approximately 3.8%. In 2022, we expect to both sell and buy approximately $2 billion in assets. Our acquisition activity is focused on building out our portfolios in Atlanta, Dallas, Fort Worth, Denver and Austin as well as adding select assets in the suburbs of our existing markets. We continue to see great opportunities in our markets and expect to deploy $2 billion into them in 2022. On the development front, we commenced construction on approximately $450 million in development projects during 2021 and expect to deliver high-quality properties in Denver, suburban New York and Central Washington, D.C. in several years. We also completed the construction of our $400 million Alcott Tower in Central Boston during the quarter, and we're pleased to report that the lease-up is going very well. In terms of the development pipeline. In the quarter, we entered into four separate development joint ventures, in Texas and in Colorado with the Colorado joint venture beginning construction in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the other three expected to do so in 2022. These three parcels are the first in our development program with Toll Brothers. As we have discussed with you before, we are reshaping our portfolio to reflect the demand trend we see of some affluent renters spreading out from the coast and congregating in markets like Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth and Denver. We also see a similar but more local dispersion trend in our coastal markets as another group of higher income renters move to the suburbs of our established markets like Bellevue, Washington, near Seattle; and Burlington, Massachusetts near Boston. Now we've always had a presence in the suburban submarkets of our established markets. So what I'm talking about here is just creating a little more balance between urban and suburban markets. We will also continue to have a substantial investment in the urban centers of our markets, and those will continue to attract, we think, high-quality renters seeking to enjoy the many amenities of urban living. Driven by our analytical research and informed by our long experience in the apartment business, we seek to build and buying newer assets in urban and suburban locations in these markets where we see demand from higher renters as being high and likely to grow where single-family housing is expensive relative to renting and where supply is manageable. We expect our refined portfolio to have about one-third of its assets in the three Northeastern markets of Boston, New York and Washington, D.C., with a reduction in exposure coming from New York and Washington, D.C. dispositions. We see approximately one-third or maybe a bit more of the portfolio being in California with divestments there occurring in challenging regulatory locations and of older assets. The remaining third or so of the company will be concentrated in a diagonal from Seattle through Denver, to Austin and Dallas, Texas and over to Atlanta, Georgia. We think this distinct portfolio of newer, less capital-intensive assets in the 12-or-so most desirable metros for more affluent renters to live will provide high and stable long-term returns. We also see reduced regulatory risk and resiliency benefits from this portfolio shift. And finally, before I turn the call over to Michael, I want to give a big thank you to all my colleagues in our offices and properties across the country. You are doing an exceptional job during very unusual times, and we're all very proud and grateful. We're in position for a great 2022, and I look forward to delighting our customers and our investors with you. Go ahead, Michael. Michael Manelis : Thanks, Mark. This morning, I will provide highlights on how we finish the year and give you some color on 2022 revenue guidance and market performance. So first, a big thank you to our teams across the country who have worked so hard during these trying times to deliver these results and are all geared up to make 2022 a terrific year for Equity Residential. The recovery continues despite the presence of the Omicron variant and noise from uncertainty in back-to-the-office plans with tremendous demand to live at our properties, both urban and suburban. We see reopened restaurants, entertainment venues and other lifestyle amenities as attracting our affluent resident base without regard to continuing low office occupancy rates. Absent a government-mandated closure of businesses in cities, which we see is unlikely, the lifestyle that our residents crave is again available in most of our markets and our residents are voting with their feet and pocket books to be in these locations whether they anticipate working fully remote, hybrid or fully in the office. Interestingly, we see a little less of this trend in our tech heavy Seattle and San Francisco markets, which I will discuss in a moment. We are currently 96.5% occupied and are on track to deliver about 13.5% achieved new lease growth in January after posting just over 10.5% in the fourth quarter. We reported the lowest turnover in our history for both the fourth quarter and full year 2021 which reaffirms the desirability of our product as our resident signed renewals at record levels with increases that average nearly 11% in the quarter. In addition, our residents received $32 million in rent relief with $15 million of that received in the fourth quarter. This performance has positioned us well for 2022 and what we believe will be the best same-store revenue growth in our history. The majority of our 9% same-store revenue growth at the midpoint is coming from resetting existing leases at current market rates. As of January 1, 83% of our residents were paying on average rents that are about 11% below our current market prices. As we have discussed in the past, we won't be able to capture all of this loss to lease in 2022 because leases will reset over the course of the year either through new move-ins or renewals, and there are currently a few regulations that cap our allowable increases. In addition to capturing this reset, we are anticipating intra-year growth in rates that is more reflective of typical seasonal growth than the steep growth we experienced during the 2021 pandemic recovery year. Strong, continued physical occupancy, particularly relative to the comparably weaker period in early 2021 is also a contributor with the remaining growth projected to come from lower bad debt, improved nonresidential revenues and other income. So far, we continue to see strong retention with the percent of residents renewing expected to be just over 60% in both January and February. We may see some moderation from this high level as the year goes on. But interestingly, in Q4, we did not see much disparity in renewal percent for deal seekers, those residents who had a concession on their current lease versus non-deal seekers, meaning many of our residents are deciding to stay put regardless of the rent increase. While the world remains an uncertain place, we feel good about this expected pricing power, given our net effective pricing trend is currently 27% over 2021 levels and 7% over the same pre-pandemic week in 2020. A key driver of this improvement is the sizable reduction in concession use in our portfolio, which is nearly nonexistent with the exception of Seattle, that I will get to in a moment as I provide color on the markets and how they are expected to contribute to 2022. Beginning with Boston, which is following a normal seasonal pattern with improving demand and pricing heading towards the spring, overall, we're 96% occupied today with a drag from the urban core at 95.5 versus the remainder of the market, which is above 96%. With strong continued demand from lab and life sciences, financial firms, health care and education and very little competition from new supply, we expect this market to produce same-store revenue growth of approximately 10% in 2022. Another positive note is that we continue to see a return of international students and workers to the market. After a difficult period early in the pandemic, the quick turnaround of the New York market has been really amazing. We expect New York to be our best-performing market in 2022 with same-store revenue growth of approximately 13% despite some expected pressure from new supply on the Jersey waterfront in Brooklyn. Demand is very strong, and we have been renewing about 65% of our residents. Occupancy remains above 97%, rates continue to improve, concessions are not being used and pricing is currently 11% over pre-pandemic pricing levels. We expect that Washington, D.C. will be a solid performer in 2022, but will end up as one of our lower producing revenue growth markets at about 4%. This market held up the best of our East Coast markets during the pandemic, and so does not have the same ground to make up. This market also continues to deliver 12,000 or so new units each year, absorption of Class A multifamily has been really strong even during the pandemic, making us optimistic that this absorption trend will continue. Occupancy is steady at 97% and rental rates are following a slightly better-than-expected normal seasonal pattern here. Moving to the West Coast. Both of our tech heavy markets, Seattle and San Francisco, have been slower to recover than other markets. While there is certainly demand, the downtown submarkets are 93% and 96% occupied, respectively. The ambiguity and return to office by big tech employers and quality-of-life challenges are deferring a fuller recovery. We expect that the quality of life issues will improve through a combination of civic engagement and having more activated streetscapes. The tech companies have a role to play here as they balance their growth plans versus employee preferences or work from home in a highly competitive job market. It appears likely that the balance will be met by a hybrid work model which should benefit our business in these markets. But until there is more certainty, some employees will be hesitant to make housing decisions. Longer term, the overall drivers of demand remain positive and we would expect the urban centers of these markets to fully recover because they remain attractive to the many affluent renters that want to enjoy in urban lifestyle there. Also, the tech giants continue to accumulate large amounts of office space, whether through leases or whole building purchases, which indicates that their long-term plans involve some level of in office. We're optimistic about Seattle's recovery and expect the market to produce same-store revenue growth of approximately 10% in 2022. Our expectations are predicated on the CBD, where we have a large concentration of assets recovering in the back half of the year. Demand is improving. Initial lead and tour volume has ramped up past 2021 levels but our on-site teams are reporting a lack of sense of urgency from potential renters to sign leases right now. Occupancy has rebounded slightly to just over 94.5%. This market is the primary user of concessions in our portfolio with currently about a third of our applications receiving on average just over one month free. Heading down to San Francisco, we are seeing good demand but do not yet have a lot of pricing power. We expect to produce same-store revenue growth of approximately 7% in 2022. San Francisco continues to be the only market in our portfolio that has not gotten back to pre-pandemic pricing levels as we are currently 6% below the same week in 2020. Occupancy is holding steady at 96.5%, and we are renewing just under 60% of our residents. Los Angeles continues to be a solid performer with demand driven by a robust return of the online content industry. Occupancy is running at 97%, pricing power is strong. We expect the market to produce same-store revenue growth of approximately 9% for the year. The percent of residents renewing is the highest we have seen likely due to the impact of local regulations. We expect to continue to renew 65% to 70% of our residents here. Both Orange County and San Diego continue to show remarkable performance with high occupancy and strong retention, supporting very good new lease rents. We expect these markets to produce same-store revenue growth of 10% or greater in the year. In Denver, we have very good demand and expect the market to produce same-store revenue growth of approximately 9% in 2022. Occupancy is strong at 97%, and we're renewing about 50% of our residents. Lastly, a few thoughts on our additional expansion markets of Atlanta, Dallas and Austin. So far, our newly acquired assets are performing well. Demand remains robust and occupancy levels are high. The expansion markets have seen good growth throughout the pandemic, and we expect that growth to continue in 2022. This is an exciting time for the industry and the overall operations of our company. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Bob Garechana. Bob Garechana : Thanks, Michael. Rather than go through a detailed review of our guidance assumptions, which are laid out on Page 4 and Page 27 of the release. I thought I'd take a moment to elaborate on our approach to innovation, our continued investment in our platform and how that's playing out in our financial statements in 2022 and going forward. Over the last couple of years, we've had impressive results in our innovation journey, and it's not over. A few highlights that our property management and operations teams have been busy rolling out. We brought mobility to both the service and sales teams to enable and enhance flexibility. We have artificial intelligence handling 80% of our communication with prospects to lower cost and provide 24/7 service. We've deployed roommate matching functionality on our website to drive additional revenue, and we've moved 97% of our tours to self-guided or virtual, all while increasing our gross rent potential by using data and analytics to improve our amenity pricing. These are only some of the examples of how we continue to advance our efforts to maximize efficiencies on site and improve revenue while meeting the ever-evolving expectations of our residents. We have done so successfully through adjusting our processes, deploying new technology like the artificial intelligence I mentioned and through advancing our use of data to inform our business decisions. We have most visibly seen financial benefit from these endeavors and our ability to successfully minimize our on-site expense growth, particularly payroll. In 2021, we reported negative on-site payroll after reporting less than 1% growth in the prior two years, and we're just getting started. Our focus moving into 2022 continues to be building upon the success we've already achieved. That means continuing to improve our digital customer experience, our business processes and to advance our sophistication and data-driven decision-making tools. This is an area in which we have historically been a leader and expect to continue to excel at going forward. Our approach remains focused on efficiency, marries technology and data and should reduce exposure to expense pressures while increasing revenue growth. In order to accomplish this, we're making investments in foundational areas like centralized teams, IT infrastructure and licensing and data analytics, which is driving a good portion of our forecasted overhead growth in 2022. These investments enable our progress in our innovation journey and have significant ROI that should continue to garner margin improvement benefits in 2022 and beyond. I'll now turn it over to the operator for the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Nick Joseph with Citi. Nick Joseph : Thank you very much. Maybe starting on the transaction side. Mark, you mentioned the $2 billion this year on acquisitions and dispositions, I think, at a 25 basis point dilutive cap rate. How are you thinking about that trade from an IRR growth perspective over the next few years? I know you're buying newer assets and selling older assets. So I just want to understand how you're underwriting that? Alec Brackenridge : Hey Nick, this is Alex Brackenridge. And yes, so we feel like the assets we're buying will have higher IRRs over time. It's a combination of both higher top line rent growth but also less capital demands over time as well. So we feel like we're in a point in time where we have an opportunity to have a really good trade of selling these older properties into newer properties in these markets that are very, very robust. Nick Joseph : Thanks. Are you seeing any difference in the buyer pool or competition for the assets that you're trying to buy versus what you're selling? Alec Brackenridge : Just that it keeps getting bigger. The multifamily is clearly a favorite asset class. And we see people that had gone away coming back. And certainly, in our coastal markets that were quiet or like New York, it's full bore. I mean people that we're investing only in office are now investing in apartment, people that went down south have come back north. So it's a competitive bid both for what we're selling and for what we're buying. Nick Joseph : Thanks. And then just what does 2022 guidance assume for government rental assistance? Bob Garechana : Hey Nick, it's Bob. We're roughly assuming maybe slightly below half of what we got in 2021. So in 2021, just to remind the group, we received about $34 million. And so we expect the programs to kind of start tailing off as we go. So about half of what we got in 2021. Nick Joseph : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Pawlowski with Green Street. John Pawlowski : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe to take Nick\u2019s question a step further, Alec, just in terms of how your team is approaching underwriting intermediate-term growth. So if you went and sampled all the deals you've underwritten on the acquisition side in recent months or currently underwriting, would the intermediate-term NOI growth assumptions be higher or lower for the average Sunbelt deal versus the average Coastal acquisition? Alec Brackenridge : That's a hard question for me to answer in specific, as on every deal is a little different. Every rent roll, obviously, is different. There's a lot of still to be picked up rent growth in both what we're buying and selling. But you're getting it kind of in a different way and some of the things we're selling, there's still maybe some pandemic recovery. And what we're buying, generally, there wasn't a big pandemic downturn. But there's still \u2013 the market has moved so quickly. You still have leases under. So net-net, we feel really good about the short and medium-term growth of these expansion markets, but it's coming from a different source. Mark Parrell : Hey John, it's Mark. Just to add to that. And the risks are different in each of these markets. So you get into the intermediate term with some of the markets that we call our established coastal markets. And there is a bit more risk of rent control and things like that interrupting rent growth in those markets. I'd also just say that when you look at the growth in some of these markets, we think of the new portfolio is having a bit of a handoff and this diversification is going to serve us well. We do have supercharged growth this year because of the recovery in our established markets. And as we establish the Sunbelt presence, we're going to have more balance. And I think you're going to see just more balanced growth. So maybe there is a little more growth in the Sunbelt and a little less in established, but we'll pick that up and vice versa. So from our perspective, it's sort of a risk-adjusted thought process and a diversification thought process. So maybe the established markets drive the machine for the next 18 months or two years and maybe some of these diversification markets help add power to the engine in outer years. John Pawlowski : Okay. Thank you for all thoughts. Final question. Michael, I'm not sure I fully understand why there's been such a large and persistent breakage between net effective pricing trend and the blended reported spreads. So since July, your effective pricing trends been \u2013 over 20% above the year prior. So I would have expected new and renewal \u2013 acknowledging they're very healthy, out of expected, new and renewal to be closer to 20% than 10% eventually. So I'm not sure if it's regulation or just more time is needed. Any comments there? Michael Manelis : Well, I think it's a little bit of both of those factors. So one, as that pricing trend improves, it's a lead indicator as to what to expect on that new lease change and renewal in those forward months. But I think clearly, you're subject to who's moving out and who's moving in, a little bit of the timing of when those original leases were written. And then clearly, we are subject to some of these regulations right now that are limiting our ability, mostly on the renewal side of the business with allowable increases which, in my mind, just defers kind of the rent growth that we were going to see in 2022 and pushes it more into 2023 because we're going to recapture that spread again either through that next renewal or at move out and time of a new lease coming in. So I think you're seeing, too, the trend, if you look at that January kind of trend. You're going to continue to see that growth in these first couple of months of this year with both new lease change and the blended. And then you'll start to see us come up against that comp in the back half of the year, and it will start to moderate a little bit. So I think you're seeing us close that gap with that net effective pricing trend, but I don't think you should ever expect that we're going to fully realize those numbers. John Pawlowski : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to ask about your same-store revenue guidance. You had signed leases at 13% increases in January. You talked about this positive pricing trend of 27% over last year and then 11% loss to lease. And on top of that, your market rental growth, which I'm sure is not really factored into this. But how do you get to the low end of your same-store revenue guidance of 8% just given these other factors? Bob Garechana : Yes. Hey John, it's Bob. I'll take a stab at this, and I'll piggyback with Michael, if there's anything. I think when you think about the range on the revenue guidance side, and Michael outlined in his script a little bit, most of the growth is coming from rate, right. And there's different flavors that you just outlined in terms of rate. A lot of that rate is kind of, I'll call it, baked in because it's capturing that existing loss to lease, et cetera. The way you get to the low end of the guidance range is that you don't get as much intra-period market rent growth during 2022, right. So if you think about it as we kind of continue on the pricing trend, the low end would imply that we don't get much intra period. The higher end would imply that we get more intra period than what we otherwise anticipated. And the midpoint is slightly above trend, above historical trend intra period growth. And that's how you kind of balance the range. The range is a little wider than what we've historically done because I do think there is a little bit more potential for volatility given what's out there. But those are kind of the low end, the middle and the high. John Kim : And what do you expect as far as the difference between new and renewal leases? They're basically on top of each other in the fourth quarter. I would have thought that you would have had a higher new lease rates, just given it goes straight to market rather than renewals where you may be more difficult to reduce concessions. How do you think \u2013 how do you think that goes for the rest of the year? Michael Manelis : Yes. So this is Michael. I think clearly, in the first several months of the year, you're going to see that new lease change starts to outperform the renewal numbers. We got pretty good insight into the renewal performance for the first quarter. You can look at what we're quoting for February and March and see that it's kind of right in line. We've been quoting just around 14%. We're achieving around 12% in these months. I would expect that to continue. But on that new lease side, you're going to see a little bit more momentum kick in here as you go January, February and probably even into March, and then you'll start to see it kind of moderate a little bit. And as you turn the corner and get towards the back half of the year, I think those numbers are going to converge together. John Kim : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Rick Hightower with Evercore. Rick Hightower : Good morning, guys. So I guess just to dig down a little bit on \u2013 in terms of new and renewals. If we go by market, there are some pretty dramatic differences. I'm looking at San Francisco, but that's not the only example between new lease change and renewal rates in the fourth quarter. But what's interesting, too, is the pattern differs across different markets, right? It's not consistent across the market. So what explains that? Is there something with concessions that's driving that? How do you expect that to trend over the year? I mean, give us maybe a little more detail on some of the market-by-market color there. Michael Manelis : Hey, Rick, this is Michael. So I'll just start, I think, maybe, are you focused on the sequential changes that you're seeing across the markets and the differential that you're seeing in the fourth quarter over the third and the momentum? Rick Hightower : I'm looking at just for the fourth quarter, the differences between new lease growth achieved and renewal lease growth achieved. And again, San Francisco being a good example of, call it, a 900 basis point difference one versus the other. But again, that pattern is not consistent across all markets. Michael Manelis : Yes. So I think you got to go market by market and you got to understand the retention. You need to understand the regulation limits of the caps that you're bumping up against. And in certain markets like San Francisco or even in New York, you got to understand the concession use that was in play this time last year or in the fourth quarter of 2020 and that comp period is kind of what's driving some of that. So I would be looking more into that January kind of projection and just thinking about where you see those spreads today and know that the renewal number is probably going to stay like I just said, in that similar range, but you're going to get a little bit more momentum out of that new lease change in some of those recovery markets. Rick Hightower : Okay. Okay. Maybe we can dig into it kind of separately off the call. But that is helpful. And then my second question, just on the 25 basis points of, call it, net investment dilution forecasted this year embedded within guidance? I mean I think you guys did a little bit better than that in 2021, maybe versus original expectations. What are the chances that you can exceed that little bit of dilution in 2022 with your investment activity. What would drive that? Mark Parrell : Hey Rich, it's Mark. Our goal is not to have any dilution maybe even have accretion, that would be wonderful. But we're trying to do is build a great long-term portfolio, and there are timing issues, too. So I'd just tell you that 25 basis points of dilution is just what's in our model. It's just what's in our guidance. The number could be slightly more or slightly less. Right now, it feels great to be selling these assets in these established markets that are older, they're nice properties, but there are a lot of older assets, they have big capital needs, sometimes regulatory challenges in buying these newer assets in these new markets for us. So that trade even feels like a good deal to us. So I think you'll continue to see us trade even if it's de minimisly dilutive. And again, there are timing issues, too. Sometimes you sell before you buy and things of that nature. So I'll tell you, the goal of Alec and his team is to trade as accretively as possible. But on the other hand, not to be fooled by that initial cap rate and to be thinking hard about the long-term return on the asset. Rick Hightower : All right, thank Mark. Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you, Rich. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Rich Hill : Hey good morning, guys, and congrats on a very solid quarter. We run a cash model. And so I wanted to speak a little bit about the same-store revenue guidance on a cash basis. I recognize that you didn't provide that. But I would think that the cash number would be higher than the GAAP number given the rent benefits that you're providing in 1H of 2021. Can you provide what it would be on a cash basis or at least walk us through if our reasoning is correct? Bob Garechana : Yes, Rich. Let's talk through this a little bit. So let's talk just straight on a cash basis kind of what we're assuming in the 2020 revenue number. So in 2021, right, you had call it, $27 million, which we disclosed on Page 12 of cash concessions. We're assuming at the midpoint of our guidance that we have significantly less concessions in that, right. So this is all cash to cash, right. And so therefore, we're thinking that we're going to normalize something back to normal. It's not quite the 4Q annualized, but it's something in that general ballpark that we're assuming at the midpoint. So what's happening, I think, is the inverse of what you just talked about. So in 2021, the GAAP number was negatively impacted by concessions. In 2022, it will benefit from concessions, right. So the cash number on a year-over-year growth rate basis should be a little bit lower than the midpoint that we had in our guidance range. And based on the numbers that I just outlined to you, it should be, call it, 60 basis points lower at the midpoint than the 9% that we just gave. Mark Parrell : And Rich, just to add a little bit, it's Mark. The general rule you should think about here is that when you're doing concessions, and we were in a concessionary environment for a while, at the beginning, when you're issuing large amounts of concessions, your concession fully net effective number for revenue will be higher than it would be on a cash basis. We're now at the tail end of that where these concessions are going away, and that means that the opposite is now generally true and that you're doing a little bit better on the other direction. So your GAAP number is generally not doing the same. So that's just so you understand the trade. So when we disclose on Page 12, as Bob said, that for the full year, the difference is 4.6 GAAP versus negative 3.2 cash. You're effectively going to have that thing switch around a little bit. You're not going to have concessions improving your number like you did. You're going to have concessions hurting your numbers slightly. And that's what it does. So I think our cash number is 80 basis points lower. Bob Garechana : It's about 70 basis points lower than the nine at the midpoint. So you've got more like an 8.3 on a cash basis year-over-year than the nine. Rich Hill : Got it. That's crystal clear, guys. And I'm really asking the question because it's obviously not uniformity across your peers about how that's reported, which I think is important to understand. I want to come back to the new leases and renewal leases. I appreciate the transparency and the disclosure about why you might not be capturing the whole 20% growth. But I think what I heard from you is next couple of quarters \u2013 next couple of months, you can expect to be a sort of a steady state as to what you showed in January. It will begin to decelerate in the second half of the year. But as we start to look forward to 2023, and I'm not looking forward \u2013 not looking for you to guide here. But what I thought you were telling us was the near-term is never going to be as high as a 20% blended. It's going to be lower, but that probably means you extend some of it out into 2023. And therefore, the blended spread in 2023 can probably be higher than what some people were expecting because it's just pushed out. Is that the right way to think about that? Michael Manelis : Yes, absolutely. It defers it and pushes it into the next year. Mark Parrell : So just to be clear, you will get all of that change. It's just a matter of when. And that depends on, as Michael said, the lease maturity schedule, a little bit of regulatory pressure, those sorts of things. But you'll get the whole thing unless the market changes. It's just whether it's all this year or a little bit falls into 2023. Rich Hill : Got it. And so said another way, if you're going to put up, let's just say, slightly less than 12.5% blended, we should think about rolling the difference between that 12.5% and that 20% into 2023? Michael Manelis : Yes. I mean, I think a lot is going to depend on what intra-period growth looks like and the timing of that growth, whether it's early in the year or later. But yes, I mean, I think that's a fair way to model. Rich Hill : Okay, thank you guys. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. In terms of San Francisco Bay Area, I was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit more about \u2013 you said that good demand but not pricing power, and maybe you could talk about how that's doing in the different submarkets you're in, in the Bay Area? Michael Manelis : Yes. Hey Nick, this is Michael. So clearly, there's a divergence, right. With the city of San Francisco, is the area that has the most pronounced spread to the pre-pandemic pricing. You actually have pockets as you work your way in through the East Bay that's right on top of it. The peninsula is really approaching kind of that pre-pandemic. And the South Bay, despite the 4,000 units that just came to the market, is also just like that peninsula area, it's right on top of that pre-pandemic pricing. So I think what we're seeing is just when you roll it up at the market level, and we're still that 6% off of the pre-pandemic pricing, it's mostly weighted down from the city of San Francisco. And you have signs of that demand returning in there. You just don't have quite enough of it to get to that pricing power that you need to fully recapture everything. But the signs are there, and the question is just how fast in the year you can get to that price because the earlier we get it, the more it's going to yield the revenue growth this year versus deferring into 2023. Nick Yulico : Okay. Thanks Michael. That's helpful. Going to the bad debt that number that's been just under 2% that on Page 2 of the stuff that is an additive benefit to your same-store revenue growth and it's been the same number over the last two quarters. How should we think about that benefit continuing to play out in 2022 from a timing standpoint, from a quarterly standpoint, are you still getting that for a couple of quarters? Bob Garechana : Yes. So hey, Nick, it's Bob. Let me talk about the kind of two competing factors that go into that number as we think about how we modeled it in 2022. So one of the competing factors is the rental assistance, right. So rental assistance, which I think we talked about a little bit earlier on the call, we'll reduce that number, and we do expect that to trail into 2022 because the programs are not completely done. And we would expect that to be front half, right. And so that will benefit you on the front half basis. The opposite competing factor is just the actual resident behavior in terms of who's paying, who's not paying and how that kind of progresses. We do expect a benefit for that to occur, but that's probably more back half loaded. So what I think you're going to end up having, depending on how this all plays out is something that's pretty constant, maybe a little sub-2% level that will be kind of throughout the years as you go through the quarter. But those are your two factors that are driving kind of the bad debt. We do think on an absolute basis the bad debt will be lower with both those factors in 2022 relative to 2021. Mark Parrell : And maybe we'll give a little bit more precision and Bob will help me. It's Mark here because I'm just playing CFO now. I'm not actually doing that job anymore. But our \u2013 in the old days before the pandemic, our bad debt write-offs are generally 40 or 50 basis points of revenues. They obviously went up considerably during the pandemic. And now you're getting these pretty variable numbers because of these \u2013 the great job Michael and the team have been doing with our residents of getting some of this government rental relief money. So the question on the run rate is probably a number that's in the 1.5% range for the year because it's still \u2013 there still are eviction restrictions and where they aren't, there's just slow processes. And there's just still some stuff the system needs to work through, Nick. So our sense is it's higher than a normal year but considerably lower than the 2.7% or so we were feeling through most of 2020. Is that a good enough number, Bob? Bob Garechana : Yes. So even more specific. So we have, call it, $30-odd million of bad debt net of rental assistance in 2021. A normal year to Mark's point, would have been something more like 10%. We won't get all the way back to the 10%, but we might get close to halfway there in 2022. So we'll add something that's, call it, $15 million to $20 million of bad debt is what we've included in our guidance. Nick Yulico : Okay. Very helpful, guys. Just one quick follow-up on the renewals. You talked about, you felt pretty good about keeping pricing for renewals this year. I mean should we assume that something over 10% is baked into the guidance for renewal growth this year? Michael Manelis : Well, no, I think what you need to remember is that the first part of this year is going to be strong. It's going to be these 12% numbers on the renewal. And then as you turn the corner in the back half of the year, I think you should expect some moderation. So I don't think it's materially below 10%, but I'm not sure we're going to stay at a 12% run throughout the whole year. Nick Yulico : Okay, thanks everyone. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. Chandni Luthra : Hi, congratulations on a strong quarter. So I'd like to talk about your relationship with Toll Brothers. Builders obviously have been experiencing widespread disruption. They have talked about labor challenges, materials and sort of extending their cycle times. Toll Brothers also in December kind of talked about its own cycle times getting extended. So what are you seeing from your standpoint? And then any change there from a timing perspective, when do you expect to deliver the first set of developments within that relationship? Alec Brackenridge : Sure, and this is Alec. So what we're seeing \u2013 and we haven't broken ground on anything in our joint venture with Toll, yes. I don't have any Toll-specific information on something that's under construction. But I can say that for the projects that we're working on with other partners, it's a question of timing, right. So things have pushed out by a matter of months but it's not whether or not the project gets done. And that's true of us and many of our competitors as well. So people are getting around the supply chain challenges, either by finding substitute products or warehousing the inventory that they need. So costing a little more, taking a little more time. But on the other hand, rents have been rising. So I'm not sure yields in most cases, have materially changed. The other thing that we would say is we are in a different business, apartment construction versus single-family home construction. I mean that's more of an assembly line at a moment. You just need 1,000 windows, you need them right now. And for us, we have longer cycle times. It's a lot longer period of time to build an apartment building than a single single-family home. So maybe you don't have the windows, but maybe you have all the dry wall you can do or whatever the situation is. You can kind of manage things a little bit better than I think you probably can if you just can't deliver the house at all because you just don't have a key component. Well in apartments, you can go to a different stage in the process, at least sometimes and knock that out. Chandni Luthra : Understood. And then I'd like to follow up on your expense outlook. So obviously, if you kind of go back and look at 2019, your expenses were a little over 3.5%. And then 2020 and 2021 were very well controlled and you gave some color on payroll growth in 2021 and sort of how that was a big tailwind. As we think about 2022 with the midpoint of 3%. Besides payroll, what are the other factors that are helping if you think about big categories such as taxes, utilities, repair, et cetera? Bob Garechana : Yes. So let's start with the biggest category because it is \u2013 we expect it to continue to be a help as it was in 2021, which is real estate taxes. So real estate taxes, we do expect to grow below trend. And a lot of that has to do with timing as well. So some of the real estate jurisdictions are not on calendar years, so they're on different fiscal years. So we've already got like locked and assessed values that are lower or rates that are lower or just the general health of the jurisdiction is better. So we have a little bit of that continuation kind of flowing through. So we'd expect real estate taxes to be more around a 2% kind of growth rate than maybe in 2019 or historical and real estate taxes were more three to four. So that will drive some of the assistance. The payroll, I think you already hit upon. Utilities and R&M will be probably mixed, will probably be a little above average. I think that depends on a variety of factors on how it flows through on utilities with commodity prices and other areas where we've seen a little bit of relief as of late. A lot of the utility price we're able to pass back to the resident. So it's more of a geography than a kind of net-net impact overall. But it's the combo of good expense controls and initiatives associated with payroll, continuing to manage the R&M piece and then also benefiting from real estate taxes. Chandni Luthra : Got it, thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brad Heffern with RBC. Brad Heffern : Hey, good morning, everyone. On the development front, you have the $450 million and starts in 2021. Can you talk about what that number is expected to be in 2022 and maybe any trajectory over the next few years? Alec Brackenridge : This is Alec. Yes, we're working on growing that pipeline. $450 million was a kind of jump-starting our program, which was helpful to that Toll had these three projects ready to go. But we're hoping to grow that to $1 billion or $1.2 billion over time. This year it will probably be somewhere between the $450 million and $1 billion. Brad Heffern : Okay. Got it. And then on the transaction front, how do you think broadly the market is likely to respond to these higher rates? Are we going to see eventually cap rates move up with some sort of lag? Or do you think that just the underlying growth expectations have increased enough that things value sort of end up in the same place? Mark Parrell : Yes. I mean, we're in that latter camp, Brad, it's Mark, about value staying, give or take where they are. I think interest rates going up are pretty manageable for value. So you think about the customary spread, and we talked about this on the last call of between the 10-year treasury and prevailing apartment cap rates of being 200 basis points give or take, and you imagine the Fed moving short rates and long rates responding and you wonder if the cap rates should go up. And I guess \u2013 given how durable multifamily cash flow has proven to be even during what was, I think, the biggest crisis in the industry's history in the last few years. I mean, we were hit pretty hard and we're right back in two years and on a good growth trajectory and the great prospects going forward. I feel like that bit of a risk premium is going to decline a bit. I also think there's a wall of capital that I know you're well familiar with that wants into real estate and specifically into apartments. I heard that number quoted as all sorts of different numbers, but it seems to be at least $100 billion or more. So I think that creates a floor as well. So our sense is that as long as interest rates going up, doesn't crush growth and take the whole economy into a serious recession. Values will remain pretty good. And I also think you're going to get both real and nominal cash flow growth. So I think your NOI that you're applying your cap rate too, is going to improve as well over the next few years. Brad Heffern : Great, appreciate the color. Thanks. Alec Brackenridge : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good morning out there. Just going back to the opening comments on the rent increases, and you guys were clear that a lot of this year is going to be driven by the burn off of the free rent from last year. Just based on the rents that you're sending out on a face-to-face sort of apples-to-apples comparison, how much are the new rents going up? So basically, if someone had two months free last year, is it just reflecting that now they're not getting that two months free to whatever they were paying in face last year is what they're paying now. Or are you able to raise that face rate, call it, 5%, 10%, 2%? I'm just trying to get some perspective on the actual rent increase. Michael Manelis : Hey Alex, this is Michael. So maybe I'll start with this for a little bit. So there's a couple of ways to look at that. First, you can go into the fourth quarter kind of statistics around like the new lease renewal and the blended and just look at the difference between like a net effective and a gross \u2013 and I'll tell you, you can almost say it's about a 300 basis point impact where outside of concessions that net effective is being kind of lifted up by about a 300 basis point impact from the use of concessions in that prior period. But a better way to kind of think about this is if you look at the loss to lease that we have today in January, and I'd say we are approaching right at around 11%. That's on a net effective basis. And when you look at that on a gross basis, so without any regard to any concession activity either last year or this year, it's about a 75 basis point impact. So you have about a 10.25% loss to lease right now on just rate. And that's the opportunity that allows you to work your way through 2022 and capture that rate, and some of that will fold into 2023. Alexander Goldfarb : So then if the bulk of the mark-to-market is really rate, not necessarily concessions, you're saying your inability to capture that is really just purely from markets where you're restricted on your ability to push rents? Mark Parrell : And timing, right, not all leases expire, Alex, on January 1. That's the other. So you got to \u2013 so it's a little \u2013 it's Mark, it's a little bit of both. I mean certainly, there's some regulatory restrictions, particularly in Southern California, but there's also just timing. We don't \u2013 our leases don't overrule January 1. So what we do is that we get that money the next year. So that is going to contribute to 2023. And just to talk about the concession. I mean we did take all that pain through the system. Our shareholders felt that. So the fact that there is some concession makeup. I mean that is real cash flow we didn't get that we will get. So it isn't \u2013 I don't think you're implying this, but it isn't an accounting charge. It is a true cash flow reduction we had that we're now getting back. Alexander Goldfarb : Yes. Look, look, no landlord wants to not get paid for rent. Totally agree with you, Mark. The second question is on the assets that you're selling. Obviously, great cap rates on the sale. But if you think about your basis on those assets, what's the current yield that you're giving up? So great that you're selling whatever 3.7, awesome. But if you think about the cash yield that you're giving up, is that like a 6? Is that 5? Is that a 7? Because some of these things you've owned a long time with your basis being a lot lower, correct? Mark Parrell : Well, I'm going to \u2013 it's Mark. Just to ask a question. The 3.7 we quote you, the disposition yield is what we think forward cash flow is based on the price we sold it at. So it is what EQR would have gotten if we had kept these assets. So if you're talking about what our historic book value is, just to give you a sense of perspective because we just had this conversation with our Chief Accounting Officer, I mean, this company is very good at investing in apartments, so we have half the book basis or so of, I guess, compared to the actual sale price and most of that, the vast majority of that is in depreciation. It's actual gain on sale. So I don't know if that's helpful perspective to you, but the book value, it's fair to say is about half. But I'm not sure why the book value is terribly relevant. And the 3.7 is a good reflection of the cash flow EQR gave up. Is that helpful? Alexander Goldfarb : Yes, yes. That's \u2013 because obviously, you had an investment before, Mark, that was yielding you. It sounds like double the 3.7% that you're selling it. So I'm just trying to get that perspective as you're reinvesting the capital. Mark Parrell : Yes. I don't know about double because, again, you're failing to mark the asset to market. If you \u2013 I mean, we don't operate on a historic basis here. You don't look at an asset and say, it's only worth its net book value. It can be worth more or less. And in our case, it's often worth more. So I'm a little confused by the comparison of net book value using that as your denominator with cash flow as your numerator. I think cash flow forward is your numerator and your denominator is what you sold the asset for you think the asset is worth at the moment, right. Alexander Goldfarb : Yes, yes. You answered my question, so we're all set. Anyway, listen, thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Marty McKenna : Operator, do we have another question? Operator : We'll take our next question from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Anthony Powell : Hey, good morning. Question about renewals. You said that your renewal rates were among the highest they've ever been. I'm just curious, what do you think causes that to normalize? And does it matter to you? Do you prefer more renewals or less in the current environment? Michael Manelis : So this is Michael. I mean, clearly, we want retention, right. We deliver an outstanding customer service to our residents. We have a market price that we're using as a quote and we want our residents to stay with us. So as I think about that retention right now, you do have a couple of areas that the retention is super high, and that is probably being influenced by some of the regulations that's keeping some of those increases, call it, well below what the current market rate is, again. And that, to us, is just a deferral of the revenue into next year. But I think what you should expect to see is as the year goes on, I'm guessing we could see a little bit of that moderation on that retention or on that percent of residents renewing. But I don't think it's going to be material. I mean our residents are telling us, and you could see by the increases that we've been putting out there and they're signing with us that it's not an affordability issue. You may see a little bit of a tick up based on increase and then moving around. But I think we expect to see strong retention through the year. Anthony Powell : Got it, thanks. And one more for me on the cap rates on acquisition and disposition. I asked a few times on the call already. But do you expect to see some expansion in some of your sales activity and maybe some contraction than what you're buying? Or is it given what you talked about in terms of the capital coming into the space, do you expect to see continued low cap rates for even some of those for you target noncore sales that you're selling now? Alec Brackenridge : We're seeing flow cap rates kind of across the board. We're also a very tactical seller, right. So if a market has not got a lot of bids in a particular \u2013 last year, we didn't feel like New York \u2013 there was a lot of interest in New York. So we didn't sell. Now we're feeling differently. We have a property under contract, and we'll get a low cap rate on that. And but investor interest is broad across the markets, and we're going to continue to match sources and uses here with the dispositions paying for the acquisitions, as Mark said, at roughly the same cap rates. Anthony Powell : Right, thank you. Alec Brackenridge : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Rob Stevenson : Good morning, guys. Bob, what did you guys spend on new and recurring technology in 2021 that allowed you to have the AI and the self-guided tours and the negative on-site payroll growth? And what are you expecting to spend in 2022? Bob Garechana : Yes. So in fairness, and I'll let Michael chime in here. Most of the investments that yielded the results in 2021 related to the AI and other things were actually spent in prior years. There's a little bit of chicken and egg thing. So typically, what you see is investment in the overhead or technology like the AI, which by the way, was relatively inexpensive, I think, sub $1 million. You see that investment happen first as the enabler, and then you begin to see the reduction in the on-site kind of payroll or the change in the staffing. And so then when you move forward to 2022, we're in that position where we're once again in a phase of investment in the technology, and that's a lot of what our above-trend overhead growth that I alluded to in my comments is driven on. It's a lot of tech, it's some centralization of staffing, et cetera. So there's, call it, maybe $4 million or $5 million at least embedded in kind of the prop management growth rate. You're seeing some of that come out again in the 2022 numbers. But a lot of it is the investment into 2023 and 2024, and you've seen in some of our presentation decks, what we think the growth potential of that. When we make these investments that are going between geographies, just so you know, it's a very ROI-focused. Geographies don't matter, bottom line and cash flow do. And so what we look to do is to invest in technology or invest in centralization that gets a positive ROI overall regardless of geography. Rob Stevenson : Okay. Mark, anything incremental from a legislative, regulatory, ballot initiative perspective that you're worried about at this point that could have a significant impact, if enacted? Mark Parrell : Well, we're probably feeling a little better in a couple of places. I certainly think in New York, the new mayor seems to have been elected by a populist that wants practical problem solving government in New York and is thinking about the crime issue in a good, thoughtful way. So that's \u2013 we think that's positive. The governor has a lot of experience with real estate and understands how market factors work in real estate. So that \u2013 so probably feel smidge better in New York. I would say 1 thing in California, there will be an expiration shortly of a prohibition on local eviction moratoriums. And we do have some concern about that. I mean that is something we do think about. We think the time has passed for those sorts of emergency measures justified by COVID and that the system needs to adjust itself. And if there's going to be a need to keep people in homes of that sort, then the government should fund those kind of programs with enhanced vouchers or whatnot. But that's probably the thing that's foremost in our minds. And like I said, I think I feel a little better about New York, maybe not a lot, but a little in terms of the policymaking and then we'll continue to keep our eye on good cause eviction as well. And in some of our other markets, again, there seems to be more focus on quality of life and concerns of that sort, whether it's in Seattle or the city of San Francisco, and we welcome that as well. Rob Stevenson : Okay. And then one last one for me, Bob. What was the $17 million impairment charge in the quarter related to? Bob Garechana : Yes. So that related to a specific parcel of land and you can notice looking at our balance sheet, we don't have much land at all. But it related to a specific parcel of land in downtown Los Angeles that we no longer anticipate pursuing from a development standpoint. We obviously do a very thorough review of our land bank and all our assets from an impairment standpoint periodically and that change in intent is largely what drove that charge. Rob Stevenson : Okay, thanks guys. Bob Garechana : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Haendel St. Juste: Hey, there. Thank you. I just wanted to go back. I don't know if you \u2013 did you outline a time line for getting your portfolio to that kind of pro forma balance that you mentioned early in the call that one-third California, one-third the balance you outlined earlier. And then also, it looks like there's a bit more wood to chop in California. So maybe as part of that, can you talk about the level of demand and buy a profile that you're seeing in California. We keep hearing a lot of chatter that end is far less for close to California. I'm just curious on what you're seeing there? Thanks. Mark Parrell : Haendel, it's Mark. I'm going to start with the timing, and I'm going to leave Alec to talk about what's going on in the California sales side. So it will take a few more years. I mean, $2 billion is our goal on buys and sells. There was a lot of products sold towards the end of 2021. And so 2022 is not yet that busy, that's pretty common for the first quarter to be a little quieter. We'd love to do more than $2 billion, but we'll do only as much as makes sense on both the buy and the sell side. So I think you should expect this to take several more years to fully effectuate. But I'd say, in the meantime, the holders are going to get the benefit of the strong recovery in our established markets. And so again, we're going to continue to own a lot in New York, and New York is going to be a terrific market in 2022. And then you'll see our exposure to that market drop over time. And I think, hopefully, that will be well timed with improvements in performance in some of the Sunbelt markets that we're adding exposure. And so I think it is going to be a couple more years for sure until we get to that balance I've spoken of. Alec Brackenridge : And as to investor \u2013 and this is Alec. As investor interest in California, we see both newer transactions that we're typically looking at buying, and it's been a very full bidding tent for that. And also the older stuff that we're selling into such a slightly different buyer in many cases, more value-add focused. Also a lot of interest. The exception to that is really downtown San Francisco. There has not been a significant trade. And right now, I think the market has to continue to recover both from a rent level, which it's starting to do but also from investor appetite. It's somewhat analogous to New York, where 12 months ago, we felt the same way we needed to wait on that before we sold any property there. And San Francisco is a little lagging behind that, but that is the market where you just don't see much sales transaction. Otherwise, it's very robust. Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. Appreciate that. Mark, assuming you're open to fast-tracking that, should a portfolio present itself and you have identified use of proceeds? Or is this something you just want to manage a bit more rationally here over the next couple of years? Mark Parrell : I apologize. I didn't \u2013 that broke up a little. Would you repeat that question? Haendel St. Juste: I was asking you. Would you \u2013 theoretically, are you open to fast tracking that, the asset recycling out of California should there be maybe a portfolio... Mark Parrell : Absolutely. If there was an opportunity of that sort, we'd be all over it. But a lot of the portfolios we've seen that have traded or been offered for trade have all sorts of frailties. They're either a lot older product or they're in the wrong place or both. And they may have a few of the assets we want, but we're looking to try and make trades that move that goal along. Listen, we're open to buying assets, frankly, anywhere that makes sense if we get a great price. And this is not a market where you're getting a great price. So otherwise, you need to have it make sense relative to the strategy. So we'd love a portfolio acquisition. Alec and his team are super focused on that. We've not seen a lot of those opportunities that were in our wheelhouse come by. Haendel St. Juste: Great. One more question. A bit of a question, but just curious on your thoughts. I was intrigued by your reference to the Gen Z cohort earlier. Looking at the numbers, $65 million there large group but noticeably short of the $72 million of the millennial cohort that preceded it. So I guess just thinking ahead, I'm wondering at some point how this kind of plays itself out maybe in less demand or potentially less rate growth at some point. But also I'm curious kind of what have you learned about that cohort, maybe how they differ perhaps from millennials, and this is impacting anything on kind of like collection or services. And then as a follow-up, would you be enticed perhaps to do a bit more in the single-family rentership side as they appear to be more set up to be a beneficiary of the millennial, the aging of the millennials? Thanks. Mark Parrell : Well, there's a lot in there, and I don't know if some of the rest of the team might contribute to the answer. I mean I have two Gen Zers sitting in my house that I very much want to get out there launched. And we see that cohort as very large. And I think with \u2013 we hope sensible immigration policies. I'm not sure it will end up being much smaller or smaller at all than the millennial generation was. So besides the raw numbers, there's also what percent of those people are captured in the apartment rentership world versus home ownership or single-family rentership. And I think we're going to capture and continue to capture a fair amount of these millennials. I mean it's been well documented that a lot of those folks have pretty good P&Ls, pretty good earnings power. But not necessarily a lot of savings to put down the purchase homes. And so a lot of those folks are going to stay longer with us, and they value that flexibility from rentership. So our sense, and again, we've seen research on this is that even though the ownership percentages have been going up and millennials are certainly part of that, I think we're going to continue to have a pretty good share of that millennial population even as it ages. Our average renter is 33 years old in our portfolio. So it's a little older than some of our competitors. So I think we are still approaching the high watermark for the millennial generation in terms of the largest single year of population. So that all feels good. I think the runway for demographics and apartments is really good. In terms of going into the single-family business, we're a residential company. We think about all those things all the time. But what we have in front of us is this really good opportunity to build 12-or-so market portfolio in the best places for affluent renters to live in the U.S. We're really good at managing apartments, and we're good at that. We can be good at other things, too. But I think what we have in front of us is an opportunity to really trade out of some of the older product and maybe regulatory challenged product and move into apartments. That seems like that's right in front of us. I wonder if that isn't the opportunity for us right now as opposed to trying some new things, especially since those new things aren't cheap. So I think single-family is certainly analogous property type and plenty of our ex employees have worked there in pretty senior roles. So we know a fair bit about it. And we think about it a fair bit. But it isn't something that, from my perspective, is the immediate opportunity. Haendel St. Juste: Great. Well, listen, thank you for the time. Appreciate the thoughts. Mark Parrell : Thanks Haendel. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi. Michael Bilerman : Hey, it's Michael Bilerman. Mark, if we can just stay on this idea of the refined portfolio like it's about, let's call it, $6 billion or $7 billion of assets out of New York and California to rotate into that diagonal line starting up in Seattle. And I recognize $2 billion a year will take you through the three years. You've been selling a lot of assets outright. Have you given any thought or is there an opportunity to maybe do a fund or a larger joint venture because I would assume that there's a fair amount of capital out there that would like equity residential as an operator and just given your presence in these markets, owning 25% of an asset continuing to manage it is better? Or is your mindset, no, I just want to be out completely and not have a stub interest in the market? Mark Parrell : We're open to joint ventures. There are some places where we're probably more open to them. For example, the city of San Francisco with very high transfer taxes, maybe a place we're selling part is better. Selling twice as much in halves is better than selling one whole. So I guess, Michael, we are open to it. That's a different pocket of money. We have conversations. We know all those people. If an asset just needs to be sold, we want to sell it. We don't want to put a partner into an asset that we think will be challenged, but there are certainly assets we're just overexposed in the submarket and we just like to have a little less exposure. So we're open to that, and we've had those kind of conversations. But honestly, the market to sell 100% has been so darn good. We've just gone ahead and done that. But we're open to that. And the most important part of that is we found more to buy, then we'd like hit the switch on everything, JVs and larger portfolio dispositions and all of that. So the big limiter on doing one of those trades is all of a sudden, Alec, would get $600 million of cash that he need to reinvest in 90 days in a bunch of new great apartments. And that Michael, probably, concerns me most is how we would go about finding that new product, more than anything else. Michael Bilerman : I mean how do you think about, I guess, rather than selling assets, just growing the base? I know it takes longer to do. But there's an element that maybe just \u2013 you talked about your rents being back at peak levels, your stock is too, right? So your equity all of a sudden becomes attractive potentially. I don't know how you think about it to issue to grow rather than selling cash flow assets. Mark Parrell : Yes. Well, I mean, we do intend to grow. The development engine, we hope, will create some growth. We're open to the suggestion you made. It's again finding things to buy. If there was a lot to buy out there, Michael, and we might be very interested in using debt. We have a lot of debt capacity, maybe a little bit of equity and start buying, we'd love to get bigger. That's \u2013 we think this is a great time to be in the apartment business and would love to have both asset and cash flow growth. We'll get a lot of cash flow growth from just the existing business. So I'd tell you on both of your very good questions. The limiter is more our opportunity set not us wanting to pull those levers. We'll pull the JV lever, we'll pull the equity lever, if there was a lot of great things to buy. With it being such a tough market to acquire in, the trading activity has been probably a better way for us to go. Michael Bilerman : Right. And just as I think back to EQR history, as they've gone \u2013 as your company has gone through, different times of market repositioning going back to the 2000s and then obviously, the Starwood deal pre-pandemic, that put the company into six core markets. I guess are you thinking at all about a larger transaction, and I know it has to be available for you. But at least relative to some other times, you have culminated the market repositioning with a large \u2013 a much larger transaction versus this sort of just year-by-year methodology? Mark Parrell : And we'll react to the opportunity set that presents itself. I mean I appreciate the comment because you're right, we are transactionalists. We're good at doing large deals. We know how to integrate assets 50 at a time or more into the portfolio. But again, I don't see that opportunity set out there. So I guess it's hard to react in the abstract to that. But I'd rather be done with this process. That part, I agree with you. EQR would rather be done with the realignment process, but we're not in such a hurry that we'll do it by buying lower quality assets. Michael Bilerman : Okay, great. See you in Florida. Mark Parrell : See you there. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Joshua Dennerlein : Hey, guys. I just wanted to ask about a follow-up to an earlier comment where you spoke about same-store guidance ranges and you mentioned trend intra-period rate growth. Can you just remind me what the \u2013 kind of how to think about trend intra-period rate growth is and the seasonality? Bob Garechana : Yes. So if you think about kind of \u2013 and I'll use maybe 2018, 2019 is like typical, right. So typical for this business kind of trend would have been something in the high 2s, low 3s in terms of rent growth and it tends to start \u2013 you start a little bit in the first quarter. You build in the second quarter at the beginning of the lease season. You peak in the third quarter and then you typically have a little bit of a sequential rent decline as you get to the fourth quarter. So that would be a typical kind of pricing trend as you looked in other years, right. Now from a revenue standpoint, you're obviously not going to capture all of that because we talked about you don't write all your leases on 1 :1. You have \u2013 you maybe capture half of it based on the outlook, what I outlined in terms of actual revenue performance in a given year. So that's kind of what I think about in terms of trend. What we've assumed in our 2022 guidance is that we follow that kind of same shape of the curve but that is a little bit above trend, right, that we continue to see that strength and it is a little bit higher than trend. If that is much above trend, right, is something that is approaching more like the mid-single digits or even above, that's going to push your guidance range \u2013 your guidance results to the \u2013 or your actual results to the high end of the guidance range. If you're below that, call it, three that I was saying trend and you get kind of no growth, that will push you down towards the bottom end of the range. Joshua Dennerlein : Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate that. And then that 25 basis points drag from capital recycling, is that just a function of timing or maybe a difference in cap rates across what you're buying and selling? Mark Parrell : Yes, it's Mark. It's kind of just in our model. It can be either one. But like this year, we didn't have any. And our goal with Alec is to not have any again or for it to be accretive. But it can be from either. It can be from selling early in the year and thus having more disposition NOI gone or it could be from buying early in the year and having more accretion just by virtue of that. So either or, I guess, I'd tell you. You just take 25 basis points, multiply it by $2 billion that's the negative drag somewhere in EQR's P&L model on this activity. Joshua Dennerlein : Okay. Awesome. It sounds like a potential source of upside, last year you had none. So if I'm reading it correctly. Thanks guys. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. It appears there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Mark Parrell for any additional or closing remarks. Mark Parrell : Well, thank you all for your time today. We look forward to seeing many of you in person at the conferences that are coming up and in your offices over the next few months. Thank you very much. Stay well. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead. Marty McKenna : Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's first quarter 2022 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; and Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer; and Alec Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, are here with us as well for the Q&A. Our earnings release is posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Thank you, Marty. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our first quarter results. In a minute, Michael Manelis will walk you through a market update, and then we will take your questions. The growth in our business continues as evidenced by our first quarter performance. Demand is strong and lease rates are growing faster than we expected. While we are well aware of the recent increases in economic and geopolitical uncertainties, we continue to manage our business by focusing on our operation dashboards, not on the news headlines. Those dashboards continue to nearly universally flash a green signal as our well-located properties and excellent service attract our affluent renter demographic in droves, allowing us to retain a record number of our residents and push rents up nearly everywhere we operate. All of this allowed us to increase normalized funds from operations by 13% in the quarter and we expect this growth to accelerate over the next few quarters. As we mentioned in our March operating update, our first quarter same-store revenue results were negatively impacted by an increase in delinquency in Southern California. It appears to us that a relatively small number of Southern California residents, who had previously been good payers, declined to pay rent in order to apply for state rental relief funds. While we remain open to working with residents with true COVID-related hardships, this sort of behavior is not acceptable, and we will continue to work with these residents to obtain our full rental payment. Translating all this into the numbers, first quarter same-store revenue results were about 125 basis points lower than we anticipated due to these higher bad debt, partially offset by about 25 basis points of better rate growth, leaving the final quarterly same-store revenue number about 100 basis points lower than we expected when we gave you guidance back in very early February 2022. Normalized funds from operations in the quarter ended up being about $0.01 lower than we expected with a $0.02 per share or about $6 million hit from higher bad debt, offset by the better rate performance I just mentioned, and the better than expected expense performance that I'll discuss in a moment. As we think about the full year, we feel that we are in a stronger operating position than we had initially contemplated in our full year guidance with a better lease rate growth trajectory more than offsetting our now more cautious view of delinquency. Turning to expenses, our residents appreciate the increasingly seamless digital experience we are providing them, which in turn allows us to have a smaller and more focused property management team. As a result of these efficiencies as well as low property tax expense growth, we're able to deliver 2.5% same-store quarter-over-quarter expense growth in an increasingly inflationary climate. We look forward to continuing to drive innovation and to expanding our operating margins over the balance of the year, while creating remarkable experiences for our customers and for our employees. On the transaction side, as we expected, we did not have much activity in the first quarter. We purchased one asset in San Diego that we discussed in the release and after the quarter end, sold one asset in New York. With that, I'm going to ask Michael to fill you in on the operating details. Go ahead, Michael. Michael Manelis : Thanks, Mark. We are pleased to report that we are seeing pricing power ahead of our expectations. Strong demand is being driven by the desire of affluent residents to live in our well-located properties, both urban and suburban. We have talked in previous calls about the recovery in our business being connected more to the lifestyle that our residents crave and less to how many days workers are expected to be in the office and that pattern continues. I have visited several of our markets over the last few months, and I am excited by the vibrancy that I'm seeing. We reported 96.4% occupancy for the quarter, which is 140 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2021 and in line with our expectations. First quarter reported turnover of 8.7% was over 100 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2021 and represents the lowest reported turnover in the history of our company. This trend reaffirms the desirability of our product as our existing residents signed renewals at record levels with increases that averaged 11.9% in the first quarter. This trend continues into the second quarter with preliminary April renewal increases averaging 12.5% with approximately 60% of our residents renewing. We are limiting rate negotiations, given the strength and demand of new residents, willing to pay full price to live in our communities. As we begin our primary leasing season, we feel really good about our pricing position, which includes the near elimination of concession usage across the portfolio outside of Seattle and is translating into robust new lease change performance with April on track to deliver just over 17.5% new lease growth after posting over 15% in the first quarter. Now, let me give you some color on the markets. Beginning with Boston. Boston is following normal seasonal patterns with improving demand and pricing heading towards the spring. We're almost 97% occupied and the market is benefiting from the big college campuses being opened and the return of international students and workers and the continued strong demand drivers from lab and life sciences, financial firms, healthcare and education. Competition from new supply will be modest and market performance should be strong. New York continues to thrive and was our best performing market in the first quarter with same-store residential revenue growth of 13.6%. We're 96.9% occupied and continue to expect this market to be our best performer in 2022. Demand is robust. We're renewing about 60% of our residents, which is healthy, but 5% lower than at the beginning of the year. This is primarily due to deal seekers choosing to move out versus paying the higher current price. But it is not a concern since we are easily able to attract new residents at these higher rates. We still expect to feel some pressure from new supply on the Jersey waterfront and Brooklyn later this year. Washington, D.C. is performing as expected with residential same-store revenue growth of 3% in the first quarter. This market was our best performing East Coast market in 2021. And as I mentioned in the past has the least ground to make up. As is often the case in D.C. new supply is likely to pressure rate growth in the market that the metro area continues to boast record absorption. Strong employment across job sectors in the market is driving this demand and we are 96.7% occupied. We are renewing about 60% of our residents and feel good about our positioning for the spring leasing season. Before I talk about our West Coast markets, let me give you a little color on our expansion markets. Denver continues to demonstrate very strong demand, we\u2019re almost 98% occupied and delivered same-store revenue growth of almost 13% in the first quarter. Despite turnover being on the higher end, we are seeing very good pricing power and healthy occupancy. In Atlanta, our acquisitions are performing ahead of their performance as the market continues to produce strong rent growth. Dallas and Austin continue to enjoy robust demand driven by very good in-migration and job growth in these markets. Out of the West Coast, Seattle continues to be slow to recover compared to the other markets, particularly in the downtown submarket. The good news is that the city's new mayor is focused on the quality of life issues, which we expect will have a positive impact. Also job postings in the market are at the highest level we have seen with Amazon leading the pack with over 19,000 positions posted with 16,000 of them being in the city of Seattle, which is a good sign for future apartment demand. Market occupancy in Seattle currently sits just above 95%, which remains behind our expectations and turnover, albeit within historical norms was the highest of all of our markets. The suburban portfolio is outperforming the city with the Bellevue/Redmond submarket, seeing immediate demand improvement in March after Microsoft returned to the office announcement. Year-to-date pricing remains flat in the downtown submarket with approximately 60% of new applications receiving a concession at just over a month and occupancy in this submarket is at 93%. Overall, we expect continued strength in the suburban portfolio and remain optimistic that pricing power and occupancy will improve in the downtown submarket as we are just now beginning to see signs of increasing demand as the quality of life issues continue to slowly improve. San Francisco has also lagged the recovery, but at the moment, feels on stronger footing than Seattle. We are very encouraged by the recent announcements from Mayor Breed and the local large employers about a commitment to bringing office workers back to the city, which should help address quality of life issues downtown. There has been consistently good demand and early signs of improved pricing power that the market lacked in 2021, we\u2019re almost 97% occupied and resident retention has improved from a year ago. Google, which has asked workers to return this month made a recent announcement that it is investing more than $3.5 billion in California, including a big chunk in the Bay Area with significant projects in Mountain View, Sunnyvale and Downtown San Jose, all areas where we have a significant number of communities. Pricing trend has increased almost 6.5% since the beginning of the year, which is better than the normal seasonal expectations, which would be in the 4% to 5% range. While this market\u2019s pricing remains below pre-pandemic levels, the good news is that initial indicators point to a continued strong recovery of the market. Now let me move to Southern California, three markets that have performed exceptionally well, but for elevated delinquency. First, Orange County and San Diego continue to show remarkable performance with high occupancy and strong retention supporting very good new lease rents. Home prices in these markets are out of reach for many of our residents, which is evident by the significant decline of move out citing this reason during the quarter. We expect to see continued record high retention likely impacted by the local regulations, limiting our allowable increases, increasing home prices and very limited competitive new supply. The result of these factors should allow us to maintain elevated pricing power throughout the year in these markets. Next, Los Angeles. Even with elevated delinquency LA continues to be a star performer. The entertainment content creation business is really thriving and driving demand. Occupancy is almost 97% and pricing power is strong and better than expected. The urban markets performance is now on par with the suburban portfolio, a scenario, which we have not seen since the onset of the pandemic. The percent of residents renewing is the highest we have seen likely due to the impact of the local regulations limiting our allow renewal increases and we expect to continue to renew between 60% and 70% of our residents. Now that rent relief coverage is no longer available for April 2022 rents. We have seen an early uptick in payment activity, but remain cautious. I was in Southern California two weeks ago and I am very encouraged by what I saw. Our onsite teams continue to actively engage our non-paying residents and are just now beginning to see a few positive signs, either through payments being made or in some cases, residents deciding to move out and give us their apartments. Overall, the strength and demand and quality of our portfolio clearly points to above average performance for our Southern California markets as the delinquency issue slowly clears. On the innovation front, we finished deploying our centralized renewal process in the first quarter and are now focused on centralizing our application process. As we mentioned last quarter, the foundation of our operating platform is in place and we are focused on further process automation and multi-site coverage that will create additional efficiencies, while continuing to meet the ever-changing needs of our customers and provide them a seamless digital customer experience. Let me thank the entire Equity Residential team for their continued dedication and hard work. These are exciting times for our industry and the overall operations of our company. Not only are we on track to have a very strong year of financial performance, but we are also advancing our platform. Resident expectations are constantly evolving and our teams continue to focus on leveraging technology to meet those needs and drive operational excellence. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Nick Joseph with Citi. Nick Joseph : Thank you. Hoping to get more color on the Southern California delinquency issues. When did it first start to pop up? How many residents? Is it, how many are paying now and then is it kind of widespread across Southern California or is it concentrating specific buildings? Bob Garechana : Nick, it\u2019s Bob. I\u2019ll start with that. So we had about \u2013 we\u2019ve had concentration of bad debt in Southern California, as you mentioned. And in particular I think Los Angeles and the city of Los Angeles specifically. And if you drill down even a little bit further there\u2019s a handful of specific assets where it\u2019s even more concentrated. And that was true of most of 2021. It peaked in terms of severity in September of last year and then had pretty stabilized and started to improve slightly in the fourth quarter, which shaped some of our perspective in our guidance. What changed or what happened in the first quarter was you saw a little bit of an uptick in terms of \u2013 as Mark mentioned in the prepared remarks of residents, again, concentrated in those specific areas of about 300 more people that didn\u2019t pay. We believe that may have been driven by the fact that they were applying for more rent relief. But they had previously been paying and now they stopped. And so you went from that kind of increase overall. As you go into April and again, it\u2019s early and we haven\u2019t finished up the month as Michael mentioned. It appears that many of those people are at least starting to pay their April rent. Now what\u2019s changed also is that under the rent relief program, you could only have March eligibility. So rent that was through March of 2022 is eligible for the rental relief program. April is not. And so that probably is changing the behavior as well as some other opportunities we have to just communicate with residents, et cetera. Nick Joseph : Thanks. That\u2019s very helpful. And then Bob, can you just remind us the bad debt policy and then what guidance is assuming for net bad debt for the remainder of this year? Bob Garechana : Yes. So our bad debt policy in terms of our write-ups is once you get 3 times behind your rent, we would write or reserve against. And we also write-off any debt associated with people who move out. So there\u2019s that combination. Also if you were kind of 3 times, but got rent relief, so you weren\u2019t the actual payer. We also reserve against that. So it\u2019s a pretty conservative policy and looking at kind of what the residents themselves is doing from a payment standpoint. And that policy hasn\u2019t changed since kind of the beginning of the pandemic or even prior to that overall. And what was the second part of your question, Nick, other than the policy? Nick Joseph : What maintained 2022 guidance assumes from net bad debt? Bob Garechana : Yes. So our initial guidance back in January assumed that we would based on kind of our experience in the fourth quarter, to be honest with you, that I just mentioned thought that we would before rental relief start seeing improvement in the first quarter and then accelerate improvement, meaning more people paying or just moving out as we went through the remainder of the year. What happened based on the first quarter has made us adjust that perspective a little bit and that we still think that we will see the improvement, but it\u2019ll probably be less pronounced and it\u2019ll be further back in the year. Offsetting some of that change, so more impactful is the number offsetting. Some of that change is we now think we\u2019ll probably have higher rental relief, right? So based on what occurred to us. So net-net bad debt is probably going to be flat to maybe marginally helpful to growth between 2021 and 2022. Whereas, previously we had assumed that it would be a contributor to growth. The good news is that everything else that Michael talked about in terms of pricing and everything else relative to guidance is actually more than offsetting that like Mark mentioned. So we feel very good about how we\u2019re positioned going into the leasing season. Nick Joseph : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could just maybe speak to the June and July renewal increases that are being sent out to just help us frame against the April. And maybe how those numbers compare to when you set guidance several months ago? Where are those renewals and new leases in context of the revenue growth that you have currently out there? Michael Manelis : Yes. So, Steve, this is Michael. So first, basically when we\u2019re looking at renewals right now, we\u2019re not completely done issuing quotes through kind of July. But if we would just step back and look at where we are for April and May and even preliminary June, we\u2019re still putting out quotes that range somewhere between 14% and 15% for these months, which is probably about 200 basis points stronger than what we originally contemplated, which is just this intra period kind of strength that we see. We do expect that renewal \u2013 achieved renewal increase will moderate, especially on a net effective basis as we get into the back half of the year. Because when we look at even the July expirations, only 5% of our expirations for the month of July had a concession when they moved in a year ago. So I think that right there is going to put a little bit of pressure just on our ability to post 12.5% achieved renewal increases. But right now the overall performance and even what we see for the next 90 days probably trending about 200 bps higher than what we saw. Steve Sakwa : Okay, great. And I guess Bob, maybe just going back to the guidance. I mean I know the bad debt caught you guys by surprise and probably, certainly limited your desire at this point to kind of raise guidance. You see how things play out. But sounds like all the things Michael\u2019s talked about trend wise are definitely better than maybe what you thought at the start of the year. So, if this 125 or 100 basis point drag in Q1 really abates in Q2 and beyond. I guess, I\u2019m just trying to think through the potential upside to the numbers that you\u2019ve currently got out there. Like how much wiggle room do you have to kind of revisit guidance next quarter? Mark Parrell : Steve, it\u2019s Mark. We feel like we\u2019re extraordinarily well positioned. I mean, the team would actually tell you we\u2019ve never been in as good a spot. So we feel really good about that conversation we\u2019re going to have with you in July about where the numbers are going to go. But we are entering into the beginning of the leasing season. It\u2019s really hard to predict on the bad debt side. We may get more reimbursements, California may slow down. It\u2019s just really unpredictable. So the exact place we\u2019re going to end up, but do we feel like there\u2019s upside to numbers? Absolutely. Steve Sakwa : Great. And then just one last question on transaction. Just given the move we\u2019ve seen in the bond market in the last call it, six weeks, eight weeks. I\u2019m just curious, are you seeing unlevered IRR hurdles changing at all, levered buyers dropping out. Like I\u2019m just curious the transaction market, the dynamic that\u2019s out there with the sharp move in bond yields. And how is that influencing your desire to put capital out? Alec Brackenridge : Sure, Steve. This is Alec. You\u2019re right. The market has changed a lot in the last three or four weeks from an interest rate standpoint. But there are countervailing forces at work. There\u2019s still all this capital of flowing into our sector. And operating results are still so good. It\u2019s a really attractive place for people to put money. And so I would say more that the frostiness is gone, where a month or two ago we had multiple bidders going in and over ask and really bidding the pricing up. And frankly, we didn\u2019t buy in that environment, because we thought it got so overheated. So right now it\u2019s kind of a feeling out process. But I don\u2019t see distress sellers out there. Operations are really strong and there\u2019s still as I said, a lot of interest in buying it. So I don\u2019t see any fire sales coming and certainly not for us. And when you ask about cost of capital for us, that\u2019s really comes from our dispositions. And we expect to continue to be able to sell at low cap rates and redeploy that money non-delusively into our new expansion market. Mark Parrell : And Steve it\u2019s Mark. Just to build on that. I think very \u2013 already very complete answer. Interest rates right now that two year and 10 year treasury are just back to where they were in early to mid 2019. And I know you know this. We\u2019re not at some crazy new interest rate level. And yet our growth prospects are much better now for the industry, for our company than they were in 2019. Now a lot of that\u2019s been capitalized into the value of these assets being much higher now than in 2019. But I still think that growth picture, which doesn\u2019t have any fractures in it at all for us. And I think for most of the industry is very supportive of values. I\u2019ll also add, I think the private market is recognized and I think the public market is increasingly recognizing that apartments are very, very resilient. I mean, this pandemic was about the worst thing that could happen to an urban apartment owner. And yet we\u2019re 25 months out of the start of that and we\u2019re telling you about how well everything\u2019s performing, how well occupied we are again, how we\u2019re moving rents up. So I think the combination of the market\u2019s perception and the resiliency of the product, especially compared to all the volatility and other investment alternatives combined with just the growth prospects makes us feel pretty good about value going forward. And maybe that exception is if you get into a stagflation environment where the pressures would be a little different, but we feel pretty strongly that values are going to hang in there for us. Steve Sakwa : Great. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from John Pawlowski with Green Street. John Pawlowski : Thanks for the time. Alec, just a few follow-up questions to the transaction comments. So the dispositions you have teed up out in the market right now, could you just give us a little bit of color how the bidding intent for those assets has changed in terms of any rerating you\u2019re seeing or the number of bidders getting whittled down, particularly on the levered buyer side? Alec Brackenridge : Sure, John. So I would say at this point there\u2019s some bidders that are stepping back for sure. They\u2019re relying on higher leverage. It\u2019s harder for them to make it underwrite. But I can tell you that both what we\u2019ve been competing to buy and what we\u2019ve had on the market has seen a lot of interest. And then we see a lot of tours on stuff we\u2019ve just put on the market recently. And so far haven\u2019t seen a dramatic move in pricing. So really can\u2019t make a call on that. I would just say there is this feeling out sense that buyers and sellers are just going to determine whether there\u2019s a market right now. And at this point, it really feels like there will be, there\u2019s just so much capital out there. John Pawlowski : Okay. New York, specifically the additional sales that we can expect in the coming quarters, should we expect these low to mid 3% cap rates that we saw on 140 Riverside assets? Alec Brackenridge : Yes. That\u2019s generally been the case in the market and certainly for the properties that we\u2019re looking or thinking about selling. That would be generally the case. John Pawlowski : Okay. Thanks for the time. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Rich Hill : Good morning, guys. So I wanted to maybe talk about turnover for a second. I think on an annualized basis, you guys were just a shy below 35%. Do you think that\u2019s sort of the new normal? Or do you think that will pick up in the peak leasing season? And maybe more specifically, can you walk through what\u2019s driving sort of the collapse in the turnover rate. Is it really because there\u2019s no place to live and so people are just taking the renewals that you\u2019re giving them and saying, well, it\u2019s better than trying to find another apartment. Michael Manelis : Yes. Rich, this is Michael. So first just there is normal seasonality to turnover by quarter. So the first quarter typically is one of the lower kind of reported turnover numbers. And it will tick-up as you work your way through the leasing season and then kind of fall back off again in the fourth quarter. But the fact that we reported at 8.7% normal historical, like going back into 2018 and 2019 and even 2017, typically the first quarter is like right around 10%. So you could see that kind of improvement that we\u2019re seeing. My guess is that as we work our way through the second and third quarter, yes, it will tick-up, but it is still going to stay relatively low compared to comparative norms part of which is what you just said, which is the optionality, where are residents going to go? We\u2019re delivering great service to our residents. So our customer service scores are kind of maintaining at the all time high levels. The price point that we\u2019re offering is competitive in the marketplace. And there\u2019s still a little bit of this lift that we\u2019re seeing in retention regarding kind of just regulatory limits that we\u2019re bumping up against that is keeping some of these quotes while there\u2019s still significant increases below what the otherwise market price would be. And again, that\u2019s just a matter of time as we work our way through kind of another cycle of renewals with those residents that will catch up to those market rates. Rich Hill : Got it. And so what that tells me is, I know you\u2019ve emphasized this a couple times. But pricing power is significantly in your favor. And so if we\u2019re thinking about new leases and renewals, I have a hard time believing that there\u2019s very little that could lead that to start to roll over. Is that a fair assessment? And I have a quick follow-up to that. Michael Manelis : Yes. I don\u2019t know exactly what you mean by rollover. But I would tell you just looking at the strength of like the reported new lease, renewals and blended, right? Knowing where the intra period rent growth is today, we are going to produce stronger results in the second quarter than what we originally anticipated based on that strength. But we still have a difficult comp period as we turn the corner into the second half just based on the recovery of rents last year. So they will start to moderate off in the second half, but relative to our original expectations, strong early intra period rent growth is the biggest catalyst to produce revenue growth in the current year. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing right now. Rich Hill : Understood. That\u2019s helpful. I shouldn\u2019t have used rollover. I was asking a rate of change questions. So thank you for that. Could you maybe just talk about supply real quickly. Starts and permits across the United States are pretty high here. Do you think all those permits are going to become starts? And do you think those starts are going to be delivered on time? Alec Brackenridge : Rich, it\u2019s Alec. I\u2019ll start and others can chime in. But generally, there haven\u2019t been that many projects that have stopped at all that I\u2019m aware of, that we see in the market. But everything\u2019s gotten harder. So things are taking longer to deliver. So typically about a three month or so lag. So things that are in the pipeline will deliver a little more slowly. In terms of things that are being underwritten right now to generate future supply that\u2019s certainly gotten more challenging. It\u2019s a combination of costs going up. And costs that were going up say, 0.5% a month are now going up 1% a month. And even things like lumber, which may have abated a little bit are now being offset by steel going up pretty dramatically. So it\u2019s a cost challenge on top of which interest rates are up. So all of those things are going to combine to make development a little more challenging to underwrite in the future, we haven\u2019t seen that stop anything yet. But if you just look out it does get harder to make the numbers work. Rich Hill : Got it. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. Chandni Luthra : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. So I wanted to talk about rent control. The narrative has definitely heightened as we have seen sort of these staggering great numbers. So could you perhaps talk about what you are seeing in your circles? Not necessarily in the markets that you are in already, but just generally in the markets that you are planning to kind of expand your presence in? And how do you think the pars to be sold a housing crisis that rent control is being offered as one solution to. Mark Parrell : Thank you for that question, Chandni it\u2019s Mark. What I\u2019d say is that rent control continues to be a conversation, not just in the coastal markets as you implied, but also in places like Florida and other jurisdictions. Because again, as you noted, rents are up significantly. In some of our coastal markets, they\u2019re frankly just \u2013 these big increases are frankly just recovering the rents to where they were in 2019. In some places they\u2019re significantly higher, like in Southern California. So there\u2019s a little bit of that. We have had residents, especially our residents have their incomes continue to rise, which is an offsetting factor. But the biggest thing is we just need to keep as an industry focused and have these conversations with policy makers and in some cases voters about that rent control doesn\u2019t work. And we\u2019re doing that. The industry is very well organized on these topics. We continue to have these conversations. They\u2019re relatively productive. I mean, rent control just \u2013 New York set forms of rent control since World War II and it\u2019s the highest cost housing market in the country. I mean, it just doesn\u2019t work. And we\u2019re continuing to advocate for zoning reforms, continuing to advocate for regulatory reforms, public-private partnerships, like the 485w program in New York that we do hope gets going. So the industry is aware, we acknowledge the problem of a lack of affordable housing in the country. But that problem is a problem that is in some regards of the government\u2019s making and we need their cooperation here with some effective policies to improve. So we do see it as a risk. And one of the reasons you see our strategy diversifying is to diversify away from that risk. New York\u2019s a great market for us. It\u2019s going to have league leading revenue growth. Some of the assets we\u2019re selling, we intended to sell well before the pandemic for tax abatement reasons 421a type reasons or ground leases or whatnot, but it is also part of just diversifying into some markets that may be a little less political risk and having a company that can have a little less volatility and compound cash flows more reliably going forward. So we're really excited where we're headed, and this rent control topic does influence our capital allocation. Chandni Luthra : Thank you. Thank you for that insight. And if I could follow up with a question on seasonality now that you're entering your peak leasing season. Pardon my voice. What are you seeing from a seasonality standpoint? Is it typical? Is it still atypical? Any thoughts in terms of are we back to where you were versus 2019 seasonality patterns? Any color on that would be very helpful. Michael Manelis : Yes, sure. So this is Michael. So typically, in a normal year, the way to think about kind of transaction volume seasonality is about 20% occurs in the first and fourth quarter and about 30% occurs in the second and third quarter. We did see a little bit of a shift, right, as we were working our way through kind of the recovery in 2021. And right now, I will tell you, we are getting very close back to those normal kind of percentages by quarter. We did have slightly more expirations in the first quarter of this year. It was like 24% versus the 20% norm. But as we're working our way through these new leases and renewals, I think it's just a matter of time. By next year, we're going to be right back in line with those numbers. Chandni Luthra : Okay, thank you so much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : Thanks. I just wanted to go back to the bad debt number that you gave. I think you said, it was \u2013 $6 million was the uptick in bad debt versus what you expected. And I wasn't sure if that was \u2013 should we think about that $6 million is only applying to those 300 additional people that didn't pay that you cited in Southern California? Or is there other pieces within that $6 million? Bob Garechana : Hi, Nick, it's Bob. There's other pieces associated with it. It's probably about half of the 300 people that didn't pay that we mentioned earlier and the other half is, really we had anticipated improvement based on our fourth quarter experience, and we didn't see any improvement, right. So it's staying flat relative to our expectations that you were going to actually go down and then on top of it, adding these 300 people. Nick Yulico : Okay. Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then just other question is on, I know this is an issue that's probably going to play out in New York. I don't know if it's also in maybe in San Francisco or some other markets that had heightened concessions where you had some residents move into the portfolio over the last year and a half at the discounted rents when three months were given. Those leases, I think, in New York, we've just heard in the market increasingly are starting to turn in second quarter summer. And I guess I'm just wondering if you have any early read on how some of those conversations are going in terms of the resident who got a bunch of free rent is now being pushed up to market, and what's happening \u2013 the market itself is very tight, so maybe the person can move, but any sort of anecdotal color you're hearing on that topic would be helpful. Thanks. Michael Manelis : Yes. Hi, Nick. This is Michael. So I said something in my prepared remarks about in New York. In the first quarter, we were renewing about 60% of our residents versus like the historical norm from the fourth quarter and third quarter of last year. That was up at like 65%. So we did see a little bit of that drop off. And what we started to hear back in like late February, early March, as some of those folks from Manhattan were looking at those increases and actually choosing to go across the river into the Hudson Waterfront to trade down from a rent perspective. But given the strength of the demand that we see at the front door, I mean we are more than okay kind of with that trade-off occurring. And as we look into April, May and even like this preliminary June, it really isn't materially different. We still expect to renew a large percentage of our residents in New York, but we will allow some of that trade out. We centralized our renewal negotiation team, which really allows us to kind of be very strategic and tighten up kind of renewal negotiations to ensure that we're consistent in these markets. And right now, the results appear to be very consistent to us. Mark Parrell : And Nick, just to add, you might remember, we qualify everyone on the basis of their base rent. So they may have gotten a one or two month concession from us, but they can afford to pay that face rent. So they may react to any increase above the face rent, but the disappearance of a one month concession on our financial statements is an 8% increase in revenues, but they've been paying us 11 months' worth of that higher face rent. So for them, there's no change beyond what Michael and his team pushed above face rent. So again, it will look a little different on the financial statements than it will to the resident at hand. Michael Manelis : But we really are at the tail end of this because the concessions really ramped down last year. So by the time we hit July, there's very few of those residents that had those big concessions when they came in. Nick Yulico : Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Brad Heffern : Hi, good morning everyone. You mentioned in the prepared comments a decline in residents moving out to buy a home in San Diego. I'm curious if that's a trend that you've seen across the rest of the portfolio as well. Michael Manelis : Yes. So during the first quarter, we did see a decline in the percent of residents that site buying home is the reason when they move out. Remember, the turnover was low. So the absolute number of residents leaving to go buy home is materially down, and the percentage ticked down to about 11.5% of move out citing that reason pretty much in line with our historical norms of like an 11% to 12%, but reduced from like the 15% that we were seeing in the fourth quarter and third quarter of last year. I think right now what you're starting to see is just the supply constraints, the cost of single-family housing in our markets, rising mortgage rates, we expect that is going to keep this percent at a very low end, which really eliminates pressure on move-outs from this reason going forward. Mark Parrell : And because renewals are so high, the absolute number of people actually moving is really small. I mean when you talk about a percentage, that's one thing, but the 10% or 11% is being applied against a much smaller number of people that are, in fact, leaving us at all for any reason. Brad Heffern : Okay. Got it. And then have you seen any change in demand for one bedrooms versus two bedrooms? I'm just trying to see if people are starting to double up again given the increase in rates. Michael Manelis : Yes. So \u2013 this is Michael. We really haven't seen kind of any change right now. We're back to like a pre-pandemic levels where we average about 1.7 adults per kind of occupied unit in the portfolio. What I will tell you is, what we've seen is through the pandemic studios were the lowest occupied unit type that we had. I talked a little bit that we were seeing the trends of the recovery in the portfolio of that unit type. But even sitting here today in the first quarter, studios were 95.9% occupied, and today, they're at 96%. So they're still trailing the other unit type mix, which if we're going to have vacancy in the portfolio, I'm okay with that vacancy being at the lower price point unit of a studio. Brad Heffern : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Thank you. You have a fair amount of debt expiring this year and next. There is no debt offerings in your guidance. What are your thoughts of refinancing some of that debt with equity given your implied cost of equity is lower than your long-term cost of debt? Bob Garechana : So I'll start with the debt maturity real quick and then maybe Mark and I will tag games. So this year, we don't have much debt maturing, John, actually. And then next year, we have the bigger amount of the $1.3 billion or so, some of which is secured and for various structural reasons needs to maintain secured. And then we literally have no debt maturing at all in 2024. So when you look at the profile over the three year time horizon, it's a pretty average to below average kind of maturity profile. And we have lots of flexibility in the markets, at least in the debt markets to refinance, whether that's shorter dated, longer dated, fixed, floating, secured, unsecured, kind of the full access to the capital. Our leverage is also very low relative to kind of targets and other things, and it will be continue to be low, particularly as the recovery and just the overall business performance is great. So \u2013 and maybe I'll let Mark talk a little bit about the equity side. Mark Parrell : Yes. And just thinking about cost, I appreciate the point that the sort of FFO yield as compared to interest rates may be lower, but the long-term cost of adding partners, which is effectively what equity is to the company. And when you have all of this, as Bob said, additional debt expansion capability, when you have all this additional availability on the debt side, that seems to us to be dilutive at this point. I don't feel like the stock is trading above our NAV estimates internally. So again, that doesn't seem to us to be the best idea right now relative to just refinancing. And I think Bob and his team have done a good job of giving us a multitude of options. I mean we can go short. It doesn't have to be 10-year debt. Almost 20% of our debt was issued at 30-year maturities and expires in 28 years or more. So we've got the whole curve to use. We have 5% floating rate debt. Maybe we'll float some debt for a little while on the line. So I think we can manage this increase in rates pretty well without having to issue equity that I appreciate might feel cheaper, but to us kind of doesn't. John Kim : Okay. And Mark, you mentioned some of the reasons for selling more New York assets and deemphasizing the market. Has a strong rebound in the rents in New York giving you any possible reconsidering this? Mark Parrell : Yes, now, thanks for that question. I think we're really, to your point, kind of in an enviable position in New York. We got great properties and a great team running them, and the assets we're potentially going to sell and have sold have been assets that have had these ground lease accounting issues, have had these 421-a tax reassessment increases that are coming up in the near term that maybe have more intensive renovation plays that maybe aren't our thing to do or we \u2013 aren't things we believe in, but buyers would. So we're keeping the assets that we think are going to drive performance. We're going to have this, and we'll continue to have this amazing New York portfolio that will benefit from, I think, very limited supply from some good job growth. So I think owning New York the next couple of years is going to be great. I think it has to be balanced against these regulatory concerns. So this didn't change our mind on New York. This is something we wish we had sold some of these assets in the past, but the pandemic interfered with that, and we waited for them to recover. And now our investors are going to harvest those gains, and we're going to help with our diversification place to let the company is a little more balanced against some of these regulatory pressures. So \u2013 no, it doesn't make us reassess our position, but I mean we're really pleased on what we own in New York and what we'll own long-term. I think it will be a big driver in the next couple of years. John Kim : I appreciate it. Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Mr. Anderson, please go ahead. Your line is open. Rich Anderson : Apologies, on mute. So on the topic of guidance and your decision not to raise it, two of your peers did this quarter. You had done it last year at this time. So I don't think it's a policy thing for EQR. I'm just curious, is it entirely the unknowns around bad debt that caused you to hold the line? Or were there other factors behind your decision to wait until next quarter to reassess guidance beyond just the bad debt issue? Mark Parrell : Hi, Rich, it's Mark. Last year was a year like no other. So I would say, saying what our behavior is off of last year, we were \u2013 we had \u2013 really challenged trying to figure out guidance. Other folks didn't even bother giving guidance in 2021, and we at least told you where we thought the business was. And then, obviously, the recovery was really vigorous. In 2019 and 2018, we didn't raise at the April mark. So it is kind of our general view here since I've been here in 2007, not to do much in April. And the reason for that is we try to give you a real hard good look when we issued guidance early in February. I mean the other guidance changes really took the numbers to our range. We had the highest range. So again, that was only a couple of months ago and there just isn't enough time in the period. I mean we think we gave you a pretty high-quality estimate. For everyone's portfolio is different, everyone's process is different. But I think we started off with a higher number, so we don't have to adjust it in April. And we're sort of looking at July and going at that point, we'll have a real good sense of where the leasing season is going. We will \u2013 we hope, adjust the guidance ranges appropriately, but it isn't just a matter of you do it, you create guidance ranges so you can definitely raise every quarter, that isn't our goal. Rich Anderson : Okay, fair enough. I appreciate that. Second question is you and your multifamily peers have been kind of gifted with this incredible environment. And we can all see what 2022 is going to look like, and I hate to say it, but the conversation is going to shift to 2023 really soon here. I'm curious, what you're doing differently, given this unprecedented level of growth that you're enjoying? And how that might be influencing longer-term plans? I doubt EQR, given the quality of the organization is, just taking the money and running and hoping for the best in 2023. Is this causing you \u2013 this environment causing you to maybe do things a little bit differently so you can lock in some of this growth for next year and thereafter maybe longer-term leases? I don't know what it would be, but I'm just curious if there is a change in strategy so that you can extend the lifeline of what's happening today. Mark Parrell : Maybe we'll split that up into two pieces. On the operations side, this custom of one year leases is so deep in our business that it's really hard, Rich, for us. I mean in New York, we have to offer two year leases, and we just don't have a lot of uptake on that, and we haven't seen a lot of uptake on that anywhere in the country. So it's an interesting idea, and we've tried that before, and we just have not had a lot of progress on that. So on the operations side, I think all the things we're doing in Michael's world to manage expenses better because this inflationary pressure on payroll is real, and it isn't going to abate. And I think that is part of the 2023 conversation, and that I think it's something we're working really hard on. And we're making good progress, and you can see that in our numbers. So I think as we think about 2023, 2024, 2025, we're thinking we're going to live in an inflationary climate for a while, and we need to adjust to that by managing our people and processes as best we can. On the transaction side, the blessing here is that we're able to do this trade. I would have loved to have done it accretively. It was a little accretive last year, but we're able to switch into these new markets, much newer product, much less capital-intensive product without dilution is a wonderful thing, and we're taking full advantage of that. So the opportunity to sell product that's older product in markets that do have real regulatory challenges that we think a lot of private owners aren't that concerned about because they've got other things on their mind, that's an opportunity from our perspective. And we're selling into that opportunity. Rich Anderson : Okay, fair enough. See you in New York. Mark Parrell : Yes, thank you. See you there. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Joshua Dennerlein : Yes. Hi, everyone. I appreciate all the market color on the beginning. Just curious on the LA market. It looks like year-over-year same-store revenues were up 8.6%. What would that have been if you backed out the delinquency impacts? Bob Garechana : Yes, that would have been a little over 200 basis points better. So something that would have been around, not dissimilar to what the reported Orange County in kind of San Diego were so like 11-ish percent. Joshua Dennerlein : Okay. Okay. That makes sense. And then, Michael, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're working on, if I heard correctly, centralizing your \u2013 the application process. What's the benefit EQR expect to derive from this? Is it more on the expense front or better able to kind of drive revenue growth or something else? Michael Manelis : So it is \u2013 this is Michael. So it's really \u2013 it's just part of the overarching plan of just centralizing a lot of the on-site kind of tasks into a group where we can create that operating efficiency and running assets with fewer kind of folks in the office and really getting more into this multisite coverage kind of model. So that's really the biggest thing, which is layering in. We started with renewals. We saw the immediate benefit to kind of being able to create the guardrails and negotiation. Now we're looking at this application processing and creating efficiencies in that process and having fewer people having to be touch points with that and creating more of that seamless kind of experience kind of for prospects as they're going through, and then we'll move into kind of the evictions and delinquency. So we're looking at every single thing that gets done on site and saying is there an opportunity and benefit to the organization to streamline that process and have fewer touch points with it. And that's really the essence of what we're doing right now. Joshua Dennerlein : Awesome. Thanks for the time. Operator : We'll go next to Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Haendel St. Juste: Hi, there. So a couple of questions for me. First, Mark, maybe another one on transactions, but from a different angle. I know the transaction can be lumpy, but I guess I'm curious what the strategy you're thinking today here is? It's almost May and you've only done about $100 million of acquisitions, $200 million on the disposition side, well behind the $2 billion annualized pace. Like the questions and comments, if you're waiting for the market to settle down a bit here? Are you looking to perhaps sell a bit more aggressively now and buy more later given the surge in interest rates, anything under LOI today? So maybe some color on how you're thinking and maybe how we should think about maybe the pace of acquisition dispositions and if you have anything under LOI or far along today? Alec Brackenridge : Hi, Haendel, this is Alec. The whole market kind of took a pause at the beginning of the year, just because it had been so busy at the end of 2021. And certainly we were part of that. We closed literally five deals in the last two weeks of the year. So the whole market kind of took a break and then it started back up again, really in February. And from our perspective, I alluded to earlier, it was super frothy, really a lot of bidding wars going on, we were part of the process but we didn't feel like it was the time to step in, lean into that. Now the market seems to calm down a little bit. I think there's going to be an opportunity for us to get back on pace. And last year, where we bought \u2013 we sold 1.07 billion and bought a 1.07 billion. We didn't do anything in the first quarter either. So picking up to that pace is certainly our goal and certainly my job to make that happen. And we are pricing very actively right now. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. Fair enough. A question may be on the market, based on your comments this quarter versus last quarter. It seems to me that San Francisco might be the market where, which is perhaps standing out most in terms of expectations at the start of year versus now putting the bad debt issues in LA aside, obviously. So I guess I'm curious one is that fair and maybe what your sense of the market same-store revenue potential today in San Francisco versus kind of the 7% you outlined a few months ago? Michael Manelis : Yes. So this is Michael. So I think the way I would look at this right now, if I think about intra period rent growth, the markets that I kind of alluded to in my prepared remarks that are really kind of outperforming expectations of New York, San Francisco and LA, relative to San Francisco right now, you're just now starting to see some of that pricing power come back. So from our full year expectation, that was probably a seven at the beginning of the year, it's like a 50, 60 basis point improvement right now to the full year projection. But I think what I said in my prepared remarks is I'm more excited because we're seeing that pricing power improving week after week. So sequentially right now, we have a great opportunity as we head into May and June to write a lot of leases at a rate higher than what we otherwise thought, which would then add to those numbers. Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Fair enough. Can you give us an updated loss to lease quote for the portfolio? Thanks. And that's my final question. Michael Manelis : Yes. So as of April 15, the portfolio loss to lease remains at 11% for all leases in place. So really it's the strength of this intra period rent growth that has allowed us to maintain this loss to lease at a very high level sitting here in April, even though we just captured a whole bunch of it in the first quarter through this renewal and new lease process that you can see when you look at that blended rate that we reported for the quarter. So I think right now in the portfolio, there's 85% of the leases that are in place that are below current market pricing. And I think as we mentioned in the past, we're not going to be able to capture this full 11% this year, but the fact that this number remains 11% and is higher than what we otherwise would have expected it to be in April, really does put us in a great position for the portfolio, not only to contribute into 2022 revenue, but position it for 2023 to have stronger embedded growth. Haendel St. Juste: That's great color. Thank you. Operator : And next, we'll go to Connor Mitchell with Piper Sandler. Connor Mitchell : Hi, thank you. So how soon can EQR turn the delinquent tenants over to the credit agencies? Michael Manelis : So this is Michael, so there's a lot of nuances to that. So for residents that have moved out that have balances with us, we are able to turn them over to a collection agency now and they can begin that process. There's periods of protected rent. So it's not as clean as is what it would've been a pre-pandemic period. What we are started to or what we've started to do in April is we are credit reporting now for folks with their April rent payments. And that's something that really kind of the law shifted around and we were able to kind of have that ability. So we are now reporting to the credit agencies each and every month, our residents ability to pay rent and any balances that they owe. Connor Mitchell : Okay, thank you. That's helpful. And then as EQR moves into the Sunbelt and non-coastal markets, the expansion markets, are you seeing any different affordability dynamics? Alec Brackenridge : Hi, Connor, it\u2019s Alec. When you say affordability about \u2013 affordable units on site or are you just saying generally about\u2026 Connor Mitchell : Is it rent as a percentage? Alec Brackenridge : Okay. Rent as a percentage of \u2013 no, we're keeping in track generally low 20% rent is a percent of income and as we've talked about in the past, we're really finding the same general kind of renter who's working in the same general knowledge based industries. And has a growing income that supports rent growth over time. Connor Mitchell : Okay. Yes. Thank you. Sorry, if there was any confusion. So yes, I was really asking about if tenants are willing to spend more kind of the percent that you're talking about and then, compared to other markets like San Diego, that's been touched on a few times. Alec Brackenridge : So one of the dynamics is that we're growing off of a lower rent base as well so if the average rent is 2500 versus 4,000, we like that spot for a renter who has a good income. Mark Parrell : We can take the next question, operator. Operator : Thank you. Moving on we\u2019ll go to Anthony Powell with Barclays. Anthony Powell : Hi, good morning. A question on Los Angeles, you cited streaming content creation as a source of strength. There's been talk about some of the streaming providers cutting down their content spend given the competitive market there, how much frankly was driven by content creation. And how do you see the overall demand generators in LA? Michael Manelis : Yes, so this is Michael. So I think \u2013 well, one, some of the announcements that you're reading today is probably more going to be impacting the future into like a 2023. The demand in the LA market is really strong. I don't quantify like how many applications came to us from that content creation, but you can look at like the strength in West LA and really just the overall kind of inbound leads that we're seeing in the overall LA market. It's really strong on a year-over-year basis. And that's just one component of the strength of that market to generate demand. But I think the announcements that we've just saw in the last week or so really way too soon to understand if it's any impact on the future demand. Mark Parrell : And you got to feel bullish about entertainment in general, how people will consume it has changed. I mean, many of us were older like me consumed it through network television. Now you're consuming it through streaming services and there may be a different way to consume entertainment, but LA as the one of the worldwide centers of the entertainment industry, that's a very powerful economic magnet. And again, even if streaming kind of does withdraw a little bit and maybe there are tighter budgets there, you may have more people going entertainers going direct to the audience, in a TikTok type format and needing production services for those sort of things outside of the streaming industry. So I just think entertainment can be consumed a lot of different ways, but I think LA has a central role and how that's all done. And I think one way or another will benefit from it, even if sort of some of the streaming stuff, these very elaborate productions become a little less. Anthony Powell : Got it. Thanks. So maybe one more on rent to income. You said that it's still in a low 20, so there's really been no movement there even as you push rents higher. And how do you look at rent to income in an inflationary environment? Would you maybe like see a bit lower given there could be some other cost pressures outside of rent that may be impacting certain renters? Alec Brackenridge : Well, this is Alec. I mean, I would say our typical renter is also seeing their income going up pretty aggressively as well. So you see that particularly within the profile that we typically rent to. So that is keeping pace. Bob Garechana : Yes. And at the overall portfolio, I mean, we're at 19.5% rent as a percent of income. And really when you look at move-ins from the first quarter, the only change that happened was New York that used to be the absolute low point at 17.5% ticked up to 18%, which still shows that from an overall affordability standpoint, those residents are going to be able to absorb additional increases. Mark Parrell : And it's Mark, just to add a little to that, because this is important in the inflationary climate. And we had a lot of \u2013 we've had a lot of good conversations with investors about this point too. Our higher end rent are paying call it 20% of their income to us in rent with a lot of those folks commuting by public transit especially in the East Coast are less susceptible to some of these energy pressures because they are higher earners. They have more disposable income. So even if their energy and food costs are up, they're liable to be pinched less. I think the pressure implied in your question is more likely to incur \u2013 occur, pardon me. In Class B apartment buildings, in apartment properties in more further suburbs maybe in the SFR sector where people are a little more stressed than our renter. Anthony Powell : Got it. Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : And next, we'll go to Omotayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse. Omotayo Okusanya : Yes. Good morning, everyone. Hate to go back to the bad debt question. But I'm curious, why did this happen? Just particularly in LA, if the extension was kind of done statewide through June 30, why is it only happened in LA. And then by June 30, when the protection is all kind of come off, do we kind of expect kind of a repeat of what we just kind of saw in 1Q? Michael Manelis : Yes. So this is Michael, maybe I'll start and then others can kind of build in. So I think when you look at the concentration of our delinquency, it has been Southern California focus, but LA has always had the highest concentration of the overall delinquency in the portfolio. What we also saw early on into January is we saw rent relief payments actually slow down in January and February, as the programs were very focused on working on first time rent relief applications and really put everything that they call like a re-certification residents that were coming back for more. They put those kind of on hold. Now what we saw in March is they basically started to work those cases and net-net for the whole quarter, we came out right around where we thought we were going to be, but you can really look into April right now and look at this rent relief volume that we're seeing. And we're already over $5 million for the month of April. So you can see these programs catching up. So the concentration in LA is probably just due to the fact that is where the delinquency is. And there's also a lot of publication around these rent relief programs, in that market that kind of influences the behaviors of the renters there. Mark Parrell : Yes. And it's Mark, I'm going to add a little to that. Because I think there is another regulatory impact that Michael alluded to there. I mean, in the city of Los Angeles, there is an eviction moratorium. I mean that still exists. There's exceptions to it. There's different actions we can take. I think residents have been diluted into thinking that means they don't have to pay their rent. When in fact, as Michael said, we can do other things to affect their credit and have other more pointed conversations. So I think in some places a moral hazard has been created by these, I think initially well intended, but now well overdue policies. And I think that's part of it. I think the reason you see it a little more in Southern California than in Northern California is because of that. And I think you \u2013 if these programs get extended, I think you're going to see very much more effective legal challenges to them because we're 25 months into the pandemic and all these emergency measures have expired. And the idea that this is the one measure that needs to keep going and that this cost needs to be put on landlords, as opposed to dealing with the housing crisis as a public good, that needs to be dealt with. I don't understand how that's going to work. I think there's going to be pressure on policy makers on that topic. So I think it's a combination of a little moral hazard, a little regulatory mischief, as well as just I think some PR in that market. Omotayo Okusanya : But what it does expire June 30, do you think the people just kind of stop paying? What do you expect to shock to the system at that point? Mark Parrell : Our resident base is different. Yes. Our resident base is \u2013 we don't, I mean, this is troubling to us. Sure. But it's not deeply material. We just don't have a lot of evictions. I think we need to just keep having conversations with residents. There's no rent for giving this program at EQR. We will continue to pursue, we'll follow the rules, but we will be persistent. So I guess I'd say that we're going to advocate that these various eviction moratoriums have served their purpose and now should lapse. And we'll continue to have these direct conversations with our residents and a vast majority of them are paying and paying on time and like their service and like their property, but you can't live for free and you need to meet your financial obligations, meet your contractual obligations. And that's something we'll be diligent in following up on. So I guess I'd say to you, I think it is going to get better, and it's probably going to get better slower in LA than anywhere else. Omotayo Okusanya : Great, thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Moving on, we'll go to Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Michael Goldsmith : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. First quarter operating metrics such as same-store revenue growth and same-store NOI growth, we're below the low end of the full year range for reasons already discussed in depth. But how should we think about the pace of the acceleration of these metrics through the year and given the tougher comparisons in the back half, when does this peak or trying to get an updated view of the shape of the year and the exit rate into 2023? Thank you. Bob Garechana : Yes. So this is Bob. So the shape is actually not changed all that materially, even with the negative impact on the first quarter from bad debt. So the first quarter was always in our mind going to be lower because you're getting this compounding effect of the rent roll, right. You're getting this compounding effect of like putting on these great new lease changes, great renewal rates, great blended piece. And so in our mindset, really Q2 and Q3 are going to be probably the peak above kind of midpoint, a full year guidance range performance from a same-store revenue standpoint that has to do with the comp period, right. And just kind of the comp period trajectory from Q2 and 21, but also just that compounding effect. And we felt like in our original guidance that you would then see more normal seasonality in the fourth quarter as you went into the fourth quarter. And so you'd see a little bit of a dip there. The question will be given where we sit today about how strong the leasing like the lead up to the leasing season is if that normal seasonality returns are not, right. We've had years where we've defied that normal seasonality. The setup, again, sitting here today feels like that normal seasonality might not be as pronounced as what we assumed in our initial guidance. So that feels pretty good. But I think we'll know more in July when we talk to you on the call and we'll be able to give you kind of a robuster view on that. Michael Goldsmith : That's very helpful and you've invested in technology initiatives and you still have higher than usual staffing vacancies. I'm just kind of wondering, when do these higher vacancies just become the norm and based on your investments, you kind of reached a new equilibrium between technology and employment levels. Michael Manelis : Yes. So this is Michael. So in terms of staff vacancies on site, right now, the portfolio is running just below 7%, which is about a 100 basis points higher than what historically we see in the first quarter. It is nowhere near like what we saw in Q3 of last year, where we were like 10%, 11% kind of vacant positions on site. So a lot of that vacancy kind of has evaporated through recruiting efforts and really all of the work that we're doing right now around the centralization and creating these operating efficiencies, like we're still in the early innings of all of this coming through. And I think I've said in my prepared remarks, even last quarter that this stuff is going to go and flow into 2023 as well because we're redoing a lot of the onsite processes. But again, and a lot of the gain that you see in payroll is not from vacant physicians in the first quarter, it's from the efficiencies that were created. Michael Goldsmith : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And there are no further questions, I'd like to turn it back to our presenters for any additional or closing comments. Mark Parrell : Thank you all for your time on the call today. We look forward to seeing many of you in conferences and in your offices over the next few months. Stay well. Thank you. Operator : And that does conclude today's call. We'd like to thank everyone for their participation. You may now disconnect.",

In a minute, Michael will walk you through a performance update by market, then Bob will discuss our guidance improvements, update you on how our innovation machine continues to hold expense growth down in an increasingly inflationary world, and then Bob will close with some color on our balance sheet and then we will take your questions. Equity Residential had a tremendous quarter. Our business continues to benefit from terrific supply and demand dynamics, including excellent job growth and household formation. Our urban and dense suburban portfolio continues to be a magnet for our affluent renter demographic as demonstrated by our 96.7% same-store physical occupancy. We also believe that the desire for more space due to work from home and COVID-related health concerns has resulted in significant incremental household formation, creating additional demand for our properties. Also, housing alternatives remain expensive and in low supply. Single-family home prices reached record levels in 2022 while rising mortgage rates have further stressed affordability, particularly for first-time homebuyers. Single-family housing starts are declining. Existing homeowners are more reluctant to sell due to low locked in mortgage rates, along with minimal and expensive for sale replacement options and competition for homes from investors remain strong. The near-term apartment supply picture also remains favorable. Starts within close proximity to our properties in our coastal markets are still at or below pre-pandemic levels. In addition, it seems likely to us that over the next few quarters, new apartment starts should decline due to reduced availability and higher pricing of construction financing, increasing construction costs and continued supply chain disruptions, lengthening construction times and increasing developer risk. Recently elevated inflation numbers are certainly a concern, especially if efforts to rein in inflation lead to much weaker job growth. On the positive side, our affluent renter base should be able to better weather rising inflation in part due to lower relative rent-to-income ratios and higher amounts of disposable income. As in the past, if inflation does persist, we would expect the apartment business to perform relatively well. As we look at our resident income, the average incomes for our residents who sign new leases with us in the last 12 months is 13% higher than the group who signed with us in the 12 months ended June 2021. These new residents are paying us approximately 19.8% of their incomes versus 19.2% last year in rent. They are not rent stressed and they are willing to pay these rents to live in locations that support the lifestyles they seek to enjoy. On the larger topic of affordability, we see a continued need for more workforce housing and continue to support market-based affordable housing supply solutions, including zoning reform, public-private partnerships and other programs that assist in affordable housing preservation and creation. As part of this support and in addition to the more than 2,600 apartment units that we already operate in affordable programs, we have funded about half of our $5 million commitment to a privately held affordable housing preservation fund that expects to preserve approximately 1,600 affordable housing units when it\u2019s fully deployed. Now, switching gears to the investment side of our business, we saw a material slowdown in the transactions market during the quarter. Higher interest rates, especially for the floating rate debt used by many value-add buyers as well as general uncertainty about the path of the economy and evaluations led most buyers to pause. We did recently close on the sale of 2 properties in New York, 1 property for $266 million at a 3.3% disposition yield in the second quarter, and another New York property for $415 million at a 3.4% disposition yield this month. The properties are adjacent to each other on the Upper West side. Both properties represent pricing contracted for before the recent volatility in the apartment transaction market and our continuation of our stated strategy of lowering our New York market exposure. As we have said before, we will continue to have a meaningful exposure to the New York area, but intend to better balance our urban versus suburban exposure in our established markets like New York, while adding over time to our exposure to our expansion markets, which are attracting increasing numbers of affluent renters and have lower regulatory risks. For our part, we are very comfortable letting the transaction market sort itself out and have reset our transaction guidance so it reflects only buys and sales completed to-date plus one smaller disposition that is under a long-term contract that should close in the fourth quarter. While apartment values are not immune from the more general revaluation of risk assets going on across all asset classes, we expect apartment assets to remain in high demand from institutional buyers and for rising NOIs to partially cushion increases in cap rates. We have the balance sheet and the team ready to take advantage of any opportunities we do see as we have done in the past. Moving on to development, we started two new developments in the quarter. The first project is $153 million densification of an existing property we own in Santa Clara, California, about 1.5 miles from Apple\u2019s headquarters. We will be demolishing 40 units in buildings built in 1972 in a highly desirable area, with little supply of high-quality rental housing and replacing them with 225 new units plus significant amenities that will benefit the remaining 224 units at the property that are undergoing renovation. We are very excited about this project and expect a 6% development yield when it stabilizes. At a cost per unit of about $675,000, we also like our basis as compared to recent sales comps. We are also pleased to have started this quarter, our first development project with Toll Brothers. This $82 million, 362-unit project is being built just west of downtown Fort Worth, Texas in a rapidly gentrifying area with good access to job centers and to the increasing number of nearby lifestyle amenities like restaurants, bars and entertainment venues that are appealing to young well-off renters. We expect to build this property for about $225,000 per unit. We like our expected basis and we love working with a high-quality, financially strong developer like Toll that has the experience to capably manage construction and a climate with significant inflationary cost pressures. That said, this deal is approximately 75% bought out, reducing our risk. On current rents and costs, this deal has approximately a 5.5% development yield. And with that, I will turn the call over to Michael. Michael Manelis : Thanks, Mark. Let me start with a huge shout out to the entire Equity Residential team for their continued dedication and hard work. They remain relentless in serving our customers and working together to deliver the strongest results in the history of our company. As expected, we had a very good second quarter. Resident turnover remains at all-time lows with strong demand driving robust pricing power and high physical occupancy at 96.7%. Pricing trend, which is the net effective price of our units inclusive of concessions, has grown almost 10% since the beginning of the year, which is well above the 6% range that it historically characterized a very good year. This pricing strength has contributed to an unprecedented new lease change with July expected to be about 16.5% and a significant loss to lease of 12.5%. July\u2019s moderation in the new lease change is less than we expected and is caused by a more challenging 2021 comparable period, not a loss in operating momentum as our sequential rents continue to grow. Our current position will contribute to continued above-average second half revenue growth and strong embedded growth for 2023. Our residents are well employed, and as Mark just mentioned, seeing their incomes rise. The unemployment rate for the college educated continues to be below 3%. And while we see the same headlines that you do about slowdowns in hiring or even layoffs, we are not seeing any impact on new leases or renewals. Our operating dashboards continue to flash green. Given the amount of hiring that the tech firms have done over the last few years, even with the moderation, they are still employing more people than they did pre-pandemic. The tenure of our residents has also improved to 2.3 years on average compared to 2.1 years last year and we are losing fewer and fewer residents to home purchase as single-family homeownership gets more and more challenging. In fact, in the second quarter, we had a 22% decrease compared to the second quarter of \u201821 in the number of residents who moved out to buy a home. We remain aware of the economic headwinds and we will position the portfolio more defensively if need be. But given the significant loss to lease, strong retention and healthy demand we are seeing, we remain optimistic. That said, as is true every year in our business, we expect rent growth to peak and then moderate seasonally in the summer, but we are happy to report that has not yet occurred. In sum, our operating metrics and forecast for the balance of the year remain beyond historical norms and Bob will provide more color on the building blocks of our revised guidance in his remarks. Let me take a minute and provide some color on market performance. In Boston, demand ramped up in both the urban and suburban submarkets driving a 90 base improvement in physical occupancy over the first quarter along with robust pricing power that came earlier in the season than usual. Rents have begun to moderate in this market. However, it is not uncommon to see modest reacceleration in August as students typically return then and are an important source of demand for our portfolio. We are definitely bullish on the second half performance, particularly in the suburban submarkets and remain cautiously optimistic on the city of Boston and Cambridge\u2019s ability to absorb some of the new units that are scheduled to be delivered later this year. The market continues to have strong employment with life sciences continuing to expand their footprint. New York continues with very healthy pricing power and demand. After significant impact from the pandemic, New York same-store revenue and NOI are now fully recovered back to 2019 levels. Physical occupancy is 97%. New lease change and renewal rate achieved were robust in the second quarter, with a vibrant environment continuing to attract our affluent renter demographic who is well employed and can afford to pay our rents. Despite these rental increases, our new residents are still paying us only approximately 18% of their income and our data indicates that our rents in this market have grown more slowly over the last 3 years of our new renters. The Washington, D.C. market continues to perform well, with physical occupancy at 96.7% and good growth in both new lease and renewals in the quarter. The absorption of new supply was good in the first half of the year, but we are keeping an eye on it as the year progresses. There are more than 12,500 units being delivered in 2022 with over 7,000 of them coming in the back half of the year from a competitive leasing standpoint. The absorption rate slowed a little bit in the second quarter, but still remains very strong and at current level, should support continued pricing power. While this market has historically shown high levels of supply, it is also one of the most resilient in the country during periods of uncertainty. The D.C. area unemployment rate has returned to pre-pandemic levels and sits below the national average with good growth in the professional services and education health categories, where many of our residents are employed. Heading West, Denver has solid demand and good pricing power, stronger occupancy in the suburban portfolio and we expect some pressure from new supply in the downtown submarket. The Denver job market continues to enjoy healthy growth across a number of sectors, including the professional and business services. In Seattle, continued improvement on the quality-of-life issues is helping drive the comeback in the city, which now has rents that are just over pre-pandemic levels. Physical occupancy is above 96% and we continue to see strength in new lease rates and renewals. Concession use is isolated to the city and continues to moderate with approximately 20% of our applications receiving just under a month. This is down from over 50% from the first quarter and occupancy in the downtown submarket is now just over 96% as compared to 93% in March. Supply impact for us in 2022 is limited to our high-rise communities in the city, while 2023 shows less direct competition from new supply overall. This market continues to demonstrate high wage job creation. And while job postings from the major employers did moderate this quarter, the number of available positions is still near all-time record highs. The San Francisco market continues to improve with high occupancy supporting growth in both new lease and renewal rents. The issues around quality of life are improving, but Downtown San Francisco is still taking more time to return to pre-pandemic conditions than other markets across the country. Remember that the city was one of the last areas to ease COVID rules and just recently stepped up its focus on crime issues. While rents continue to be below pre-pandemic levels in the downtown submarket, they are working their way back. All of our other submarkets in San Francisco are at or above pre-pandemic pricing levels. Overall, I would say we are very optimistic on current trends in San Francisco, but have an eye on new supply that is expected to be delivered in the back half of the year and could erode pricing power if demand slows. Finally, Southern California continues to perform well, with physical occupancy at nearly 97% driving strong rental growth in both new lease and renewal rates. Specific to Los Angeles, the market is seeing elevated new supply as compared to the past several years, but the overall market remains undersupplied. Even in submarkets like Koreatown, where we expected pressure this year, the new supply is being quickly absorbed, leaving us better pricing power than we anticipated. On the delinquency front, we saw modest improvement in the second quarter in the payment behavior of our residents and continued rental relief receipts. As we look into the second half of the year, we don\u2019t expect rental relief receipts to be as material, which will lead to revenue growth moderation despite strong continued fundamentals. Before I turn it over to Bob, I just want to give a quick update on some of our innovation initiatives. Innovation is a major contributor to our ability to create operating efficiencies, while continuing to maintain a high level of customer service. Despite meaningful progress, we continue to have a lot of opportunity ahead of us as we integrate our initiatives, continue to leverage technology and advance our overall skill set. Just over half of our properties now operate without fully dedicated staff. We continued to invest in and implement software and processes that further enable the autonomous leasing experience, allowing customers to tour a community and interact with a member of our team or our AI leasing agent as much or as little as they desire. Self-guided tours continue to dominate as a preferred tour option, with just about 90% of all tours in the second quarter being self-guided. We are extremely excited about the future as we innovate to maximize revenue and minimize expense growth, while continuing to provide a great experience for our residents and employees. I will now turn the call over to Bob. Bob Garechana : Thanks, Michael. A quick comment on the quarter before moving to guidance on the balance sheet. Q2 normalized FFO was $0.03 above the high-end of our quarterly guidance range. This beat was almost entirely driven by better same-store NOI through a combination of better revenue growth, including lower bad debt expense and modest overall expense growth. Now, for our revisions to full year guidance, as you saw in the release last night, we significantly revised same-store revenue and normalized FFO upwards while maintaining our existing same-store expense growth guidance. Starting with same-store revenue, strong first half performance, coupled with the constructive ongoing operating environment has led us to raise our same-store revenue projections above the top end of the prior range. We now expect our same-store revenue to grow between 10% and 11%. Our new 10.5% midpoint sits at 150 basis points higher than the prior midpoint driven by continued stable physical occupancy of 96.5%, record resident retention and earlier as well as stronger pricing power, both the new lease change and renewal rate achieved across all of our markets, but particularly in New York, where recovery from the pandemic has been a positive to the upside. Our revised full year same-store revenue guidance implies a slight deceleration in same-store revenue growth in the back half of 2022. This is the result of the significant governmental rental relief payments we received in Q3 and Q4 of 2021 and the almost complete absence of relief payments we expect to receive from the rest of this year, not any expectation of a slowdown in the core business. We expect third and fourth quarter same-store quarter-over-quarter revenues without the impact of rental relief payments to be more in line with the reported Q2 number. On the expense side, we left our already strong guidance unchanged with June year-to-date expense growth of 2.8% and a number of innovation initiatives underway, we feel confident in our ability to deliver second low expense growth for the full year. As you can see in our reported results, both real estate tax growth and payroll are aiding in our ability to accomplish this goal with some offset in utilities and repairs and maintenance. We remain laser-focused on reducing or eliminating exposure to inflationary labor pressures, whether we feel the impact from our own employees through the payroll line item or from contractors through the repairs and maintenance line. We strive to reduce any pressure from higher efficiency and better decision-making along with utilization of technology that can eliminate or permanently reduce labor hours needed. In a category like utilities, we do our best to maximize our resident reimbursement income, reduce usage through both education and technology initiatives and hedge our commodity exposure. Thus far, our approach has significantly buffered growth, but we acknowledge this is a long game if the current inflationary environment continues. Putting it altogether, the revenue and expense adjustments that I just outlined resulted in a 225 basis point increase for same-store NOI at the midpoint. For normalized FFO at the midpoint our guidance changes added nearly 3% or $30 million to normalized FFO growth, which results in an approximately 18% increase year-over-year for the company. A final note on the balance sheet before Q&A. Equity Residential continues to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the REIT sector, characterized by low floating rate exposure and a long weighted average maturity. Subsequent to quarter end, we sent a notice to redeem the $500 million secured unsecured notes that are due in 2023 with proceeds from the dispositions of the two New York properties. This use of proceeds will mostly offset the normalized FFO impact of net dispositions for the year while also significantly reducing our refinancing needs in 2023. There is no prepayment penalty associated with the payoff, but there will be a modest write-off of historical discounts and costs, which is estimated on the guidance page. This write-off will be included in EPS and FFO, but not in normalized FFO. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first caller from Nick Joseph with Citi. Nick Joseph : Thanks. Mark, you touched on the transaction market a bit in the pause that you have seen there. If you were to estimate, how much do you think asset values have moved and maybe cap rates as well, obviously, NOIs are up? And then are you seeing any difference between markets maybe between expansion markets and some of your established markets? Alex Brackenridge : Hey, Nick, this is Alex. Well, as you know, the market is certainly unsettled right now and there is a lot of a feeling out process going on. So, there have been some transactions that closed. Some of those though were hard prior to the rate hikes, some of those maybe a buyer had 1031 needs. So, it\u2019s a little hard to get great clarity on that question. But clearly there is these countervailing forces that you mentioned interest rates up, economic uncertainty offset by just these tremendous property operations. So, I would say somewhere 5% to 8%, maybe up to 10%, where we are certainly seeing buyers scrutinizing things that might have a little bit of hair on them, maybe a lesser location, maybe a physical challenge that they might have overlooked before. So the range could get higher, but we also don\u2019t see a lot of distressed sellers, which lot of people are happy to keep enjoying the great performance that their properties are generating. So, it\u2019s a bit of a range, but we will see how it plays out, particularly come fall. It\u2019s a little slow in the summer as it typically has been. Mark Parrell : And just to supplement that for just a second is just talking a little bit about replacement cost. I mean, that\u2019s a big differentiator. It\u2019s a mark between the coastal markets where the premium to replacement cost and a lot of assets were sold at was not significant or even in places like New York, there was little bit of a discount. And in some of the Sunbelt markets where there was a pretty significant premium to replacement cost and you saw us really slow down our activities when we \u2013 acquisition activities, when we saw some of those premiums go up into the 20%, 25% and up range over current construction costs. So, I guess one of the things, Alex and I am going to be looking at as we think about starting to buy machine up again is those markets \u2013 those Sunbelt markets start to make more sense on a replacement cost basis. That maybe because construction costs keep going up, that maybe because values come down a little bit but that is another input that\u2019s important. And it was one of the things that made us go a lot slower towards the end of last year and the beginning of this year, Nick. Nick Joseph : Thanks. That\u2019s very helpful. And then maybe just on operations, you talked about July rents accelerating in the more challenging year-over-year comps and kind of the normal seasonality that we have seen historically, but maybe not yet. How is guidance thinking about kind of pricing in or kind of contemplating seasonality in the back half of this year? Michael Manelis : Yes, hey, Nick, this is Michael. So I think right now, where we sit and I said this in the prepared remarks that the moderation that we saw in some of the stats in July is actually kind of much less than we expected and that\u2019s really just given kind of the speed of that concession burn-off and rate growth from last year. And when we started looking at the modeling for the back half of this year, we are kind of just assuming normal kind of seasonal trends. And we have data going all the way back to 2008 to benchmark this rent seasonality that includes like the exact week when rents peaked each week, each year. And when we went back and looked and I said this in the prepared remarks, our rents have not peaked yet. And you see it over the time where you have had years where rents peaked in early July, all the way until like the very first week of September, but the most common kind of peak week has been somewhere in that first or second week of August. So as we were modeling kind of we just assume we are going to have rents peak somewhere in this first or second week of August and then have a normal kind of trail off in rents until you get to that January period. Nick Joseph : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And next, we will move on to Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. Chandni Luthra : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Mark, could you talk about some early reads, give us a lens into 2023, how should we think about the earn-in given just really strong back half that you are seeing right now, especially if we go into a tougher economic scenario like how should we think about the business and the cadence in 2023, because we obviously have a very good starting point and a foundation, but what if things get really bad from a macroeconomic standpoint? Michael Manelis : Yes. This is Michael. Maybe I\u2019ll start, and Mark, you can kind of add on, if you\u2019d like. But I think what you should expect is somewhere on our October earnings call, we will probably provide a little bit more of a range of the building blocks into 2023, that would include the earn-in. And by earn-in, for me, I use the term embedded and what that would mean is on 12/31 of this year, you would freeze the rent roll and assume that nobody moved in, nobody moves out and what does that revenue growth look like? I would tell you that in normal years, we would start January one-off with an embedded growth somewhere around 1% in the rent roll. And even with the forecasted moderation, it is pretty clear that our expected embedded growth is going to be well above kind of that average amount. So I guess I would point to the longer we go without having rents peak, right? It\u2019s just adding more growth to this embedded as every new lease and renewal gets written here in August, September and even October. And as you think about turning the corner, just factor in moderation and then your views for what intra-period growth could look like in 2023, and that\u2019s how we will be kind of doing the building blocks for our guidance for next year. But we\u2019re not at a point yet where we\u2019re willing to share those numbers because we still have a lot of transactions to write. Mark Parrell : And you asked \u2013 it\u2019s Mark, this time, Chandni. You asked a very good question of let\u2019s say the economy does fall down a bit more and we do have a more \u2013 we actually have a set recession and how do we feel? Well, certainly, that would affect our numbers negatively. I mean job growth and economic growth are vital to the apartment industry\u2019s success over the long haul. But the supply demand environment for us is very favorable right now. And so the fact that single family is pretty pricey, the fact that, that means to us that our older millennial demographics going to stay with us longer, and you see that in our retention numbers. This Gen-Z group that\u2019s pretty large that\u2019s coming through the system where there just aren\u2019t enough jobs even right now. So if there is a few fewer because a lot of what we\u2019ve seen about the job market isn\u2019t that there is so many fewer jobs and people are unemployed. It\u2019s more that the excess is being taken out of the system. So I guess our sense is the supply demand balance is pretty good for us, and it will likely be pretty good unless a recession \u2013 if a recession occurs, is very severe. So the setup for \u201823, it just really is quite excellent, even if there is a recession. It just won\u2019t be as excellent, but on a relative basis, it will still feel, I think the revenue growth for us and for most of the industry really, really good. Chandni Luthra : Very helpful. And if I could just get a quick follow-up. So obviously, the acquisition environment has taken a huge back seat here across the board. As we think about your expansion plans in the newer markets, how long do you think that gets pushed? And what are the levers? Can development at some point become a bigger tool in your arsenal as you think about getting scale in those newer markets? Mark Parrell : Yes, it\u2019s Mark again. Development is one of the tools in the toolkit. I mean one of the things that\u2019s happening now that makes us happy not to have too large a development pipeline is if values do go down a bit here, Chandni, and there is portfolios for sale, and there is a discount available to us, you\u2019ll see us be very active and very aggressive in going out and grabbing those deals. So I think you\u2019re going to see it be pretty quiet for a few months here. My guess is that buyers and sellers will decide that this is the new market. And towards the end of the year, we might get considerably more active. We will continue to do development. We like a lot of the deals. We\u2019ve got a couple more we\u2019re likely to start this year. But I guess what I\u2019m most excited about is to see some of these acquisitions come in at a little bit more reasonable price, to be able for us to act on that and act in volume on that. So again, to us, it seems like it\u2019s going to be quiet kind of through Labor Day for sure, and then it might pick up a bit. Alex, what would you \u2013 I don\u2019t have a deadline for completing the transformation of the portfolio. I mean we will be reactive to the market opportunity. Do you have any... Alex Brackenridge : I would just add that in environments like this, we have a competitive advantage over some higher leverage buyers. So it\u2019s been very competitive. Everyone\u2019s bid was more or less the same in the last couple of years, now the ability to transact very quickly. We have our own management company, our due diligence is very fast, and we\u2019re all cash. So \u2013 and we have great relationships. And that\u2019s the thing we\u2019re doing right now is maintaining our relationships with our brokers and with principles. And when the time is right, we will move quickly and the machine will get ramped up again. Chandni Luthra : Great, thanks and congrats on a strong quarter. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Now we will move on to Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Yes, thanks. Good morning. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about where renewal increases went out for August, September, I assume October is maybe a little too far out. But maybe talk about that? And then could you also talk about maybe, Bob, what\u2019s in guidance for the back half of the year in terms kind of blended spreads either by quarter or maybe for the second half in general? Michael Manelis : Yes. So Steve, this is Michael. I\u2019ll just start and talk a little bit about the renewals. So yes, we definitely have kind of renewal quotes put out into the marketplace through the end of September and even into October. I said in the prepared remarks, we have a lot of confidence in this renewal process that we put in place. So right now, the quotes that have gone out in July and August, on a net effective basis, we\u2019re right around 12%. And we\u2019re negotiating somewhere right under that 200 basis point kind of spread. So we expect to achieve around 10%. I think that\u2019s a fairly good number to think about for the next several months. And even as you think about the balance of the year, you will see some moderation in that achieved renewal increase rate, but it\u2019s not going to be this material drop off. It\u2019s going to stay somewhere in that high single digit and maybe even to this low kind of double-digit range. But I think as we think about our process right now, we\u2019ve centralized all of the renewal negotiations, which has really kind of helped facilitating these renewal conversations and giving us a lot of confidence as we put out these quotes to really be able to project kind of what to expect from them. Mark Parrell : And Steve, before Bob just gives you a little more elaboration on blended spreads and such, One of the things that\u2019s, I think, really interesting here on renewals is because in a fair number of jurisdictions, mostly in California, we can\u2019t raise rents to market that we\u2019re limited up to some jurisdictional limits, you\u2019re going to have some energy even if rents do decline a bit as they will seasonally and as they may due to the economy, I think renewals will be another positive in \u201823 because we\u2019re going to have markets where we continue to be significantly. In some cases, even 20% below the market even after an increase. And so if that 20% becomes 15%, it\u2019s still a pretty good size increase. So I think the fact that we haven\u2019t been able to meet the market on renewals probably leaves a little bit of gas in the tank in \u201823 too even if rents do moderate for both \u2013 and they will for seasonal reasons, but for economic reasons, I\u2019m sorry, Bob. Bob Garechana : Yes. So I think Mark and Michael kind of gave you the blended perspective, which is in our guidance, so maintaining that kind of high single-digit renewal component. So they gave you the renewal piece, and I\u2019ll give you the blended, which really is the new lease. So we talked about the seasonality and the trend of seasonality in rents, coupled with that just hard comparable period in the back half of 2021 and that\u2019s going to lead your new lease and as a result, correspondingly, you\u2019re blended to moderate as you get into the back half of the year, which is what we\u2019re including in our guidance. That\u2019s very normal. I think the only abnormal thing here is what we\u2019ve modeled is something that remains positive on the new lease side. In a normal year, kind of pre-pandemic, new lease change often would go negative in the fourth quarter, and that\u2019s not what we\u2019re incorporating in our guidance. Steve Sakwa : Great. And then maybe just a second question, sort of following up on the transactions and sort of change in cap rates, either Mark or Alex, where do you guys think kind of unlevered IRRs are today or where do you sort of targeting? And what do you think the market is targeting, realizing that cap rates can kind of be all over the board, but where do you think the current hurdles are? Alex Brackenridge : Yes. As I said, it\u2019s a little bit tough to know because it\u2019s pretty unsure footing right now. That is an answer we\u2019re looking for. On our end, we look a lot about what we can sell properties for. So we have some transactions in the market that we\u2019re considering, and we will see how pricing comes out on that, and that dictates it a lot. But clearly, it\u2019s higher than it was. I don\u2019t know if I have an exact number on that. Steve Sakwa : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And next, we will move on to John Pawlowski with Green Street. John Pawlowski : Thanks. Alex, a follow-up question on the lack of price discovery, could you just help quantify the magnitude of the bid-ask spread right now kind of the ranges you\u2019re seeing? Are sellers\u2019 expectations 5% above buyers or 20% above buyers right now? Alex Brackenridge : Yes. John, it\u2019s Alex. As I said, it varies a lot and well-located, clean properties. I think it\u2019s closer to the 5-ish on something that\u2019s more complicated maybe as a physical issue, maybe got a lot of vacant retail. It\u2019s going to be higher than that. But that\u2019s the number people are feeling each other out and they really don\u2019t know. And I think it\u2019s a time just to be patient, which is what we\u2019re doing and most sellers \u2013 most sellers and buyers are doing that right now. So there is some assets that have just been pulled off a market because there is not a lot of traction, but there is a whole bunch of money on the sidelines, as you know, and there is a lot of people that are, frankly, right now hiring up because they expect to buy more apartments in the future. So I think that this will settle itself out but there is a range right now to answer your question of pricing variance between the buyer and seller expectations. John Pawlowski : Okay, thanks. Bob, one question for you on expenses, can you just give us a little bit of color on the real estate tax backdrop right now, basically 0% growth year-to-date. Is there any unusual appeals benefiting the expense line item in real estate taxes? And any color on what type of step changes we could expect going forward would be helpful? Bob Garechana : Yes. To be honest with you, it\u2019s less about appeals in 2022 than it probably has been historically and more about just lower assessed values we came into the year, particularly in a place like Washington state, where we had lower assessed values and where rate wasn\u2019t particularly high either on the real estate tax side. So that\u2019s really been the driver of keeping it more modest. The real estate tax market is typically a laggard. So it usually delayed relative to like market values in other places. So that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing play out in 2022. As we look forward into 2023 and not giving guidance, we\u2019re just setting the tone for the environment, I think it will become more about appeals because I think the recovery and what\u2019s happening in the broader kind of valuation and market is more apparent. And so I think it will be more what I call hand-to-hand combat with the assessors of you think that value is X, I think value is Y and let\u2019s appeal. So I think that\u2019s going to change the dynamic in 2023 and going forward. John Pawlowski : Alright. Thanks for the time. Operator : Thank you. Next, we will move on to Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Joshua Dennerlein : Yes. Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I just kind of wanted to hear your thoughts on the supply outlook for 2023 any kind of markets where you\u2019re seeing more supply or less supply? Alex Brackenridge : Yes, there is a range. I mean, certainly, New York is the poster child for lower supply. But there are other markets, too, like Orange County and San Diego that are seeing a drop off in supply. Markets that have continued high supply include Washington, D.C., Denver has a lot of supply, Austin and Dallas and more moderate are Atlanta, Seattle and Boston. So it varies a lot across the market. And overall, it\u2019s pretty steady. Looking at 2024 though, it gets \u2013 \u201824, \u201825, it gets more complicated and harder to project. And we see a lot of permits that have been pulled. But we\u2019ve looked historically, and when times get a little uncertain like this. There is a big drop off. I mean, historically, permits translate into starts like 80% to 80%, 80%, 90%. But when times get tough, that drops to 40% to 50%. So that\u2019s what might happen over time here as the \u201824, \u201825 deliveries decrease. Joshua Dennerlein : One follow-up on that with New York City, the 421a program expired. Just kind of curious if you\u2019re hearing anything maybe if there is any kind of replacement program that might come to influence the supply outlook on a longer term basis or just how you might think about some of the projects that might have [Technical Difficulty] program and yes? Alex Brackenridge : Yes. No, it doesn\u2019t feel super optimistic. There was a proposal that got rejected. So at this point, there is some discussions, but nothing imminent. Joshua Dennerlein : Okay, I will leave it there. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And next, we will move on to Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Brad Heffern : Hi, everybody. I was curious if you could talk about the use of the disposition proceeds to take out debt versus something else like a repurchase or an alternate use of capital? Mark Parrell : Hey, Brad, it\u2019s Mark. So we certainly have the capability to buy the stock back, and we get that. As we\u2019ve talked about on these calls in the past, it\u2019s a bit of a different thing for REITs than it is for most corporates because we don\u2019t retain earnings. So to do a real buyback, again, it requires you to sell a bunch of assets, which we did do or incur a bunch of debt. And from our perspective, paying off the debt helped us address the \u201823 maturities. It gave us optionality to buy the stock back later. We used up really all of our capability. So we have a little bit of a flex each year in our ability to sell assets and retain cash. And we really used all of that up with these two sales. So we thought, you know what, we will pay down this debt, we will retain this capability. If the Board decides it wants to buy some stock back later, we will have that opportunity. But those opportunities are just so few and for REITs, you start to descale the enterprise. It\u2019s just not as easy a decision as it is for, say, a big technology company with tons of retained earnings. And we got a big $900 million-plus dividend. And that\u2019s really where we think the cash return to the shareholder is. A lot of these other folks that talk about buybacks more readily are corporates that don\u2019t have dividends and do a lot more buyback activity as a matter, of course. So we did consider it, it\u2019s an option by paying some debt off, we retain that option. Brad Heffern : Okay. Got it. And then I was wondering if you could talk about what\u2019s happening with sort of the deal seeker tenants in New York, the new lease change was 38% in the second quarter. I know across the portfolio, turnovers remain low, but are you seeing those people leave? Michael Manelis : Yes. So I would say, look, our record low turnover, we had 11.1% reported tax turnover in the second quarter, which is the lowest turnover we\u2019ve reported for a second quarter in the history. You are starting to see and we even said this, acknowledge this a little bit in June through some of the conversations we had. You are starting to see a little bit of price resistance from some folks that came in with the deal early on in this recovery, they were renewing at the exact same pace. And by deal seekers, I mean people that came in that received concessions, really discounted rent. What we saw right now when we looked at the move-out behaviors in the second quarter, we saw a slight uptick in people citing that the increase was too expensive, and that was the reason they were moving out. And I think specific into New York, we definitely saw some folks from Manhattan kind of give us that notice and then move over into kind of that Jersey City area and taking advantage of some of the rent arbitrage there, just at that lower price point. But overall, I would say the renewal percent, the percent of residents renewing remains really strong. We\u2019re either at or right above like these historical averages for this time of the year. And we really just haven\u2019t seen us bumping up against this kind of affordability question that\u2019s been out there. And the rent as a percent of income in our portfolio remains very constant which means that the income for our residents is definitely keeping pace kind of with the rent increases that we\u2019re seeing across the markets. Brad Heffern : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And next, we will move on to Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Adam Kramer : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate the time. I just want to maybe ask a bigger picture question a little bit. Look, I think when we kind of think about historical rent growth, right, it was kind of in a different \u2013 or potentially different inflationary regime. And look, I think we\u2019re certainly not expecting inflation to kind of continue with these year-over-year levels. But even if we kind of do settle out a kind of higher year-over-year inflation increases than maybe what we\u2019ve seen historically, maybe kind of walk us through how you would view rent growth in that type of environment relative kind of historical rent growth? Mark Parrell : Yes. Hey, it\u2019s Mark. I\u2019m going to start, and I think some of us might \u2013 some of the others might supplement because we\u2019ve been thinking a lot about this over time. So we went back and looked at periods of time when there was more significant inflation. So again, this will be more like the \u201880s and parts of the \u201870s and even into the \u201890s. And I guess I\u2019d say our ability to reset rents every year, the pretty good supply-demand dynamic, in fact, very good we have currently. I don\u2019t have a number for you. I would have normally said that normal trend growth for EQR on the revenue line is 3.5%. And I would tell you that with inflation the way it is, the numbers are likely to be a fair bit higher because supply and demand are still also good. We could have a ton of inflation. If you have a ton of supply in a submarket, you\u2019re still not moving your rents. But we\u2019ve got good demand, single-family sectors, not drawing residents away. So the way we\u2019re feeling about it is that we\u2019re going to be able to provide a pretty good margin to whatever the inflation numbers are especially as we expect them to sort of settle down. There is also this little bit of a circular reference thing where rent is something like third of the CPI. So we feed into that number, and that number feeds into our number. And so there is a little bit of that as well. But I think you should expect that apartments, especially our portfolio, are optimized in a way with our pricing engine that we can continue to have a real return that exceeds the rate of inflation. So if you think inflation is 5, then I think our growth is going to be a margin to that number, above it. I think the other part of that question or that answer, though, is what are you doing with your expenses, because we do feel the pressure on wages and other things. And that\u2019s why we had both Michael and Bob address that issue with you because we need to keep our margins constant or growing and not just give it all the way on the expense side, and I think we\u2019re doing an exceptionally good job of that. Adam Kramer : That was really, really helpful. I appreciate all the color. I think just a quick follow-up, if I may. I think physical occupancy that says held in here with the market well and 96.5% in July is a pretty notable number. Just wondering how you guys kind of think about the renewal versus kind of occupancy kind of trade-off? Renewals have decelerated a little bit. It sounds like they can maybe kind of stay at this 10% growth here, but a little bit of a deceleration versus what they were in 1Q and 2Q. Just maybe walk us through kind of the trade-off between occupancy and pushing renewals a little bit more, maybe? Michael Manelis : Yes. So well, I think we\u2019re always pushing the renewal front because we\u2019re quoting kind of where street rents are and then we\u2019re having these dialogues and pretty much holding the line. When somebody does move out, so if you don\u2019t renew that resident, you are absorbing vacancy loss. So that definitely starts to come into some of that equation. If you just step back and think about the occupancy of this portfolio, I mean, when demand is strong and the front door is strong, you have a lot more confidence to hold the line into kind of this renewal process because if that resident does move out, you\u2019re able to fill them very quickly at these high rates. So for us, if the demand picture stays as strong as it is, I would expect our portfolio is going to maintain strong occupancy. I think we should allow occupancy to probably trail off a little bit into that fourth quarter, but I think it is going to remain relatively strong. So when we look at the difference between new lease and renewal, I mean, we want to retain our residents, we want to retain our residents at a fair price. If the front door is not as strong, you will see us start to negotiate more into that renewal process. But if the demand stays as strong as it is, you\u2019re going to see us kind of hold the line with these renewals. Adam Kramer : Thanks for the time. Operator : Thank you. Next, we will move on to Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : Thanks. I just wanted to touch on bad debt for a minute. I think you said that was part of the beat versus your guidance on the quarter. And I know you break that out and the supplemental I think was about 2.5% net benefit to same-store growth on a GAAP basis this quarter. How should we think about the back half of the year and that level of \u2013 is it still a benefit year-over-year just from a modeling standpoint, how we should think about that? Bob Garechana : Yes. So I\u2019ll start with the last part first and then highlight a couple of things about the quarter. So from a year-over-year standpoint, our guidance assumption is that it has no impact to growth meaning that we think that bad debt, net of governmental rental receipts and all of the above is the same in \u201822 as what it is in \u201821. What you\u2019re seeing in the second quarter is really the volatility in timing because you will recall from the first quarter that we had a little bit of a harder time with bad debt and then we had a better time in the second quarter, etcetera. So this number can be fairly volatile. As you get into the back half of the year, and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the rental relief programs are winding down. So we don\u2019t expect a lot more rental relief money in the back half of the year. We got a lot of it in the back half of last year. So it\u2019s going to be a little bit of a headwind to year-over-year growth in the back half. But from a full year standpoint, again, shouldn\u2019t have any impact. Mark Parrell : Yes. Just \u2013 and Bob will correct my specific numbers here, but I think we got in the back half of last year, $34 million or so in the same-store set in rental relief. And our modeling is something like $2 million for the back half of this year. So when we talked in our prepared remarks about how we see the strength continuing, what obscures some of these numbers is just these pretty significant rent recoveries from the government that tend to be kind of lumpy. So to see in the back half of the year, a negative impact year-over-year on all this bad debt stuff but you\u2019re going to see the continued strength, we think, in the underlying occupancy business. rate, all of that stuff, occupancy is staying high, that\u2019s going to offset that and keep those numbers pretty consistent, Nick, going forward. Nick Yulico : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Just one other one is on renewals and just how to think conceptually about how you guys are thinking about that ability heading into next year? I mean you talked about right, high occupancy, not that much supply impact. It\u2019s been low turnover in the business. So as you\u2019re thinking about the numbers right around 10% right now on renewals, I mean, what pushes that number down at all, I guess, over the next year. When do you start thinking, hey, we\u2019re pushing for too much of a renewal notice here? Michael Manelis : Yes. Well, this is Michael. I think it\u2019s really a function of where our market rents. So what happens to intra-period rent growth next year is really going to dictate a lot around where these quotes go out. But I think Mark mentioned earlier on the call, when you think about some of these regulations that we\u2019ve been bumping up against this year, those regulations are actually going to help fuel renewal growth next year because it\u2019s clear we\u2019re going to be able to be quoting increases beyond what intra-period rent growth is just to catch up to the market through that. So in our modeling, yes, you\u2019re going to have a little bit of this tail off in this achieved renewal increase because you have to assume that market rent prices seasonally do decline. They have declined every single year since 2008. At some point, you hit a peak and then you have some sense of moderation through 12/31 of the year, and then you start the cycle all over again. So that moderation is going to yield some softness in the quotes that go out the door. But again, it\u2019s very marginal. It\u2019s still going to be very high single digit of this low kind of double-digit. And then as we get into this October call, we will kind of give you our view as to how we think this is going to play out into 2023. But again, we got a little bit of a boost coming to us from just being able to catch up from all the regulation restrictions that we\u2019re faced with today. Nick Yulico : Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And next, we will move on to Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Michael Goldsmith : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. As we look at the rent growth over the last several quarters and also looking forward, there is kind of three factors at play, which we\u2019ve talked about, which is kind of the overall rental market, tougher comparisons and the presence or lack of government subsidies. So we\u2019ve touched a little bit about the government subsidies through the back half of the year. But I guess, as we think about just going forward and the ability for rents to continue to grow on this tougher comparisons like the government subsidies, like what\u2019s the thought process on the continuation of this and how much of the deceleration can kind of be expected just based on these tougher comparisons as you move past, as you lap some of the stronger growth? Michael Manelis : Yes. I mean this is Michael. I think you are hitting on a couple of points. So, even when you look at the data and you see some of that rate growth deceleration that occurred like on the renewal quote. A lot of this is just a function of that comp period from last year. And just to remind everybody, last year, when we hit July, that was the first time that our new lease change went positive. June of \u201821, we were negative 50 basis points, July of \u201821, new lease change went to positive 6.9%. So, a huge 740 basis point improvement in one month in just that new lease change. And then from that point forward, it\u2019s sequentially approved every single month that new lease change and then fuel blended. So, as we think about where we sit today, you have to, like I said before, we have to allow for rents to moderate. The price in the market will moderate between now and the end of the year. In a normal year, I would say it\u2019s somewhere in that 3% to 3.5% range is where kind of the market rents after you peak whichever week you peak at, you will allow some moderation to the end of the year in the tune of about 3.5%. But then when you look at where we are at with the changes that we were seeing last year sequentially, that is what\u2019s going to fuel this moderation in our blended rate that we will be putting up in the third quarter and fourth quarter. But all that being said, where we land after the moderation, where we land after these tough comps is still significantly above historical norms. Michael Goldsmith : Got it. And my second question is on the kind of the expectation of expenses. You are coming off of \u2013 you have some of the lowest expense in the market. Your \u2013 the expense comparisons get a little bit tougher in the back half, and you have been able to manage it quite well. Just as we think about the sustainability of controlling the expense line in the intermediate term, especially kind of in an inflationary environment. Do you have any thoughts on how you can kind of sustain the strong performance over the intermediate term? Thanks. Bob Garechana : Yes. I think the core driver that will be consistent throughout is kind of what I mentioned in my prepared remarks, which is just reducing our exposure to labor pressure, whether it\u2019s in the payroll line item where it\u2019s the most obvious, right, which you see us having put up were literally probably on the 4 years in a row of either sub-1% or negative kind of payroll growth, we still have opportunity there, right. And so I think that\u2019s the engine of innovation and utilization and technology, and we will be able to completely or continue to sustain that kind of lower than inflationary growth going forward. That should also parlay itself into repairs and maintenance to a degree, too, because you get that benefit because there is a labor component embedded there with contractors, etcetera. So, I think that\u2019s the driver of where I think we have the most containment opportunity. Clearly, as you move into future years, real estate taxes will get harder from a comp standpoint and probably won\u2019t be as sustainable. But comps like utilities should get better, we hope hopefully that the commodity inflationary pressure that exists in the world today is more temporary than permanent. And so that should help us and hopefully offset other line items that might return to more normal growth. But again, the controllable part is really the labor hours, the payroll, the technology, the innovation, and that\u2019s where we are focused. Michael Goldsmith : And just a quick follow-up on that. How much more runway is there? Is this like another year or 2 years, or is this kind of a multiyear pathway where you should continue to benefit from that? Michael Manelis : Yes. Well, this is Michael. I think from the operating efficiencies when we think about payroll benefits, I would say we are probably getting closer to the middle innings of our runway. And I said before, like when we talked about kind of we think we have identified $25 million to $30 million that\u2019s going to roll in over the course of 2023 and 2024 front half-loaded with kind of more of the expense opportunities and then it kicks into the initiatives focused on enhancing revenue. So, I look at the expense stuff and I would say we are probably in the middle of the innings there, but we are in the very early stages of the benefits from the revenue lifts on many of the initiatives that we are focused on. Michael Goldsmith : Thank you very much. Good luck in the back half. Operator : Thank you. And next, we will move on to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Thank you. Hey, Mark. On your commentary on the market dynamics in the Sunbelt, with pricing above replacing cost, this dynamic continues and it seems like both public and private peers are very active in the market. How will that impact your repositioning strategy? Will you focus more on development, or do you perhaps look at suburban markets or other markets in Sunbelt? Alex Brackenridge : Hey John, it\u2019s Alex. In terms of pricing moderating, so that\u2019s making acquisitions look relatively more attractive. If that continues, construction costs go up, then we would lean more towards acquisitions, but we are also focused on development, too, as an important component of fleshing out the portfolio. So, I would expect we would do a little bit of both depending on the circumstances. Mark Parrell : And just to add, we are buying in suburbs of places like Dallas too. It isn\u2019t mostly or even close to mostly in all urban portfolio. We are trying to construct in Atlanta or Austin or Dallas or Denver. So, we are spreading our capital out. And that\u2019s where development can be really handy is in some of these suburban locations where it might be hard to find a property to buy. John Kim : Okay. And then Michael mentioned in the Q&A about effective lease growth trending around 10%, give or take. I wonder 200 basis points in the next few months and maybe softening towards the end of the year. But my question is, is this already embedded in your same-store guidance, or have you accomplished this as upward bias to your same-store revenue? Michael Manelis : Yes. So, this is Michael. Let me clarify. So, the numbers that I was quoting before is the achieved renewal rate off of the offers that we put out there, where we believe that is going to be around this 10% for the next several months. And when we think about kind of the midpoint of our guidance, Bob pointed to this earlier, we are allowing some moderation in the new lease change and we are factoring in fairly consistent achieved renewal rate increases based on what we can see with a little bit of moderation in the fourth quarter just based on kind of normal seasonal decline in rate. John Kim : Great. Thank you. Operator : And next, we will move on to Rich Anderson with SMBC. Rich Anderson : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I want to get back to what you said earlier about normal earning for the following year is 1%. And so you are thinking it will be something more than that. I guess that\u2019s helpful. But maybe if we can dig into that a little bit more. So, how linear is the relationship between blended rate and their earning. In other words, like for the 1% typical for the earning that you described, what does that assume or what does that imply in terms of the blended rate in the previous year. And if we were to just do a ratio, would it be correct to assume that if it\u2019s 5x more this year than the earning will be 5x more or is it not that simple? Mark Parrell : Not that simple. Michael Manelis : It\u2019s not that simple, but I will correct you. I think I did say it\u2019s going to be well above average. Well above that\u2026 Mark Parrell : Then scratch the quarter. Michael Manelis : Maybe that\u2019s a little more helpful. Yes. Look, again, I said this earlier. We are still writing a lot of leases, right. You still got a lot of activity coming through the rent roll. I think it\u2019s clear that we have got the right setup in place for a really strong year next year based on the fundamentals of loss to lease, looking at where this embedded growth is today, looking at the strength in the market, knowing that rents haven\u2019t peaked out yet. So, I think you just got to hold off and give us until October, and we will give you a little bit more clarity into the ranges of these building blocks, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as pure as like there is a direct one-to-one relationship between blended rate and kind of where that embedded growth is on 12/31. Rich Anderson : I am aware there is many more variables, I was just trying to get to perhaps a more precise number. And then the second question I have is you talked, Mark at the early stage of single-family rental \u2013 single-family home affordability helping the apartment business. Do you have your eyes on any sort of replacement competitive pressures. If it\u2019s not buying a home or whatever the reasons are, top five reasons are the people move out. What we have this time around, which is somewhat new is single-family rental as an option for people that are \u2013 millennials that are \u2013 that have families that need more space and so on. So, do you have your eye on like kind of a change in the competitive landscape outside of conventional multifamily that is sort of on your radar screen right now is something to watch? Mark Parrell : Yes, it\u2019s Mark. Thanks for that \u2013 that\u2019s a very insightful question. We thought a fair bit about it. We wondered if it isn\u2019t similar to buying something you do as a lifestyle decision. I mean people mostly buy homes, not for financial reasons, but lifestyle. They have the second kid, they got married or had some other life change that requires them or makes them feel like, we will do the commute, we will do what we need to do to have the lifestyle we now need to have with the family situation we now have. I think that single-family rental does feels the same way that people will be similarly attracted to it, not because they have died them all along, but because they are really at a point where they have two kids and they are living in an urban environment, and that\u2019s just more challenging for them or whatnot. So, I think about SFR as more of an additional competitor for sure, but having the same drivers as just purchasing a home. In terms of other competitive threats, we have definitely benefited from people wanting more space and decoupling. We do see that people will accept roommates and live in other situations. So, just switching to another thing that could be a demand negative for us, it\u2019s possible that it will go the other direction. I mean it is certainly something rich that could happen where folks decide they will take on the roommate. They are not as afraid to the pandemic, and they will do that. We are not seeing any of that, but that would be another way you could see demand decline. But I don\u2019t \u2013 these SFR homes are mostly, it seems to us a replacement for single-family owned housing, not a new \u2013 like an entirely new source of competition. Rich Anderson : In the past, EQR got in front of some of these things. Whether it was rent-to-own programs or what have you. What do you think about single-family rental, I mean as a place where you and your peers might start to dip your toes in over time? Mark Parrell : Yes. That\u2019s a really interesting question. I mean we had a version of this conversation, if I remember a couple of quarters ago. But it\u2019s part of our job. And your question implies it to be looking at every subsector in the residential space. I think single-family rental has certainly established itself as a very legitimate long-term business. A lot of our former executives worked in that space. We do pay attention to that space. It\u2019s very interesting in that regard. Our primary focus right now is running this big apartment business we have. But we will keep our eyes open. And I guess if something wanders buy, we will act on it. But again, we are getting a lot of benefit right now and people moving into these cities again, and we are focused mostly on that at this point. Rich Anderson : Thanks so much. Mark Parrell : Thanks Rich. Operator : Thank you. And next, we will move on to Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Haendel St. Juste: Hey there. Thank you. Appreciate the time. A couple of quick questions for me. First one on the expenses. Certainly sounds like technology and operating efficiencies are helping offset their pervasive cost headwinds. A couple of questions on that. Maybe you can remind us or update us on how far along you are in the technology implementation and efficiency plan that you talked about in the last few quarters? And then secondly, I am curious if you are seeing any distinction in OpEx between your urban and suburban assets? Are you finding it more efficient perhaps to operate urban high-rise versus suburban assets given perhaps less acreage to maintain fewer HVAC? Thanks. Michael Manelis : Yes. So Haendel, this is Michael. I guess I would just start \u2013 I think I just went through a little bit of this as to where we are, which is from the efficiency standpoint on the operating platform. I would say that we are probably getting close to the middle innings, midway through. We have got a lot of the base technology installed. We are still working through some of kind of the smart home technology or access into units that we will add to some more efficiencies. You got half the portfolio running today without fully dedicated teams there. So, we have still got a little bit of opportunity kind of left to layer in the technology and create more efficiencies in the property management side. But for us, we are more excited right now because we are still in the early stages of the lift that we see from layering in technology into the income side of our business, the revenue growth engine, and we are in the very early innings of that of laying out all of these initiatives. And that benefit really comes in, in late \u201823 and into \u201824. But I think what you will see is you are going to see us continue to kind of mitigate some of the inflationary pressures on OpEx by just continuing what we have laid out in course of leveraging technology to create the operating efficiencies that will mitigate some of the expense pressures in 2023. And then you will see the engine kick in and switch more to the revenue lift. Haendel St. Juste: Any color on OpEx trends or comparisons between urban and suburban assets? Michael Manelis : Yes. I mean I guess I would look into some of the high-rise portfolios and say, you typically would have more staffing there. You have concierge, you have more labor pressure. You clearly have more dependency on some contractors relative to elevators and things like that. So, I guess I haven\u2019t looked at the number, but I would be surprised if we don\u2019t see a little bit more growth in the high-rise portfolio than we did in the suburban garden style. Mark Parrell : And Juste, its Mark. To add to that good question you have there. I mean the CapEx load, for example, and I know you referred to expenses, but the CapEx load is spread on a high-rise usually at much higher rent than the Garden one. So, you might be doing things with chillers and you might be doing things, but there is one roof, not a multitude of roofs. There is no landscaping. So, putting aside real estate taxes, margins I would think the labor only margin would not be as good in a high-rise because of usually higher service standards. But I bet just some of the CapEx with the higher rents is a lower percentage of each rent dollar in a high-rise. So, that\u2019s typically what we have seen in the high-rises as you do the work and then you don\u2019t need to do anything at all for quite a period of time. So, there is a little bit of an interplay there with expenses and capital. Haendel St. Juste: Fair enough. Thanks for that clarity. One more, I guess a follow-up on the Toll partnership and new Fort Worth project that you are starting here. Is that 5.5% yield you outlined, is that locked in, or can that be adjusted at yields or cap rates moved significantly? And then you mentioned that 75% of the costs are locked in there as well. What about the remaining 25%? Are you insulated from that, or how would that work? Alex Brackenridge : Yes. So, the 5.5% is just our projected yield. It\u2019s not locked in. We have \u2013 we are a partner with them. We have 75% of the equity. They have 25% and then the property will yield, what it yields and they will get their promotes relative to that. And then the second part of your question, what was that again? I am sorry. Haendel St. Juste: Locked in cost. Alex Brackenridge : Lockdown with the cost, yes. So, 75% is what we bought out. We have got the \u2013 Toll has bought out from their contractor. They also have a guarantee to us that they will be able to perform at that 100% number. So, it\u2019s just further surety that you have both the contractor and the developer had bought out 75%. Toll has a little bit more work to do to get it 100% bought out. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And next, we will move on to Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : Hi. I guess still morning out there. But thank you. I got two questions. Well, a very efficient call. You guys have gone through a lot of people. On the residents, last year, clearly, the city benefited big time as people flooded back in and took to renting apartments. Are you seeing that same phenomenon this year? So, meaning the ability for you guys to push rents, is that really driven by people continuing to flood into the markets, or are you seeing this year more normal that most of your demand is from within the market with some move in? I am just trying to get a sense of how the new resident profile has changed last year versus this year? Mark Parrell : Yes. Alex, it\u2019s Mark. I am going to start and Michael is going to supplement, because he does have some good statistical stuff for you. As we kind of look at these markets, Seattle and San Francisco are less well recovered compared to New York and the East Coast markets. So, we still have that tailwind of people returning. And we have talked on some of these calls that if things and we do feel some improvement in the public safety situation in those two markets in the urban core, that is a possible tailwind for EQR towards the end of this year and going into next year, because there is relative value in Downtown Seattle and Downtown San Francisco on rents because they are still not really back. They are not \u2013 certainly, they are not evolved where they were when the pandemic occurred. And a lot of these suburban rents are crowding those rent levels, as we have said on calls. So, I will let Michael talk about where the people are coming from. But I think that red check being low on a relative basis still, it makes those markets attractive if public safety concerns continue to go away. So, I am sorry, Michael. Michael Manelis : Yes. No. So, I will just remind everybody, we do receive that time of application, a previous address for our new residents coming into the portfolio. So, this is where kind of these stats come from. And I will tell you, this quarter, we looked at the trends for the second quarter move in, and we continue to see slightly more new residents coming into our portfolio from outside of an MSA or even the state than normal. And to just give you some stats, so in a normal environment, and this would be like 2018, 2019, like historical data, we would typically see about 60% of our new residents come to us from within the same MSA and about 64% come from within the same state. Our move-ins during the second quarter 55% came from within the same MSA, so about 5% lower and 59% came from within the same state. So, both of these metrics were down about 500 basis points. And when we drilled in to any one of these areas to say where are they coming from, is it concentrated? Like is everybody coming to Seattle from San Francisco or anything like that, it was not concentrated at all, it was very fragmented. And for us, we view this as a very good positive indicator that our markets are continuing to draw this and attract this affluent renter from all over the United States and even slightly more kind of from the foreign countries because we saw that number tick up a little bit, too. Alexander Goldfarb : And you would say that was pretty \u2013 those stats are pretty uniform across all your markets? I mean obviously, you spoke Seattle and San Fran, but it\u2019s pretty uniform across all or biased. Michael Manelis : Yes. I guess I would tell you when we went into like Southern Cal, like Orange County and San Diego, the inbound or the new residents there. It was more like in line and California typically has a really high percent that comes from within the same MSA in the same kind of state, very loyal to that state in MSA. That didn\u2019t have quite the same kind of shift as the whole portfolio, but it was pretty systemic across all the markets and even submarkets that we saw that trend. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second question is, on the asset sale, you only quoted the IRR for the second quarter sales. I don\u2019t know what the IRR was on the July sale, but 6.6% unlevered IRR, how does that compare to your historic, I would have thought it would have been better just because of cap rate compression. And I think you guys have owned your New York asset a long time. You certainly bought the Macklowe assets that are really attractive cap rate. I guess I would have expected a better IRR, but maybe some perspective and then also your thoughts on the July 1? Alex Brackenridge : Yes. So, Alex, this is Alex. We have a couple of things that work there. One is it\u2019s a long time. We built those property \u2013 I am sorry, we bought those properties in 2005. So, you have got an IRR spread. Typically, IRRs go down over time just because they get diluted a little bit. So, there is that at work. It\u2019s also New York went through some challenging times since 2005. There was the GFC and the recovery from that. Then there was the pandemic. And then there were the changes to the rent stabilization laws that had an impact particularly on one\u2019s ability to convert a property in the condominiums, which was buttressing for a period of time, a lot of value in apartment buildings in New York. So, all of those things kind of combined to work against us. On top of which cap rates started out low in New York. So, there was less compression there. Because I think your question kind of implies there has been all this compression, why wouldn\u2019t you see more value growth, and in New York, we just didn\u2019t see that because it started so low and stayed low. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And next, we will move on to Pedro Cardoso with TCW. Pedro Cardoso : Hi. Thanks for taking the call. Congratulation on the quarter. Just a quick one for me. I will be curious to know if you guys have been noticing any shift in tenant behavior, perhaps are they looking to shift to small units, or are they trying to find something a little bit more affordable. I will be curious to know if you re seeing any shifts in any way shape or form? I know that from a debt \u2013 from a rent income perspective, the portfolio is very healthy. But could you just know if you guys are noticing any shifts on those trends? Michael Manelis : Pedro, this is Michael. So first, just on the reasons for move-out, I said this a little bit earlier, we did see a slight uptick and just the increase was too expensive as one of the reasons that they are citing for move-outs that did occur. But again, we are running off of a base of an 11.1% turnover, which is the lowest that we have seen in the second quarter. When you just step back and just think about the overarching behaviors of the residents, I will bucket this into like a decoupling, like are we seeing any changes in unit type preference, are we seeing any changes in kind of the average adult per occupied home. And I would say, in our portfolio, we really haven\u2019t seen this material change. Pre-pandemic, we used to be at 1.65 adults per occupied home. Sitting here today, we are at 1.57. So, you can kind of see a slight decline in the average adult. And when you drill in \u2013 it\u2019s actually a little bit more prevalent in our one-bedroom household, which is about 48% or 50% kind of our portfolio versus anything that we saw like in the larger unit type. So, I think when you just step back and you think about macro trends in our industry, there is potential decoupling, whether it\u2019s explained by young adults making lifestyle decisions later, relative rent affordability that we saw during the pandemic, and now they are kind of moving on to something else or maybe starting to double up. We haven\u2019t seen that in our own or even just the rising wages, allowing single dose to live by themselves. All of that is contributing probably to this incremental demand and strength in pricing power. But specific to like our affluent renter in our portfolio, I wouldn\u2019t say that we have seen a significant shift in their behaviors. Pedro Cardoso : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And one follow-up, if I may. And again, I understand that it\u2019s a very healthy rent to income portfolio for the New York portfolio around 18%. But I will be curious to know if there are \u2013 what are the extremes like, meaning how many tenants have rent income that are above 30%, that represents over the total tenant base that you have in New York? Michael Manelis : Yes. I don\u2019t have that in front of me. I will tell you, across all of our markets, we have a range of 18 to 24 specific to New York. It is very, very few, if any, that bump up against that because our underwriting criteria against a gross rent would kind of prevent that from being anything of a significant level. Pedro Cardoso : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Michael Manelis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And there are no further questions. I would like to turn your conference back over to Mark Parrell for any additional or closing remarks. Mark Parrell : Well, thank you, everyone, for your time today and enjoy the rest of the summer. Thank you again. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. We do appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead. Marty McKenna : Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's Third Quarter 2022 Results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; and Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer. Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer, is here with us as well for the Q&A. Our earnings release and accompanying management presentation are posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now I'll turn the call over to Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Thank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our third quarter results. As you could see from our press release, Equity Residential had an outstanding quarter. Our revenue results in the quarter were driven by steady occupancy, continuing strong renewal rate growth and decelerating but still above trend, new lease rate growth. We couple that with a continuation of modest expense growth leading the same-store NOI growth for the quarter of an exceptional 16.2%. With continuing positive financial leverage, this led to a 19.5% increase in quarter-over-quarter normalized funds from operations. We are proud to have improved margins and created substantial cash flow growth in the turbulent time in the economy. I congratulate my colleagues across Equity Residential for their hard work, taking care of our residents and their fellow employees and producing these impressive financial results. We know at this late point in the year, the focus naturally turns to 2023. As usual, we are not giving guidance at this time, but in the management presentation we posted last night, we tried to frame the material factors that will drive next year's revenue results.  In a moment, Michael will take you through those factors in some detail. We remind you that the success we've had in 2022 will create a challenging comparable period. So we continue to expect a moderation in 2023 annual same-store revenue growth even if as we expect 2023 as a strong above-trend year. Looking at it from the top of the house, we like our Affluent Renter customer and what we expect will be their financial and employment resiliency going into uncertain times. Our target resident is high earning and employed in knowledge industries, with more durable incomes and employment prospects. The college graduate cohort, which we believe makes up the vast majority of our residents has an unemployment rate of 1.8% and compared to the 3.5% overall unemployment rate. Even if layoffs materialize, we believe that the tighter than average labor market for these knowledge workers will allow them to find replacement jobs quickly. Finally, although high inflation has impacted everyone's real incomes, our Affluent Renter is relatively more insulated due to their higher incomes and lower rent-to-income ratios. The average income for the residents who signed new leases with us in the past 12 months is $174,000 or 12% higher than the group who signed with us in the 12 months ending September 2021. These new residents are paying us slightly less than 20% of their income in rent, which is generally consistent with prior rent to income levels. On the apartment supply side, we see national apartment deliveries reaching a cycle high point in 2023. However, in the coastal markets where most of our properties are still located, we see supply as being lower and being delivered further away from our properties than in the past and thus likely less impactful. The Sunbelt markets, including the Denver, Dallas Fort Worth, Austin and Atlanta markets in which we are increasingly investing, will see higher relative supply numbers than our coastal established markets and likely more impact, especially if that's coupled with the job slowdown. For us, this may turn into a nice opportunity to acquire assets in these expansion markets, not necessarily at fire sale prices, but at better values than prevailed in the first half of 2022 when we felt the market was overheated and chose to stay on the sidelines. We continue to see our strategy of having more balanced portfolio between our established and expansion markets as appropriate as we follow our Affluent Renter to these new markets and mitigate regulatory and resiliency risks, from overconcentration in any market or in any state. In addition, other housing alternatives remain expensive and in low supply. Though they have been declining of late, current single-family home prices continue to be at record levels, while rising mortgage rates have further stressed affordability, particularly for first-time homebuyers. Single-family housing starts are declining, existing homeowners are more reluctant to sell due to low locked in mortgage rates along with minimal and expensive for sale replacement options and competition for homes from investors remain strong. Going against these positive factors for our business is a significant impact of inflation on the economy, where job growth goes in response to the Federal Reserve's actions as well as volatility in the capital markets, the continuing impact of the war in Ukraine and a myriad of other uncertainties. We are currently in an excellent spot but acknowledge that the risks and uncertainties are more elevated than usual. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael Manelis. Michael Manelis : Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everybody for joining to us today. I'm going to give some brief comments regarding current market conditions, and then we can turn it over to the operator for question and answers. We just completed one of the best leasing seasons in our history. Strong demand across our markets produced high occupancy as well as continued pricing power. As we think about the trajectory of our pricing for the full year, we clearly benefited from a supercharged spring leasing season with more robust pricing power that started earlier in the spring in many markets than we have traditionally seen. This strength led us to adjust our same-store revenues upward in July and to set our current expectations slightly above the midpoint or at 10.6% for the full year 2022 which is the best same-store revenue growth in our history. In both the earnings release and in the accompanying management presentation, we have provided some key performance metrics which demonstrate the strength of the leasing season and the fundamentals that position this portfolio well for 2023. This includes updates on the percentage of our residents renewing with us, which remains very healthy and is now consistent with historical levels after some moderation in the summer, which was expected as we were moving residents to current market rents. This performance supports occupancy, which continues to be solid at 96.2% even as we enter the slower part of the leasing season. As you can see on Page 4 of the accompanying management presentation and as we disclosed in our August 31 press release, our rents peaked in the first week of August and began to moderate, which is typical for this time of the year. Seattle and San Francisco are the two markets that stand out with more recent moderation than anticipated. Concessions are being used more than declines in rental rate in these markets to drive traffic. All other markets are basically in line with normal rent seasonality. And overall, we continue to have good demand for our units in all of our markets with strong foot traffic, which is generally in line with our historical averages for this time of year. While we see the same headlines as everyone else on tech hiring freezes and some layoffs, our revenue performance is holding up although we readily admit that we are a lagging indicator. Right now, New York and Southern California continue to lead in both same-store revenue growth performance and our overall current pricing fundamentals. Seattle and San Francisco, while producing strong annual same-store revenue growth are the markets that have struggled through the most of the year to gain meaningful momentum. Longer term, these 2 markets present growth opportunities as they continue to be under housed and have the potential to show improvement very quickly with the infusion of more certainty of jobs. As Mark mentioned, we are not providing 2023 guidance this quarter, but we understand that 2023 is top of mind. As a result, we provided a framework of helpful building blocks for same-store revenue and expense growth which you can find on Pages 5 through 8 of the management presentation. We would expect 2023 to produce quite good above historical average revenue growth based on activity already built into the rent roll from excellent rent growth that occurred in 2022. We call this our Forecasted Embedded Growth, which reflects the contribution to next year's revenue growth assuming no changes to the rent roll occur. We expect this to be about 4.5% by year-end. For historical context, in a normal year, our forecasted embedded growth would be just above 1%. You can see this on Page 6 of the presentation. In addition to this favorable embedded growth, we are positively positioned for leasing activity in 2023 moving forward. Our Loss to Lease which refers to the revenue improvement we can expect from moving leases in place today to current market levels is significantly larger than historical years as evident on Page 7. Our current Loss to Lease of approximately 5% will seasonally moderate through year-end, but certainly positions us for growth when leases mature and we capture this loss in '23. For historical context, our Loss to Lease would be about 50 basis points at the end of a typical non-recessionary year. With that set up in mind, let's not forget about actual market rent growth during 2023 and its contribution to same-store revenue growth. Current visibility here is most opaque. While our business has strong long-term fundamentals, the uncertainty around future economic conditions that Mark just mentioned is high. This 2023 intraperiod growth should remain healthy as favorable demographics, continued low employment rates in our target demographic, strong income growth and less direct supply pressure in many of our markets point to the potential to see a strong spring lease season. That being said, 2023 is unlikely to be as robust as the unprecedented rent growth numbers of 2022. On the occupancy side, general demand trends, including improving retention, supports strong occupancy above 96% for the balance of 2022 and should carry through into 2023, unless there is a substantial loss of jobs in our target renter demographic. Outside of occupancy and the core revenue drivers that I just discussed, bad debt net will likely continue to play a role in revenue growth as we expect the trend of reduced levels of resident delinquency to continue into 2023. The lack of governmental rental assistance in '23 compared to the $31 million we will receive in 2022 will require continued improvement in resident behavior -- payment behaviors in order to return us closer to historical norms and contribute positively to revenue growth. An improved regulatory environment, coupled with the high quality of our Affluent Renter should lead us in this direction, but 2023 may be a bit of a transition year to get all the way there. Switching to same-store expense growth. As you can see in the press release, 2022 benefited from limited growth in property tax expense and great controls of our payable expenses and as a result, we expect to produce same-store expense growth of 3.3% for the full year 2022. As we described in the management presentation, if the inflationary environment continues as it is today, we would expect expense growth in '23 to be elevated from these industry-leading levels in 2022. While we expect that less controllable areas like real estate tax may come under more pressure, we remain focused on initiatives that can assist in moderating growth in areas that are more controllable like payroll and repairs & maintenance. We have had great success in creating efficiencies in our sales and office functions with over half of our portfolio running with shared resources, and we expect that to continue to benefit us in 2023 as we centralize on-site activities such as application processing and our move-out and collection process. On the service side of the business, we continue to leverage our mobile platform to create more opportunities to part our resources across multiple properties. We also will strategically leverage third parties for outsourcing turns and assisting with afterhours work to reduce overtime pressure in the portfolio. Overall, we are well positioned to continue the trend of expanding our fully loaded net operating margin, which currently sits around 69% into 2023. I want to give a quick shout out to our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to the residents and focus on delivering these terrific operating results. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Nick Joseph with Citi. Nick Joseph : I appreciate all the building blocks on 2023. If we're looking at kind of same-store revenue growth. Obviously, the market rent will be a big determinant of it. But there's obviously these other building blocks in place already. As you think about the interplay between the ability to push renewals versus that Loss to Lease going in, how sticky can renewals be? And how are you thinking about pricing those on a forward 30 or 60 days, just given the more macroeconomic uncertainty? Michael Manelis : Yes. Nick, this is Michael. So I think when you're looking at the renewal performance, again, our quotes for the balance of the year have already been issued. So we have all of those quotes out there. And right now, we're seeing improving retention. We're negotiating a little bit more, but that's clearly typical for the fourth quarter and have a pretty strong degree of confidence that we're going to continue to achieve about 8% to 9% in growth from the renewals. So we remain very optimistic about the renewal performance and clearly are seeing the trends of improving stickiness but that is a common trend to see in the fourth quarter that, that retention continues to grow. Nick Joseph : I guess the question was more on '23, right? So as the Loss to Lease trends down towards the end of this year, just with market rent growth as you start to set rents in '23, if the Loss to Lease is smaller at that point, how comfortable are you going out earlier in the year with renewals just given normal seasonality on the market rent side? Michael Manelis : Yes. I mean I think you're going to look at what your expectations are. We'll watch what happens to us for the balance of the year and how we start January off is going to be the indicator as to how aggressive we are in March and April. But we clearly are going to layer in intraperiod growth into these quotes into the first and second quarter of next year. And then we have a great centralized negotiation team in place that we can always pivot if we need to. But right now, we're not seeing anything that tells us not to expect kind of growth in that renewal performance after we kind of start the year off. Nick Joseph : That's helpful. And then just on the pricing sensitivity, you talked about San Francisco and Seattle. I think -- you've talked about the West Coast maybe being a driver for 2023. Does the sensitivity that you're seeing today change that overall view at all? Michael Manelis : Well, I mean, I think, look, if you backed us up a few months ago, where our expectations were for 2023, and I think I alluded to it in the comments, I mean, we've got 2 markets right now that are exhibiting a little more price sensitivity than what you thought. That we would be sitting at in October. And most of that sensitivity, it's not necessarily that the rates are coming down. It's the fact that the concessions came kind of a little bit sooner in the year than what we would have thought, right? So you're seeing markets even for us in like San Francisco, where we're running 50% of our applications are now receiving about a month. In Seattle, you're at like 1/3 of the applications at about 3 weeks, that's just a little bit more pronounced than what we would have thought. So I think as we think about 2023 for those markets, I said in the prepared remarks, I still believe there's a lot of potential for those markets to deliver strong growth, we just need a little bit of clarity on that job front, a little less ambiguity. You got good momentum with the quality of life coming back in both of those areas. So I still feel like we got the potential. But sitting here today versus our view a few months ago, the markets feel a little more price sensitive than what we would have thought. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Mike, I just wanted to follow up a little follow up a little bit on the Seattle and San Francisco comment. Are those very specific to kind of downtown Seattle and Downtown San Francisco? Are you seeing any of that weakness spreads to kind of the east side of Seattle or down into the Peninsula? Michael Manelis : Yes. So we definitely felt a little bit in Redmond, a little bit more softening. A little bit of the concessions are in that marketplace. And I think in San Francisco, what you saw is the South Bay really kind of benefited through the year even though it was delivering all of that supply and right now, my guess is what we're feeling is a little bit of pressure from that hangover supply in the South Bay. So it's not completely isolated to like the downtown or the CBD areas, but it is still mostly concentrated there. Steve Sakwa : Great. And then, I don't know, maybe for Mark or for Bob. Just as you guys think about deploying new capital into new developments, how has your return hurdle changed, just given the change in cost of capital, given the change in the economy and the outlook, how much more conservative are you being on underwriting? And how high have your hurdle rates gone for new developments? Mark Parrell : Yes. Steve, it's Mark. Thanks for the question. It certainly has gone up. The 2 deals you saw us start this quarter were really things that were in play much earlier, and we were kind of obligated on. It's just the start that occurred. So we have let go of some deals we were pursuing. We have talked a lot with the development team about the higher hurdle. I'm not sure I have a precise number for you, but it was probably a number we were looking more like a 5% return on in-place rents. And now we're looking for something, Steve, probably a lot closer to a 6% return on in-place rents, but you've got deals where there might be a story that's particularly compelling. You like your basis play or some other factor that makes it particularly interesting. I'll also say the big competitor to development with us is acquisitions. I mean our sense is that pretty soon, pretty soon might be a few more months though, the acquisition market will be more available to us, again, not at free prices, not at fire sale prices. But boy, if we can buy existing streams of income without having all that development risk, we'll lean in on that. So my sense is that acquisitions of existing assets will be more available to us at more favorable prices than a correction in the development market. So to answer your question, I think the hurdle is higher for us to start new development both because of cost of capital and because of the ability to deploy that capital instead in acquisitions. Operator : And we will take our next question from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : I just maybe following up on that capital markets kind of outlook. Mark, I mean how are you thinking about how cap rates maybe have changed for apartment assets given that when we look today, I mean even to get GSE debt for multifamily, the radar on that, all-in is going to be somewhere close to 6%. We're hearing negative leverage is more of a problem for people underwriting assets. I mean what is your view on how that may affect cap rates? Mark Parrell : Yes. And I'm going to take -- thanks for the question, Nick. I'm going to take cap rates and sort of make it in the values in general. I mean the system definitely got a shock. We talked about that on the last call. There's a pretty big bid-ask spread out there. Sellers are saying to themselves, 6, 9 months ago, I could have gotten a much higher price. I'm still getting good cash flow growth, as Michael Manelis just described. Maybe I'll sit on my hands for a while. And buyers are sitting there going, Wow, all risk assets have repriced, apartments should reprice too. So our sense is that this lack of activity, I mean, transaction volume is just really low now. It's really hard to peg value. But our sense is that cap rates have moved from maybe a 3.5% to something like a 5% cap rate for well-located stuff. And to your point, that still requires negative leverage, negative cash flow for a bit. So that is, I think, a problem. And that's why you don't see a lot transacting. On the flip side, people like the apartment business. I mean there is a real dearth of these sorts of inflation, protective investments in apartments, we've done a lot of research on this, have typically performed pretty well in inflationary climates. There's also, by our count, $375 billion or so of dry powder available in real estate private equity funds looking for a home and apartments are a favorite place to invest in. So we think there's a lot of supportive stuff but right now, there's just not a lot of transaction activity. And our sense is that, again, values are down probably 10% plus. And some of that reason, they're not down more is because of this offset from increasing cash flow. Nick Yulico : Okay. Great. Just another question on the balance sheet. You guys did, I guess, pay down some of 2023 maturities with the sales this quarter. Is it right that -- I mean just from reading this, you have something like $500 million of kind of unhedged exposure to -- on a maturity next year based on the swaps you have in place? Bob Garechana : Yes, slightly less than that. We have about $825 million of debt that is maturing next year that needs to be refinanced. $800 million of it needs to be refinanced as secured, of which we've got $350 million of at this point, very attractively priced swaps against it managing those -- the treasury risk. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. Chandni Luthra : Mark, I'd like to go back to that acquisition point. So you guys talked about that there can be potential opportunity and therefore, the grid might look better in terms of acquisitions versus development. What sort of opportunities do you think can come from this environment? Like is there a way to contextualize it? We understand it cannot be as good as 2021 likely, but can it look something like 2020 or maybe even 2019 from a volume standpoint? And then how would you think about funding it, given we are still in that negative leverage territory and you said that prices might come down, but not at fire sale levels? Mark Parrell : Chandni, it's Mark. Thanks for that great question. You really hit on it because you really need to split this into 2 pieces. What do you feel about the asset price, and we'll talk about that in a second. And where are you getting the money from. And so talking about asset price we already like where it's headed, where these assets are being talked about, again, not a lot of transactions, but a lot of these sales that are being discussed are -- don't have that big premium to replacement cost.  At the end of '21, the beginning of this year, we saw transactions where acquisitions were being done at 25%, 30% premiums to replacement cost. You saw us stand down. We just don't see a history of making a lot of money when you pay those kind of premiums. So we see the price change as having evaporated a good amount of that, and we see deals being talked about, at least for sale much closer to replacement costs. So we like that. So when we think about asset pricing, replacement cost figures in, the cap rate certainly figures in the price per pound. All those things matter to us. But where we get the money? Because we're going to continue to trade out of some of these existing markets, D.C., the State of California, New York, so where do those assets trade on a relative basis compared to these expansion markets. And if they trade in a way that makes sense to us, i.e., in a nondilutive way, that will be more interesting to us. In terms of deploying new capital, which would have to be raised with debt, right now, we think our unsecured debt rate is probably 5.75, something like that. That's a pretty mighty interest rate to overcome and cap rates being around 5 aren't going to push that. And again, looking at where the stock is trading, that doesn't make a lot of sense. So for us to be net acquirers is going to require, I think, some shift in our capital costs. For us to be swappers of assets like we've been, traders is going to require that trade to make sense and then for asset values to make sense. And they are starting to, on a replacement cost basis. But I think your guidepost 2018, 2019 is a pretty good guidepost because I think what happened in the pandemic with ultra-low rates, that was the distortion, but I also don't think very high rates is a permanent future either. Chandni Luthra : That's very helpful color. And switching gears to the expense side of the equation just a little bit. What are the markets in your portfolio where you think real estate taxes could pose a bigger problem? And then on payroll, is there any more low-hanging fruit as you think about streamlining that line item further, just given where compares are going into next year? Bob Garechana : Chandni, it's Bob. I'll start with the payroll tax side. I think the most prevalent or probably the area that you see the most pressure already is really in some of our expansion markets, particularly Texas, where you're seeing an aggressive amount of kind of reassessment activity and kind of push. So I think that's going to be an area in the expansion markets where we don't have a ton of exposure at the moment, but where you will see more real estate tax pressure. The state of Washington is also one that is an area because it's been so negative, right? So real estate tax growth has actually been negative. So you have a really challenging comp. And the final area, I think, where you're going to see it is just we do have some 421-a step-ups in New York State, which will contribute to growth as we go into 2023. So a little bit of a mixed bag, but those are the 3 areas I'd call out specifically. And I'll pass it over to Michael, who will mention some of the initiatives on the payroll side. Michael Manelis : Yes. So I think on the payroll front, I don't think I'd characterize any of this as like low-hanging fruit left. I think this is really just the strategic execution of these initiatives. And if I sit here today, I would tell you, we're probably about 2/3 of the way from many of these centralized initiatives, and that usually yields kind of that efficiency in the on-site payroll team as we start sharing and leveraging resources across assets. So I'm pretty optimistic that as we work our way through 2023, there's probably 1/3 of the work left to be done with centralization and it's going to continue to yield kind of the benefits that will help mitigate some of the pressures that we're feeling. Operator : Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Haendel St. Juste : So a couple questions here. I guess the first is a follow-up to an earlier question on sort of capital allocation. I'm curious what is the best use of your capital today? You did take $500 million of disposition proceeds to prepay some of the bond maturity. So perhaps some color on, as you think about uses for capital today, thoughts on further debt reduction, stock buyback. And then maybe also, what is the plan for the remaining $900 million of the unsecured bond maturities for next spring? Mark Parrell : All right. You had like a 4-part question, Haendel. And thank you. So I'm going to take parts of it all the way up to stock buybacks, and I'll ask Bob to speak to the refinancing plan for next year. So when you talk about immediate capital allocation, our hope is that we can accelerate our renovations a little more. We've got a lot of great, super well-located properties where we touch ups in the kitchen and bath and stuff, especially if rent growth is going to moderate for a bit, our experience has been that, that's a good time to do these renovations, then when things start to accelerate again, you've got some better product to sell. We're hopeful that, that also means that some of these labor pressures that we've alluded to and others have to, start to abate next year. You've got less action in single family. Maybe there's an opportunity because we're really having trouble getting contractors and sometimes getting things like appliances for renovation. So renovation is a good use of capital. You should expect us to try and accelerate that. Again, these are all near-term things. Innovation expenditures, so this relates both to our terrific presentation inside the company this week about all we want to do relating to sustainability and whether it's solar panels and EV charging and all that. A lot of that stuff is pretty capital-intensive. A good part of it has some returns, which is great. Some doesn't. But I think we're going to -- you're going to see us lean in there, both as part of our thought process on ESG in general and because of the return and the demands of our residents. And finally, just the innovation part. We've kicked off a big data analytics push inside the company. That is expensive, both in terms of talent and outside help. In the long run, we think it will help us drive revenue, manage expenses better, run the business better in general. But those are all areas where we're spending money. On the share buyback, and you and I have had this conversation publicly and privately in the past, it's really hard, though, in this case to even think about it in a market where things are this uncertain. We just talked about how hard it is to peg underlying asset values. So to really understand the relationship of your stock to underlying asset values and sort of do that arbitrage you are referring to, is a very challenging thing right now. Doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t think the stock has room to go up, certainly. But just at the moment, taking more risk, which would mean either issuing debt or selling assets into an uncertain asset sale environment. It just doesn't make a lot of sense. So I wouldn't say share buybacks are top of mind at the moment. Bob Garechana : And then following up, big picture on the balance sheet, we feel very good about where the balance sheet is. We expect to actually end the balance sheet at record low net debt to EBITDA. By the end of the year, we'll probably be in the mid-4s. We're already at 5 as it is. So the balance sheet is in great shape, is very long duration, has limited kind of interest rate exposure, and we have almost no floating rate. So we feel really well positioned. As we think about moving into 2023, the component of debt or the piece of debt that is due or the majority of it is actually a piece of secured debt that is $800 million that was done originally in context with the Archstone transaction and has some structural requirements that will require us to refinance it. So what we're anticipating is that we'll refinance it in the secured market and then we put on some hedges, some attractively priced hedges to manage the interest rate risk. And thereafter, in '24, we have no maturities at all, so which is an anomaly, right? So when you look at the $800 million or so we need to do over the next 2 years, it's very manageable. Haendel St. Juste : On the cost of the new potentials -- debt, the arrangement that you just mentioned, where are you pegging that cost broadly for -- for new debt? Bob Garechana : Yes. So this would be secured pricing, which is actually inside of unsecured right now. So if you looked at the GSEs for -- and relatively low leverage because this is a very well-supported kind of pool, you're probably without regard to the hedges we have in place, you're probably in the 5.5 range, so about 25 basis points below what Mark had mentioned on the unsecured side. When you factor into the swaps that we already have in place that hedge a portion of it at kind of treasury rates that are effective around a 3, we should be able to execute closer to 5 or maybe even sub-5 depending on what happens. This loan matures very late in 2023. So we have a long runway before we actually need to refinance. Mark Parrell : And really just to give you some more color hand out, the existing rate isn't just the listed rate there. There are hedges that went with that portfolio. So the actual rate running through the P&L is. Bob Garechana : 4.25%. Mark Parrell : 4.25%. So when you think about your modeling exercise, as Bob said, for really what will amount to the last month or 2 of 2023 and then going forward, it's really the difference between 4.25% and wherever Bob ends up financing this. And we've got the luxury of another year to see if we can pick a spot to do that in. Haendel St. Juste : That's really helpful. Mark, one more follow-up, and I promise this looks a lot shorter, only -- maybe 2 parts. But cap rates you mentioned moving from about 3.5% to around 5% for well-located assets. I'm curious if you're seeing any distinction between Coastal and Sunbelt? And if so, how that might play into your plans of rotating more of your NOI into Sunbelt markets maybe a bit sooner or any thoughts on that? Mark Parrell : Yes. Thanks, Haendel. I don't have any thoughts on that just because the transaction pool is so light. There's so little going on in any market, just sharing anecdotally, a large national broker told us that a large southeastern apartment market, they didn't have a single listing at this time. So then that's unprecedented. So I just got to tell you, the markets are just not very liquid. And so for me to be able to peg Coastal or Sunbelt, I wish I could peg anything right now. I think right now, it's just a little bit of everyone feeling each other out. What's the Fed going to do? How is that going to feel? Do operating results hold up? All of those things, and all, I think, are a little bit in flux. But as I said in my prior remarks, we're really interested in the relationship between those 2. And if we can continue to nondilutively trade, we will. Operator : Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Rich Anderson : So back to that kind of Sunbelt question. People think of EQR as an urban platform at this point. Understanding you're diversifying and looking into the Sunbelt in your expansion markets, but the big fear there is supply, and that now is becoming a reality, and that doesn't just suddenly start and then stop. It becomes a thing to deal with for some period of time. So is there a scenario despite what you just said that this trade idea into expansion markets where opportunities present themselves because of some of those supply pressures does not materialize and you start to look at these expansion markets and say, yes, maybe this isn't exactly where we want to go because do we really want to get in bed with an extended period of supply growth, which is, again, the big fear of getting into those markets if there are any? Mark Parrell : Yes. Great question, Rich. It's Mark. So it would require us to think about another risk differently, too, and that's political risk because one of the things that our coastal markets have, I think, more of though maybe not quite as much of as we may have thought, is risk of rent control, risk of activity by politicians that's job destroying and growth destroying. So from our perspective, we'd have to be balancing that differently as well. There is no risk-free apartment market. So if you're in Texas market, you probably have less political risk, but you may have more resiliency risk and you certainly have a lot more supply risk than a lot of our markets. But our experience with supply in the locations we're trying to buy in and build in like Frisco, Texas is, you'll have a year or 2 of that, and then demand will need debt supply. So again, if you're telling me that prices get out of whack, that somehow the Sunbelt trades tight even with all that supply, that's probably not stuff we're going to be acquiring or building much of. But if the pricing relationship makes sense, then we're trying to manage this political risk versus the supply risk and I think balancing that out makes sense to us. So that's kind of where we end up on that. Rich Anderson : Okay. And then second question for me, one parter, by the way. The embedded growth math, you define it as last month annualized and you get to 4.5% for 2023. But is there another mathematical equation where you think further back into 2022? A lease that was signed in July at 20% higher rent would compare favorably in January. And so my question is, is the 4.5% one number, but is there another \"embedded\" growth calculation that might be substantially higher than that giving voice to leases that were signed late second quarter, third quarter and so on? Mark Parrell : Rich, it's Mark. I'm going to start, and I think Bob and Michael may end up correcting me. But I think that's the embedded growth in loss. You're talking about more of a Loss to Lease a little bit in there, and we split those 2 up. So if you think about it, embedded is the rearview mirror. Those are already contracts that have been written leases that exist. And in your example, that Loss to Lease is us writing up to market. So if January rents are say, relatively low. And then as we would expect, seasonally, they're higher in June and the lease you just referred to in June is written higher. That additional increment we were referring to is that Loss to Lease and has the intraperiod growth. So we're talking about the same thing. We just kind of compartmentalized it a little differently because it was a little easier to think about in 3 pieces. Rich Anderson : Okay. That's fair. So maybe my definition of embedded is Loss to Lease plus your definition of embedded, maybe that's the way to think of it. Mark Parrell : You had a one-part question and we split it into 3 parts, right? But we are just -- we're just chopping it up a little different because it seems to us, those are different variables and easier to explain, but I think you're on it. Operator : Our next question comes from Robyn Luu with Green Street. Robyn Luu : So I wanted to ask across the portfolio. As eviction processes begin to normalize in some of your markets, are you seeing an erosion in pricing power as market level vacancies tick up? Michael Manelis : Yes. So Robin, this is Michael. Maybe let me just give you a little context overall around the eviction moratorium and kind of what we're seeing today relative to that activity. So for the most part, the moratoriums have generally expired. We still have a couple of these local areas in California where there's various proof of hardships and restrictions. And all of -- most of these exceptions are set to expire in the beginning of early 2023. I'm going to tell you right now that the teams today are all over this process of continuing to work with these residents who've experienced hardship. And once we've exhausted all those options, we're ensuring that we have everything filed properly. We are still in the very early stages of this eviction court process. And we are starting to see some traction where the courts are actually moving through and following through kind of with lockouts. Overall, this level of eviction activity in the portfolio is just -- it's not that material, and we typically average less than like 1% of our move-outs from -- for this reason. So I would tell you, even if everything was accelerated through the court system today, the volume would be more than manageable and would actually be a huge positive to us given the strength in the demand and the confidence we have in being able to fill those units with paying residents. Short term, I think going specific to your question, sure. We're going to feel a little bit of this occupancy pressure or loss of occupancy pockets of Southern California. But again, the demand is so strong that we're going to quickly recover from that. And I don't really see it playing into kind of the pricing. And I think our view right now is that the expectation you're just going to see us gradually fall back into this pre-pandemic level of eviction activity as we work our way through 2023. Bob Garechana : And Robyn, it's Bob. Just to add real quick. If you think about those residents that are residing and not paying, they're fully reserved from a financial standpoint. So that occupancy -- that physical occupancy coming back into the market and us kind of capturing it like Michael just mentioned, is a dollar for dollar, 100% upside to financial results because whether it's $0.50 less a month or before, it's a full rental payment more than what's going through the financial statement. So it's a big net benefit. Robyn Luu : Got it. That makes sense. So I wanted to touch on San Francisco and Seattle a little bit more. So can you give a sense of the retention and foot traffic trends that you're seeing in both of those markets? And how those have really compared to like the 2019 levels? Michael Manelis : Yes. So this is Michael again, Robyn. So the Seattle market today is renewing a little bit less than what we would say our historical averages would be. San Francisco is -- again, it's more in line, but it's also a little bit lighter from a foot traffic and a application volume standpoint, both markets demonstrate demand. And I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, it\u2019s just at a little bit lower, more price-sensitive level than what we would have expected. But when we're looking at this volume and comparing it to like '19 week after week, we are seeing the foot traffic. We are seeing the conversions to applications. It's just at a little bit less of a price point. And our hope right now as we get through this fourth quarter and turn the corner into the year, we will see this retention start to improve and take a little bit of the pressure off of the front door, and we are seeing slight trends of that right now, but we need a little bit more momentum and time to kind of clarify on that. Operator : Our next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Joshua Dennerlein : I just wanted to touch on supply. What are you seeing for 2023? And for Seattle and San Francisco, how much of the supply dynamic was playing into that price sensitivity that you guys were referring to? Michael Manelis : Yes. So this is Michael. Let me start with Seattle and San Francisco. So I think clearly in Downtown Seattle, we're feeling some of the pressure from the new supply in that market. And San Francisco, like I said, I think earlier in one of the responses to a question, maybe a little bit in South Bay that they had a lot of supply. These markets are set to deliver less supply next year, so taking a little bit of the pressure off. And maybe with that, I'll just transition to kind of an overarching view of supply for '23, which is for us, we're very focused on this concentration, the proximity of the new supply and from an operations standpoint, when are the first units going to actually start hitting the market to be leasing. And when we look forward, these expected starts in '23 relative to the proximity within like 1 or 2 miles of our locations is lower than previous years, which is a really good indicator that we should continue to feel less pressure from the new supply being right on top of us. Specific to '23 deliveries, I would say that the overall direct pressure will be less. But clearly, like the D.C. market stands out as needing to see marked improvement in absorption because it has like another 15,000 units coming online with slightly more of an impact from a competitive standpoint to our portfolio. And then outside of D.C., look, we're going to have some pockets in L.A. like Wilshire, Koreatown, Hollywood, where we expect to have some pressure next year. And in addition to that, I think the Downtown submarket in Denver, we're going to face some direct kind of head to head. And besides those buckets, every year, we have these small isolated pockets of supply but as we look into '23, we just see that we're going to have fewer of those concentrated pockets, and we're just not going to have as much kind of direct pressure on us. And I think when we stand back and look at this, this portfolio with these amazing locations are clearly in places where affluent renters want to live and still have these good demand drivers and that definitely insulates us from some of this direct pressure from the supply. Operator : Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : I wanted to ask about your forecasted earning of 4.5%. Based on leases you signed this year, I would have thought it would have been maybe 50 to 100 basis points higher than that. So I was wondering if you could talk about the factors that drove this, whether it's purely 4Q rents declining? Or if there are other factors like occupancy and bad debt that are in this number? And is there a chance that the earnings could come in higher than your current estimate? Bob Garechana : John, it's Bob. So just level setting real quick on earn-in/embedded growth, which we do think of them as pretty interchangeable. They don't have any regard to bad -- like this has no regard to bad debt, no regard to vacancy loss, now any of that. My guess is, and I'm not -- and maybe you can help me a little bit on how you're getting to your number is that you're maybe taking -- taking blended rates and kind of averaging blended rates over the year and coming up with that number is my guess on how you're coming with your 50 basis points higher than what our embedded number is. Is that how you're approaching it? John Kim : Yes, pretty much. Adjusting for timing of lease time, but -- Bob Garechana : Yes. And I guess what I would tell you is that the difference is really waiting. So the way that we're calculating it really has actual waiting day by day as to when leases are in place. So took my blended lease rates over the year and just kind of extrapolated and did a mid-quarter convention, et cetera, I'd probably come up with a number that's around a 5%. But if you actually do the pinpoint map, which we provided you, that's the 4.5%. That number shouldn't move almost at all. It's our forecasted number for the end of the year. So that number really shouldn't move much at all as we go into -- as we finish out the year based on our guidance. Does that help? John Kim : Yes, it does. And Bob, while I have you, the Loss to Lease, I know it's come down from 12.5% to a little bit over 5% and a lot of it was the leases you signed during the quarter to realize the market rents. But can you also talk about how much market rents have declined as part of that Loss to Lease number since your last update? Bob Garechana : Yes, I'll pass it over to Michael. I think if you look a good visual as I pass it over to him, is that pricing trend page, which is a couple of pages before, maybe Page 5 in the management presentation and you can kind of see that sequential trend, but that will help you directionally. And Michael, you probably have that. Michael Manelis : Yes. No, John, I was just going to point you right to that page. And if you look at kind of the month end rent numbers, down below in that chart, you can kind of get yourself a proxy to understand depending on which month you pick up the peak -- lease, it's 4% or 5% off of kind of that August number and just work your way through that. But I'll tell you, when you think about that Loss to Lease and you think about the shifts that have occurred with the deceleration in that number, it's really important to understand like that comparative period. If you're looking back to that summer period and saying, boy, you guys were 11% or 12%, and now you're sitting down closer to 5%, you need to remember that the majority of this decline is this seasonality that you can kind of see evident on Page 4, but also every lease and every renewal that we have done since that point, we are capturing that Loss to Lease that we shared from a while ago. And overall, the Loss to Lease it may be a little bit lighter than where we thought it was going to be a few months ago. But I'll tell you, just -- it is directionally and definitely right in the ballpark of where we modeled this thing for a few months ago. So we're just not seeing it. And I think that Page 4 really kind of highlights as to how you can think about that trend. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ami Probandt with UBS. Michael Goldsmith : It's Michael Goldsmith. Over the last couple of years, you saw residents requiring more space and decoupling. Have you seen any of that reverse as we've moved past COVID? And then related to that, have move out due to high rent -- doing rent fee too high increased, presumably, people aren't moving out to purchase a new home anymore. So where are they now moving to? Michael Manelis : Michael, this is Michael. So on a decoupling or even a recoupling basis, we're just not seeing a material change. I think during this pandemic recovery period we've alluded to on the last call, we saw a slight decline in like the average adults per household. We ran about [1.65] and we were down at like [1.57]. And that was really more prevalent in our one bedroom unit types where we used to have 2 adults and they moved into a 2-bedroom or did something different. So -- we looked at this even for the third quarter of these move-ins, which there's some seasonality of that when do the 3-bedrooms fill up and stuff like that. And we're right on par with where we were in the third quarter of last year. So we haven't really observed any of these material changes. But I'll tell you, we've got great insight into it. We're watching the transfer behaviors. We're watching roommate activity. We're looking at unit type preferences on our website for prospects. And we'll be on it if we see anything shifting, we just haven't seen anything shift yet. And then in terms of kind of the reasons for move out, I mean you alluded to the home buying, you're absolutely correct. That number is materially down. During the third quarter, we're at like 8% of our move-out sited, home buying is the reason for move out. That's compared to like a 12% norm. But we did see a tick up in that rent is too expensive as a reason we're up at like 25%. Part of that was by design. We said this at the end of the second quarter that we were going to be fairly aggressive in July and August kind of pushing these renewals and holding the line and getting people up to market. So we knew we were going to take a little bit of that hit, and we expected that number to go up. As we work our way through the fourth quarter and first quarter, my guess is we're going to continue to kind of see that number moderate down. But I don't anticipate seeing reasons for move-out to buy home, materially change at all. My guess is it's going to stay very low. Michael Goldsmith : As a quick follow-up to that. With those that indicated that rent was too high, did you see any variations by region? Presumably certain areas of the country are used to kind of elevated rents and rents moving higher over time, whereas maybe this phenomenon is relatively new. So did you see any difference by market or region? Michael Manelis : Not a huge difference. I'll tell you in California where you had 1482 and you had some of the CPI plus 5 caps, maybe a little bit less, we're citing that because they were going out at 9% or 10% increases against the market that was up 19% or 20%. So those folks typically stuck around because they didn't have a lot of options. I look at like overall, I will tell you, when you just look and Mark alluded to this in his prepared remarks, is the health of the new residents moving into this portfolio from an income standpoint, our income -- rent as a percent of income is right in line at 19%, which, to me, kind of points to this fact that these new residents moving in are clearly going to be able to absorb kind of future increases that we push through into the portfolio. Michael Goldsmith : Got it. And as a follow-up question, suburban properties have been generally outperforming kind of in following the initial COVID period. But we\u2019re seeing a shift back to urban. Like what does the current demand picture look like for suburban versus urban? And does that kind of -- does it look different in different markets where there's -- where some markets are favoring urban more than suburban and the reverse is true? Michael Manelis : Yes. So I mean, overall, we're not seeing a significant shift of like urban and suburban. We look at migration patterns, where are people coming to us, where are people leaving and what is the renewal patterns look like? And there's nothing that really pops out. I think clearly, when you look at like a Seattle, San Francisco and some of these urban markets, we continue to see this trend where we are drawing in new residents from a wider area from outside of the states, from outside of the MSAs, which we view as a positive, meaning that these markets are continuing to draw people from all over kind of the country and even the foreign markets. But nothing that's really like a delineation that I can point to between urban and suburban that says they're acting materially different. Operator : Our next question comes from Connor Mitchell with Piper Sandler. Connor Mitchell : I have 2 questions. First, I do just want to revisit the San Francisco and Seattle price sensitivity once more. And I guess my question is, what do you guys see as being the largest reason for the price sensitivity? I know we talked about the supply pressure compared to other markets. It's also more concentrated in the urban areas. So does this seem that the supply pressure is the primary cause? Or is there push back to return to office is a large reason or perhaps another reason for the sensitivity and the concessions in these markets? Michael Manelis : Yes. So this is Michael. So I mean clearly, I think you cited a lot of those reasons in San Francisco and Seattle. Early on, there was an ambiguity around return to office. There's still a little bit of a kind of a sense of, okay, what does hybrid work really look and feel like across the tax. Clearly, you've seen the press releases out or the articles being written on all the recent announcements, which just creates a pause in people's minds around jobs and what are these folks doing with layoffs and growth. When I look at it right now, again, I think this is like a material -- immaterial kind of change that we're seeing. It's the markets that didn't really recover as much and I think what you're seeing is a market trying to hold on to rates where they are and use concessions more than let that rate kind of moderate down. Connor Mitchell : Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question is regarding the Toll Brothers JV. And then in the current environment with the rapid rise in mortgage rates, has it impacted their willingness to do JVs with you guys, it doesn't mean more or less demand for the products and then whether they're more or less eager for a JV? Mark Parrell : It's Mark. Thanks for that question. We were just with them last week, and they remain very committed to the joint venture as do we. Like us, they realize the market's moved and new deals have to hurdle over a higher number and have to make sense in this new environment. So they're adjusting, but there's no -- we sense no lack of commitment either on the personnel or capital side from Toll and there's none from us as long as the deals make sense. And I think that's the challenge right now. We're just not seeing deals that make sense because they're kind of priced in the old scheme. And as I said earlier in my remarks, the price system has changed and development yields need to be higher. Operator : We'll take our next question from Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Adam Kramer : I'll keep it quick here with just one. Just looking at kind of the drivers of the same-store revenue growth for 2023. Look, I think the embedded growth, I appreciate the color earlier. I think that's hopefully should be kind of well understood. But wondering though in kind of the occupancy and then the bad debt side, occupancy may look like it was just a very moderate kind of step down in September versus -- October versus September. Wondering kind of what the view is as we kind of get into next year and kind of the view on occupancy? I think you called it healthy physical occupancy, would love to just kind of elaborate on that. And then I guess similarly on bad debt, right, currently 225 basis points versus historical norms of 50. With some of this kind of improved regulatory environment, where could that potentially take bad debt next year? And again, kind of just thinking about potential impact on same-store revenue growth in those building blocks? Michael Manelis : Adam, this is Michael. Maybe I'll start and just hit on the occupancy and I'll turn it over to Bob to talk about the bad debt. So for us, when I'm describing healthy occupancy, to me, that's running in a range of 96% to 96.5%. And I think right now, it's too early for us to say. We'll expect in the fourth quarter, occupancy does tail off a little bit. You're seeing it in this portfolio. It's not unusual, what we're seeing. The health when you turn the corner into January and how we're looking and feeling about that intraperiod job growth is really going to be how we kind of put into our model as to what the expectations are. But right now, I will tell you, we still feel very comfortable saying that we expect next year to be in that range of what we would define as a healthy occupancy. Bob Garechana : Yes. And from a bad debt standpoint, we do think over time that we should see a return back to kind of our normalized levels, which were pre-pandemic, the 50 basis points you highlighted. Just given the nature of our resident base and their rent to income ratios and all the positive things that we've talked about on this call. The challenge from a financial standpoint or a financial statement standpoint or something to keep in mind is that in 2022, we had about $31 million worth of rental assistance and that's not going to repeat itself in 2023, right? So in order for you to break even from a growth perspective on same-store revenue, organic kind of bad debt has to improve by at least $31 million, from there is when you would then see it start be a contributor to growth.  All that being said, we have seen improvement in just the actual payment from our residents every month kind of sequentially since June or so and would expect that trend to continue. But it's a little bit of a race between that trend and this bad debt or this rental assistance that we won't have in 2023. But we're optimistic that we will return over time to normalized levels. Operator : Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Linda Tsai : Just one, I know you're indicating that expenses go up for next year, but can you remind us why you've had greater success than competitors in capping expense growth and whether these competitive advantages are impact on a relative basis for '23? Bob Garechana : Yes, I'll start and Michael can add in if you like. I think in the areas that are controllable -- are most controllable, our innovation focus has really been on eliminating or reducing the amount of labor cost exposure, which has been something that has been very prevalent in the inflationary environment. So I think that we've done an excellent job of rethinking where we can use technology, where we can mitigate labor exposure, ours or contract labor. It doesn't really matter what labor there is just by being more efficient by using technology, by increasing visibility and a lot of the initiatives we've had have really helped us deliver what has really been record kind of payroll growth and has kept the R&M line on the contract side a little bit more in check, even though there are other pressures there. So that's certainly been a big help and something that we are going to continue to focus on as we go through generation, I'll call it, 3.0 of innovation. The other area that, in all candor has also helped us as real estate taxes, right? We have benefited from in our jurisdictions having lower real estate taxes overall, and that was, I think, very prevalent in 2022. Is not as likely to repeat itself as we go into 2023 because I think as assessors look back, they typically look back at historical performance, and we've had record performance in our markets in 2022. And so that's going to put pressure on the real estate tax side that is a little less controllable. And I guess the final part on real estate tax side is that in California, of course, you do benefit from Prop 13. So you've got kind of 2% baked in there. But in the other jurisdictions, we'll have some pressure. Operator : This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back to Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Thank you all for your time on the call and your interest in Equity Residential, and we look forward to seeing everyone during the conference season. Thank you. Bye.

At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Please go ahead, sir. Marty McKenna : Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential\u2019s fourth quarter 2022 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; and Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer. Alec Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer is here with us as well for the Q&A. Our earnings release is posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue, because of subsequent events. Now, I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Thanks Marty. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and our outlook for 2023. 2022 was a terrific year for Equity Residential. We finished the year, as we expected, producing same-store revenue growth of 10.6%. We continued to see good demand during the fourth quarter, but certainly saw a return of seasonality to the business. Our strong 2022 same-store revenue growth combined with modest expense growth of 3.6% resulted in same-store net operating income growth for the full year of 14.1%. With continuing positive financial leverage, this led to a 17.7% increase in year-over-year normalized FFO. I want to take a moment, thank all my colleagues across Equity Residential for their hard work and dedication in delivering these terrific results. In a moment, Michael Manelis will take you through our 2022 highlights and how we expect 2023 to shape up on the revenue side; and Bob Garechana will comment on bad debt and review our 2022 expense results and 2023 expense expectations, as well as recent balance sheet activities and then we will take your questions. We have provided guidance for same-store revenue growth at a midpoint of 5.25%, which would make 2023 another good year for Equity Residential and produce same-store revenue growth well above our long-term average. We do admit to finding 2023 harder to predict than usual. On the positive side, we go into the year, expecting a benefit from embedded growth of about 4.2% from leases written in 2022 and we also carry into the year and above average loss to lease, both of which will contribute to positive momentum for us, particularly in the first half of 2023. We also feel good about the employability and earnings power of our affluent renter customer. There still appears to be plentiful employment opportunities for the highly skilled workers that formed the bulk of our residents as evidenced by last week\u2019s blowout January employment and job openings reports. We saw big increases in employment in the professional and business services category, a smaller gain in financial activities and only a modest decline in information services, all big employment categories for our residents. So far the announced layoffs at tech and some financial firms while certainly creating a negative environment have not manifested themselves much in the government\u2019s reported numbers, or thus far in our internal numbers. We\u2019ve only seen a handful of residents terminating leases early due to job loss. Possibly the impact is delayed due to severance and other factors. But it is at least equally possible that the workers in these categories are being quickly reabsorbed into the job market. Our renter demographic has proven resilient in the past, and we expect them to continue to be highly employable. As to renter incomes, according to the Atlanta Fed wage tracker, college graduates wages accelerated in the fourth quarter, outpacing wage gains achieved by hourly workers despite the higher base. Looking at competition from home ownership and new apartment supply in 2023, we also generally see a favorable picture. Homeownership costs and down-payment requirements remain high in our markets, especially relative to rents, making our product to better value. According to the National Association of Realtors, for their affordability index to return to pre-COVID levels, one of three things will need to occur : The 30-year mortgage rate will need to decline to 2.6%; home prices to fall by 1/3, our family incomes to increase by 50%. This is all very consistent with our internal data, which shows the percentage of residents leaving us to purchase a home fell to 9.4% in the fourth quarter from 15.8% a year ago. On the apartment supply side, we expect 2023 national new supply to run at record levels. But we generally feel good about the direct level of competition that we will face given our market mix and importantly, the location of supply within markets relative to our properties. The Sunbelt markets, including the Dallas Fort Worth, Austin and Atlanta markets, in which we are increasingly investing and Denver, will see higher relative supply numbers in our coastal established markets and likely more impact, especially if that\u2019s coupled with a job slowdown. In terms of supply in our coastal established markets, where we still have 95% of our properties. Our internal research indicates that new apartments delivered near to our properties create significantly more short-term pressure on our results. As we look at 2023\u2019s expected deliveries through that lens, new supply within close proximity to our properties in our coastal established markets is actually forecasted to be below pre-pandemic levels with only the Washington D.C. and Orange County market screening as delivering above average supply close to our properties relative to these pre-pandemic supply averages. And over the next decade, the significant net deficit of housing across the country sets us up for good long-term demand. We do, however, fully acknowledge that despite what was good GDP growth in the fourth quarter and full year and continuing strong employment reports, the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate actions are likely to pressure job growth and economic growth as 2023 progresses. We took this into account in our guidance by assuming a lower rate of rental rate growth during 2023 than usual and a decline in occupancy. But whether there is or isn\u2019t a technical recession is of considerably less importance to us than whether job growth substantially declines and if so when. A decline at the beginning of our spring leasing season will be considerably more impactful than a slowdown later in the year. We also now expect that the elevated post-pandemic level of bad debt in some of our California markets does improve in \u201823 but at a slower rate than we previously hoped, as poor public policies encouraging delinquency continue. Bob will discuss all this in a moment. In sum, we make no prediction about a recession but have assumed some impact to our 2023 results from a job slowdown and flawed government policy and evictions, while continuing to see sources of strength in our business in the form of modest forward competition from home purchases and new apartment supply, the high employment ability of our residents even if the job market deteriorates from its current lofty levels, and the positive forward momentum from our strong 2022 results. On the transaction front, there was not much activity in 2022 for us. We only purchased one deal and we sold three others, two in New York City and one in Washington D.C. We did start a handful of new developments. These were mostly in our Toll joint venture structure. As we head into 2023, the transaction markets remain unsettled, but we see higher than usual supply in the Sunbelt and Denver markets in which we wish to expand as hopefully creating buying opportunities for us later in the year. For now, our guidance does not assume any acquisition or disposition activity, but remain committed to our strategy of shifting capital out of California, New York and Washington D.C., and into our expansion markets of Denver, Dallas Fort Worth, Austin and Atlanta, as well as the suburbs and markets like Seattle and Boston, assuming appropriate opportunities present themselves. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Michael. Michael Manelis : Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everybody for joining us today. This morning, I will review key takeaways from our fourth quarter 2022 performance, expectations for 2023 and provide some color on the markets before I turn it over to Bob to walk through our financial guidance. 2022 same-store revenue growth of 10.6% was the best in EQR\u2019s history of nearly 30 years as a public company. Reported turnover for both the full year and the fourth quarter was the lowest in the Company\u2019s history, reflecting great demand that produced high occupancy and significant pricing power. In most of our markets, we had a supercharged spring leasing season with more robust pricing power that started earlier than usual in the year. Rents peaked in August, which is typical and then started to seasonally moderate, which is also typical. The seasonal moderation was a little more pronounced than we originally expected and likely due to a combination of rents reaching such a high peak, along with less pricing power than expected as we ended the year. Given current uncertainty about the economy, including increasing layoff announcements, this moderation isn\u2019t surprising, though the January employment report that Mark just mentioned was very encouraging. Sitting here today, we have good occupancy with solid demand across our markets. Our dashboards and current leasing momentum continue to signal a normal spring. Let me take a minute and walk through the building blocks of our guidance range of 4.5% to 6% revenue growth. This is an updated look to what we provided in our third quarter management presentation. So first, we start with an embedded growth of 4.2% for 2023. This is slightly below the midpoint of the range we talked about in the third quarter of 4% to 5%, but mostly consistent with expectations and takes into account the additional concessions used in the fourth quarter. Next, we expect strong occupancy for 2023 at 96.2% which includes a continuation of low resident turnover but is 20 basis points lower than that of 2022. Finally, we\u2019re assuming blended rates in 2023 will average approximately 4% for the full year. This assumption incorporates capturing our 1.5% loss to lease along with approximately 2.5% intraperiod growth in rates. This intraperiod growth assumes a positive impact from less overall pressure from competitive new supply and acknowledges some potential headwinds for a softening economy. For your reference, in a normal non-recessionary year, we would expect intraperiod growth to be about 3% to 3.5% with us capturing about half of that gain in same-store revenue. The first half of 2023 will benefit from the momentum we had last year, while the back half of the year faces tougher comps and could feel the impact of the economy, as the year progresses. The contribution of this blended rate growth to revenue will be approximately half, as we capture it over the 2023 leasing season. Add all of that up and the implication is revenue growth over 6%, which would be exceptional after a remarkable 2022. The midpoint of our guidance range however is 5.25%, which is lower because we do not expect bad debt net to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2023, and it continues to work against us this year, due to a lack of expected government rental assistance and the extension of the eviction moratoriums in both LA and Alameda counties. Bob will go into more detail on bad debt net, including our assumption in his prepared remarks. The outlook I just described is based on a belief that, while the economy may be slowing, our business continues to demonstrate a number of favorable drivers and resiliency. As we have often said in the past, we focus on our dashboards while also acknowledging the headlines. While keeping in mind that this is very early in the year, when we look at our dashboards today, the portfolio is demonstrating sequential improvement in both pricing trends and application volume, as we would expect, which by all indications is a typical pre-pandemic setup for the spring leasing season. New York and Boston will be two of our top performers in 2023, after delivering strong results in 2022. In San Francisco and Seattle, we are seeing good demand and sequential improvement in pricing with slight reductions in both the quantity and value of concessions being offered since the beginning of the year. Even with this modest improvement, the overall level of concessions are still elevated, resulting in weaker-than-anticipated pricing power. San Francisco and Seattle have been slower to recover than the other markets, but both posted really good revenue growth in 2022. Both cities have been balancing a combination of quality of life issues in their downtown, which are getting better and a delayed return to the office from large tech employers. In addition, there have been some layoff announcements from companies based in these two cities. These layoffs are a direct result of excessive hiring during the pandemic. This excess was spread across multiple markets and countries, not just Seattle and San Francisco. The remote nature of work in tech during the pandemic along with these hiring sprees, likely means that the layoffs are more geographically dispersed than in prior periods. Both of these cities remain hubs of the tech industry and share an entrepreneurial spirit that will continue to incubate the next big idea, be it AI or other innovations we find changing our lives a decade from now. The midpoint of our guidance range assumes that these markets continue to improve modestly as we get into the spring leasing season but overall weakness persists, which is why our intraperiod growth assumptions for the company overall are somewhat lower than the typical 3% to 3.5% range. If San Francisco and Seattle get some traction this year, that could have a significant positive impact on our same-store revenue growth as could a more rapid improvement in bad debt net, leading us to the higher end of our range. Reaching the bottom end of our range would require either rate growth to slow much earlier in the year than expected or occupancy to dip to the mid-95% range for a sustained period of time. And lastly, before I turn it over to Bob to discuss our guidance, I want to spend a minute on our focus on innovation. On the revenue side, we will continue to focus on other income items like Wi-Fi, parking and amenity rate optimization. We will also leverage data and analytics to create opportunities to expand our operating margin. We have been a sector leader in limiting same store expense growth, and this is attributable to our team\u2019s willingness to embrace innovation and initiatives focused on centralized activities. We are driven to get the most out of the portfolio and continue to have great success in creating efficiencies in our sales and office functions. In 2023, we will complete the centralization of onsite activities such as application processing, and our move-out and collection process. On the service side, we will continue to leverage our mobile platform to create more opportunities to share our resources across multiple properties. I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to the residents and focus on delivering these terrific operating results. With that I will turn the call over to Bob. Bob Garechana : Thanks, Michael. Let me start with bad debt, which should round out our thought process on same-store revenue guidance, followed up with a little commentary on same-store expenses, normalized FFO and the balance sheet. As Michael mentioned, the midpoint of our same-store revenue guidance assumes a 90 basis-point reduction in revenue growth due to the impact of bad debt. As we mentioned during last quarter\u2019s call, the biggest driver of this drag is the lack of rental relief payments in 2023 relative to 2022. Specifically, we received a little over $32 million in rent relief in 2022 that isn\u2019t in the numbers in 2023. And while we ended last year with more residents paying their rent than when we started the year, a trend that we would expect to continue, our forecast doesn\u2019t assume this will be significant enough to offset this lack of rental assistance. Unfortunately, recent delays in lifting eviction moratoriums and slow processing within the courts led us to this more cautious forecast that reflects a more modest improvement coming later in the year than we had initially hoped for. We\u2019re hopeful that this caution might be unwarranted, in which case we could achieve the top end of our guidance range. But for now, we still expect delinquency to return to pre-pandemic levels, but more likely in 2024 than in 2023. Turning to expenses, I\u2019m proud to report that in 2022, we once again continued to execute on our strategy of using technology and centralization to reduce exposure to labor pressures. Same-store payroll expense growth was negative for the second year in a row, and even when combining payroll with repairs and maintenance, a line item with significant labor exposure and product inflation, growth was below 3% for the second year in a row again. Combine that with low real estate taxes and we were able to deliver industry low expense growth. For 2023, the midpoint of our same-store expense guidance is 4.5%. This forecasted growth rate is about 100 basis points higher than what I just described for 2022 but well below both inflation and our revenue guidance, meaning we expect 2023 to be another year of operating margin expansion for the Company. Of the four major categories of expenses, repairs and maintenance and utilities should grow at a pace slower than 2022, while real estate taxes and payroll should be faster. These latter two categories face challenging comparable periods given 2022\u2019s remarkable performance in addition to the following drivers : For real estate taxes, we expect municipalities will recognize the great strong income performance for multifamily in 2022 and as a result take a more aggressive approach to assess values and rates. Total tax growth should be around 4%, up from 1% in 2022 with California continuing to benefit from Prop 13 at the low end of growth and expansion markets like Colorado, Texas and Georgia towards the higher end. These expansion markets are a small part of our same-store portfolio and the expected growth is consistent with what we underwrote on acquisition. For payroll, we expect 2023 growth to be around 3.5%, up from the decline of 2% that I just mentioned in 2022 and still well below typical wage inflation. We believe we can achieve this target through our continued discipline around staffing and optimization of our workflow. Turning to normalized FFO, page 2 of the release provides a detailed reconciliation of our forecasted contributors to NFFO growth. Our midpoint of $3.75 per share includes a $0.01 of forecasted casualty losses from the California rainstorms that we mentioned in the release, and results in over 6% year-over-year NFFO growth, a very solid year for the Company. Finally, some comments on our planned financing activity for 2023 and the balance sheet. We mentioned in the past that we have an $800 million secured debt pool coming due, most of which needs to be refinanced in the secured market later this year. The current rate on the pool is 4.21% and the maturity is in November. The pool is very financeable, given it is roughly 50% levered and covers debt service nearly 2 times. We have favorably hedged more than half the treasury risk on the financing and would expect to be able to refinance later in the year at a 5% rate or better, which is also incorporated in our guidance. After that, the Company has no maturities to speak of until June of 2025. We have low floating rate exposure, the lowest leverage in our history, significant debt capacity and ample liquidity supported by our recently recast revolver that will support our future capital allocation activities. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi. Nick Joseph : Thank you. You talked about the innovation impact and the benefits to potential margin expansion. Can you quantify the impact of those programs, both on same-store revenue and expenses in 2023? Michael Manelis : Yes. Hey Nick, this is Michael. So first, I guess, I would say back in the November management presentation, we highlighted this whole technology evolution of our platform. That really has been focused on creating this mobility and efficiency in the operating model. And clearly, for the last couple of years, it\u2019s been more expense-focused and that shows up in the numbers that we just talked about. Specific to 2023, I think we\u2019ve included just over $10 million in the guidance with still about two-thirds of that benefit on the expense front, and that\u2019s spread out across a couple of various accounts in repair and maintenance, along with the payroll accounts. And the revenue impact is several million dollars in \u201823. But for us, it\u2019s probably going to kick in more in the back half of the year and really start to show up in 2024 as a lot of these initiatives we have don\u2019t get put into place until kind of the middle of the year. We got a lot of different pilots going on right now with like short-term and common area rentals, the property wide Wi-Fi. We\u2019ve got another 25,000 units being installed with the smart home. And again, most of this is going to contribute probably to the other income line. And I think you see about 20 or 30 basis-point growth in that number for 2023. And I\u2019ll tell you, we\u2019re excited about all of this stuff. We\u2019re going to continue to kind of look at the way we\u2019ve been doing this in the past, which is areas that are capital intensive. And the technology is like first gen. We\u2019re -- that signals to us that it\u2019s okay to be a fast follower in that area, similar to like how we approach the smart home installations and for us, we just want to make sure that we\u2019re going to get the appropriate return on this stuff. So, I think right now, the foundation is almost in place. By the middle of the year, we\u2019ll have kind of most of the operating platform where we need it to be to capture that benefit. And I think you should expect the $30 million to $35 million that we outlined in that presentation really to start shifting more towards that revenue front in \u201824 and \u201825. But at the end of the day, the reality is you\u2019re never done with this pursuit of operational excellence, and it\u2019s something that\u2019s clearly wired into the DNA of our company. Nick Joseph : Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just maybe on supply, as you see new supply coming on, what\u2019s the concessionary environment today for those lease-ups? And maybe you can touch on concessions on stabilized properties as well in the market, if there are some. And then, what are the expectations for the concessionary environment in \u201823 for that new supply coming on? Michael Manelis : Yes. So again, for us, we\u2019re very focused, right, on this proximity of the supply, when are the first units going to hit the market. And specific to the \u201823 deliveries, it\u2019s pretty clear to us across our portfolio that we\u2019re going to feel less overall direct pressure like from it. What we\u2019ve been watching is in the fourth quarter, which is really a bad time to watch for concession change because you typically see concessions inch up but in many of the markets, you\u2019re seeing that the new supply did absolutely grow their concessions compared to the third quarter and tend to be in that 6- to 8-week range. What\u2019s promising for us right now is that we did see, just like in the stabilized portfolio, starting the year in January, starting to see these concessions kind of fall back a little bit in the volume of the concessions that are being issued as well as the value of them. So for us right now, I\u2019ll tell you that we\u2019re still focused in San Francisco and Seattle is where we see the heaviest concentration of supply of concessions being used. And it\u2019s about 25% of our applications in San Francisco are receiving about two weeks. And then in Seattle, we have about 40% of applications receiving one month. And if you put kind of all of that into the blender and you think about like 2023 and our expectations, right now in our portfolio, we kind of normalize concessions to the 2022 level, so we expect to continue to see some elevated concessions in the shoulder periods. And it\u2019s hard to say what\u2019s going to happen with the new supply across the market. It\u2019s clearly something we\u2019re going to be watching. Bob Garechana : So Nick, just from a financial standpoint, like Michael mentioned, concessions are kind of flat, so no contribution to revenue growth or decline to revenue growth, \u201822 to \u201823. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our next question from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please go ahead, sir. John Pawlowski : Alec, a question for you on the transaction market. I know things are pretty frozen right now. But from the trends you\u2019re seeing in terms of buyer and seller behavior, which one or two of your markets do you think is mispriced right now in the private market, either cheap or expensive? Alec Brackenridge : Hey John, yes, it\u2019s Alec. It\u2019s hard to say that any one is mispriced right now because there\u2019s so little transaction activity. The activity that we have seen is typically, say, 1031 buyer who has to place money or maybe a seller who for whatever reason has to move a property. But that\u2019s been really hard to -- and few and far between. It\u2019s very hard to pick market and say any one of them is more opportunistic than the other. I would say though that looking forward, markets that have a lot of supply coming are -- typically it\u2019s coming from merchant builders who are not capitalized to own the property in the long run. And so, I expect to see some opportunities there, new product coming from merchant builders that really want to move it. And other areas of opportunity are -- I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read about the private REITs that have the redemption requests that they need to fulfill. Not all of that product is a great fit for us, but some of that might be an opportunity. And then, you have the guys who took on floating rate debt that have caps that are expiring. So, it\u2019s been really slow, but I think that there\u2019s going to be more opportunity in the next six to nine months and more capitulation probably coming from sellers than buyers given how the financing market has been pretty choppy. John Pawlowski : Okay. That makes sense. Just a follow-up there. You mentioned the private REITs, merchant builders and then variable rate debt, those kind of sources of potential distress. How would you rank the level of distress or capitulation among those sources right now, 1 to 10, 10 being the worst, 1 being no problems at all? Alec Brackenridge : Well, the merchant builders really just -- it\u2019s just not their game to do that, with rates being high -- I don\u2019t know how to put a number on that, to be honest with you. But I think that there will be some trades there. Obviously, some of the private REITs have found alternate sources of capital. So maybe they\u2019re able to mitigate that a little bit. And clearly, these caps are probably the highest among the three. And because they\u2019re so much higher than they -- I think they\u2019re 8 to 10x what they used to cost. So that clearly is an area that\u2019s going to be very challenging. Mark Parrell : Hey John, it\u2019s Mark. Just to contribute to that, because it\u2019s hard to number order it, like you said, but it\u2019s easy to think about what it costs to wait. So that option a seller has is costly because SOFR, which is now the new index rate is 4.5%. So you figure -- if you have a development loan, you\u2019re 2.5 to 3.5 percentage points above that. So you\u2019re somewhere at 7% to 8%, 8.5%, that\u2019s expensive debt to be sitting around hoping for an improvement. Meantime, the preferential rate on your equity is likely something like 8% as well. So I do think, as Alec said, unlike in the past, that option cost of waiting is more expensive for the seller than it\u2019s typically been. And these caps -- again, a lot of these caps were struck at 4% or 5%, they\u2019re deeply in the money now. So I mean, clearly, the price of a cap that a lender would require you to get is going to be very expensive. So, I think those are significant pressures. The private REITs are out there. We see product. And again, not all of it\u2019s suited to us. They have other levers they can pull as well. But I think you\u2019ll see more from them through the year as well. But we don\u2019t see a panic sale market at all. We just expect people to sort of capitulate and just say it isn\u2019t going all the way back to 3.5 cap rates in the next six months, so we\u2019re going to go and sell at the market price, whether that\u2019s high-4s, low-5s, medium-5s will -- yet to be determined. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Chandni Luthra : Just talking about Seattle and San Francisco a little bit, you guys talked about quality of living as an issue. Are you seeing any dispersion across property types in those markets, downtown versus the rest? And then, are there any signs of slowdown beyond the central business district that you\u2019re seeing in your numbers, in your databases at the moment? Michael Manelis : Yes. Hi Chandni, this is Michael. So, I think in both of those areas, clearly, you saw more of the concession use in the fourth quarter concentrated into those urban cores of those markets. The demand is there across urban, suburban across all of the submarkets. It just got a little bit more price sensitivity to it. And clearly, I think the urban still has more pronounced price sensitivity than the suburban areas. And we haven\u2019t really seen any change. Like in the demand profile coming in, we haven\u2019t seen any shifts like going urban or suburban in those markets, the profile seems very similar to what we are typically used to kind of seeing in the market. And right now, I guess I would tell you, when we look at these January stats and we think about the sequential improvement that we\u2019re seeing over kind of the December numbers, those urban markets are actually kind of growing at a pace a little bit faster than the suburban and probably because we\u2019re pulling back on the concession, right? So, when we think about that, you can see you pull back a couple of weeks on a concession, that\u2019s like a 4% change in pricing right off the bat. So, no real signals yet to any significant change other than what we have felt, which is the urban cores, which by the way, do feel better from a quality of life. You could see the efforts that are being placed in both of these cities right now on it. You can feel the improvement there. But you still just have more pronounced price sensitivity in those urban areas. Chandni Luthra : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And this one for my follow-up, I\u2019m not sure if you guys look at it that way. I know you guys do a lot of bottom-up stuff. But as you think about different markets, what\u2019s your overall job growth assumption? And then, what\u2019s your sort of top market versus bottom market as you think about job growth forecast in there, how much delta are we looking at? Are you still in positive territory on the West Coast? Any color there would be appreciated. And I completely understand if that is not something that you guys look at that level of detail. Mark Parrell : Yes. Hey Chandni, it\u2019s Mark. We don\u2019t look at job forecast -- national job forecast, especially as particularly relevant to our numbers. We do focus a little more on the bottom up. We do spend time and we\u2019ve done the regression analysis and a lot of the work to try and understand how different variables, job growth, like foremost and household income among them, impact our numbers in the near term. And so we do kind of gut check what comes out of the bottom-up process with our perspective from the top down, both in terms of numbers that your firm and others put out there as potential forecast. But we don\u2019t have a model that we would rely on that would spit out numbers. I think there\u2019s just too many variables. We back tested lots of those models. And I\u2019ll tell you, we don\u2019t have confidence than that system being a better one than looking at it from the bottom up, feeling your market, understanding local drivers of employment, local supply and sort of thinking about your business that way, has proven to us to be much more reliable. So, we feel really good, though, about job growth in our markets generally. I mean, the employment report last week was terrific. Our residents, as I said in my remarks, they found work when they\u2019ve lost their positions. And it\u2019s been a very small number of people, literally handfuls that have handed us their keys. So, this is -- if this is a recession, it\u2019s the best one we\u2019ve ever been to. And it\u2019s going pretty well for us so far. So, I don\u2019t have anything to share with you in terms of top-down job forecast inputs. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Steve Sakwa : Mark, to stay on that question and your comments about sort of getting the keys back. Is it concentrated in any one market and are there other discussions where maybe people haven\u2019t given you the keys back, but there\u2019s conversations with managers and people are a bit more on edge about finding kind of work in the tech markets? Or just how would you handicap that? Michael Manelis : Yes. So Steve, this is Michael. So I guess, I would say that we started this back in kind of the end of the third quarter or early fourth quarter, just really kind of tracking that like going deeper on reasons for move out, if people said job change, to understand it. And we are talking like less than a dozen. And when you say concentrated, I mean, it\u2019s such a small number, but it really is spread only in the Seattle and San Francisco market. And I think the teams, if you went across the country would say we always have one or two that come in and say that they lost their job and they\u2019re leaving, and that\u2019s why. So we really haven\u2019t seen anything. And clearly, there\u2019s some conversations when you get into the renewals with some folks that they tell us that they\u2019re changing jobs or that they lost their job. But in the concentrations of Seattle and San Francisco, it doesn\u2019t feel like they\u2019re overly concerned that they\u2019re not going to be gainfully employed, quickly. Mark Parrell : And Steve, it\u2019s Mark. Just to supplement on that just a bit. Our transfers are low, too. So sometimes you\u2019ll see people going down to a cheaper unit and things like that that can also be an indicator of stress. We don\u2019t see that in any meaningful size. And we did a little research, I want to share. We asked our folks in markets like San Francisco, Seattle, New York. When a local firm announces a layoff, then tracking that either using the filings, and I believe you do something similar, using the various governmental filings or some of the layoffs, dot, whatever websites and what we\u2019re seeing is just like these tech jobs and a lot of these financial jobs were spread over the whole country of late, these layoffs are spread over the whole country. So generally, we\u2019ve seen a Bay Area company or a Seattle company announced layoffs, 20% to 30% of those are in that home market and the rest are spread all over the country. So I think what you and I, right, recall from \u201801 where if you had a tech layoff in San Francisco, that person was definitively in San Francisco, I think it\u2019s much more diffused now, and it\u2019s just a different sort of employment picture than it was in the past. Steve Sakwa : Great. Thanks for that color. And then, maybe just circling back on the transaction market for either you or for Alec. How have you guys changed your underwriting, whether it\u2019d be IRRs or kind of growth? And kind of where do you think the market is today for both acquisitions and for you guys to start any new development projects? Alec Brackenridge : Hey Steve, this is Alec. Yes. So, our cost of debt is somewhere around 5%. We would expect a cap rate to be close to that or above that. Longer-term, we\u2019d look at an unleveraged IRR of about 8%. And that\u2019s really hard to find in today\u2019s market. There are a few opportunities here and there, but largely, sellers are still hanging on to a 4.5% to 4.75%, which is just hard to make the numbers work. And as I said before, I think there might be a little movement on that end. Harder still is the development yield. And if you\u2019re thinking that stabilized properties are pricing at around of 5, then development really should be around 6, and it\u2019s hard to get to that number with costs continuing to escalate, not as fast as they had been,, whereas they used to be escalating at say, 1% a month, now probably closer to 0.5% a month, but they\u2019re still going up and getting from a 5 to 6 is a pretty heavy lift. And most deals prior to the rate hikes were price -- development deals pricing out to about 5% to 5.25%, and that was a nice spread when cap rates were below 4%. Obviously, that\u2019s not the case anymore. So getting to a 6% is a heavy lift. And there\u2019s just so much that can come out of the price of the land because land is typically, say, 10% to 15% of the entire deal. So it\u2019s a heavy lift to get to there. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. John Kim : On the subject of bad debt, given the resident relief funds are likely not going to be there as much this year. Can you just clarify what your bad debt was in 2022 on a gross basis versus where you think it is going to be this year? We calculate it at 2.3 going to 1.9, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s other factors in there. So I just wanted to clarify that with you. Bob Garechana : Hey John, it\u2019s Bob. No, your math is actually pretty accurate. So page 13 kind of gives you a perspective. We were 1% net. When you add back the $32 million that is -- and the math that you probably did to the bad debt, that does work out to, I would have said, 2.25% as a percentage of revenue. And then when you move forward based on the drag on same store, we get to like around 1.90, a little bit closer to 1.85 as a percentage of revenue on that. So you guys have got it triangulated correctly. John Kim : Minor miracle. So, where do you see it going in \u201824? Are you saying it\u2019s normalizing, where does it go back to normal levels? Can you remind us what that is? Bob Garechana : Yes. So, normal would have been around 50 basis points, would have been kind of typical. And we still do think that that is given the quality of our resident base, et cetera, that that is the likely long-term outcome. And as I mentioned in my remarks, just to be fair, too, it is very difficult to forecast kind of the projection of how fast this improvement that we have seen even outside of rental relief will come. We\u2019re hopeful that it\u2019s faster than what we put in the numbers, and that could get us there quicker and closer to that 50 basis points faster than what are in the numbers, but you\u2019re correct as to as to -- it is not only a minor miracle, but it is great when math works. So your math works perfectly in that specific numbers. John Kim : Just one quick follow-up. You said on the $800 million debt maturity this year that it needs to be refinanced in secured market. Can you just clarify on that comment? Is that because the pricing is better, or are there other factors? Bob Garechana : No, it\u2019s structural. It\u2019s a structural kind of tax protection component. It\u2019s a piece of debt that actually was financed related to the Archstone acquisition. So, there are certain partners that were in the old Archstone structure that had tax protection. So, we have obligations to maintain some secured debt, a portion of that in secured, and that\u2019s why. As you think about the -- so it has nothing to do with kind of anything about that structural piece. When you do look at kind of the secured debt markets relative to the unsecured, the unsecured has come in a little bit. So, it\u2019s slightly more favorable than the secured, but they\u2019re all pricing in that, call it, high-4s range, especially for really low levered product in the secured like we had -- like we have in this pool. So it\u2019s not a market decision choice. It\u2019s more of a structural choice. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Adam Kramer : Hey guys. Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate it. Look, I just wanted to ask a little bit about kind of the January commentary. Maybe it\u2019s the seasonality commentary in the release. Look, Mike, I think you kind of -- you mentioned, right, maybe a little bit worse than seasonal in the fourth quarter. But at the same time, right, I think January, new lease I mean is strongest among the group, still kind of positive 140 basis points. So, maybe just kind of trying to tie or square these different things together, right, the occupancy loss, strong new lease and kind of the seasonality comments and try to kind of tie or blend all those things together in terms of kind of what\u2019s happening right now with fundamentals. Michael Manelis : Yes. Hey Adam, it\u2019s Michael. So, I think what I would look to is one, the sequential comment I was referring to is December to January, not like when you\u2019re looking into the release, the fourth quarter to January numbers. So, when you think about occupancy, our occupancy actually held flat, right? We were, I think, 95.8% in December; we\u2019re 95.8% or 95.9% for January. And so, I look at that and say, as you think about returning to normal seasonality, it is very common for occupancy to trade down into that fourth quarter. So what we saw is that pattern kind of emerge. And outside of some of the pricing pressure that I described, some of the additional concessions, the way that the rents moderated is very consistent with what you would expect. That being said, you turn the corner and you get into January, what we normally would see in January is right after that new year, you see sequential improvement every week in application volume and rents ticking up and we got a little bit of an accelerant, like I said, in the urban because we started pulling back concessions when we saw that inbound demand doing what you would expect it to do. Now, what\u2019s interesting is like the cold weather climates like Boston and New York, they kind of tend to stall in February. You get a little bit of a boost in Jan and then it stalls and then you hit March and then you\u2019re kind of off to the races for the spring leasing season. So, I think my commentary was just pointing to you if I went back and looked at \u201818, \u201819, any of these years, the trends that we\u2019re seeing today, and again, we\u2019re five weeks into the year or something like that is very consistent with a normal year, which would tell us you would expect a normal spring leasing season. Adam Kramer : Great. That\u2019s super helpful. Thanks for all that color, Michael. Just maybe switching gears a little bit to development. If I\u2019m not mistaken, I don\u2019t think it was mentioned much in kind of the opening comments. I know it\u2019s -- obviously not kind of your biggest part of your business, but you probably do a little bit more development than some of your peers. I\u2019m just wondering kind of what the thoughts are there? Are there going to be starts in \u201823 or is that kind of more on the back burner now kind of given some of the uncertainties in the environment? Mark Parrell : Yes. Thanks for that question, Adam. We have a terrific development team, both the in-house team that started and built $400 million towers as well as much smaller projects. And then we\u2019ve got the JV with Toll and others. So, we think development is a nice complement to our acquisitions, particularly in these expansion markets. The instruction that Alec and I have sort of given both our outside partners as well as our internal teams is find things that you can work on for the next few months that we can start late this year and sometime next. Maybe the capital will be a little more reasonable, maybe the underwriting will be a little bit better, maybe the cost structure will make a little more sense. And so, let\u2019s be thoughtful about starting a lot right now where you really feel like your opportunity is likely to be in the acquisition market. But we\u2019d love to tactically start. We\u2019ve got a few things already in the sort of inventory we\u2019d like to do, but it\u2019s just got to make sense. I mean, we\u2019re just not going to plow ahead and put our shareholders\u2019 money into a development deal if acquisition is a cheaper alternative or if just the costs and the risks involved are too significant. So to answer your question about development, it\u2019s very important to us. We don\u2019t have any starts really in the budget for this year. But just like acquisitions, we don\u2019t have any of those either. But we\u2019re happy to do plenty of them. Bob commented on the balance sheet strength. I think the debt markets would support a big EQR issuance to fund either of those, if we thought that was a good idea. So, we\u2019ll just keep watching it closely. And if there\u2019s something that comes there on the development side, like I said, we got the internal team, we got the Toll folks, we\u2019ve got others. I mean we can put that into gear. But we\u2019re happy to have it at zero, too, if that\u2019s the right decision for the shareholders. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Haendel St. Juste: Hey. I just want to follow up on that last question a bit first. So understanding that this early season pickup maybe in line with the historical trends as you mentioned. I guess, I\u2019m more curious on your comments about expectations for normal spring leasing season and what that would imply near term for new lease rates. So maybe can you give some more color on how that normal trend has played out historically, what that could mean for new lease rates here into the spring season? Thanks. Michael Manelis : Yes. Hey. This is Michael. So I think the way to think about the modeling of what a normal curve would look like is what we will see right now is new lease change will start to sequentially grow and typically will max out somewhere in that third quarter and then will seasonally moderate as you get to the year. For our assumption of this blended rate of 4, we basically are assuming about 2 -- a little over like 2.25% in new lease change across the whole year but it is -- it\u2019s kind of like a bell curve. We\u2019re going to work our way through the spring and keep building it and then we\u2019re going to let it moderate. When you think about renewals right now, on capturing some of the loss to lease, we have some pretty good numbers at a 6.9% achieved renewal increase in January. Our expectation, and I\u2019ve got these quotes out for the next 90 days, we\u2019re going to stay somewhere in this 5% to 6% range in this first half of the year. And then I would expect that number to moderate like it would normally do into like a 4% to 5% range in the back half of the year. So, on a full like likely guidance model that puts renewals somewhere just north of 5% and when you put those two together and you think about the retention factor, it winds up getting you to that blended rate of about 4%. Haendel St. Juste: That\u2019s really helpful. I appreciate that color. Maybe some color on your expectations between some of the stronger East Coast markets, New York, Boston, D.C., in contrast to some of the weaker West Coast, San Francisco, Seattle, curious how the spread between those two -- or what do you thinking you\u2019re expecting for the spread between those two regions this year? Thanks. Michael Manelis : Yes. Well, maybe I\u2019ll just kind of bucket the markets around. So I think I said in the prepared remarks, I mean, New York, we expect it to be our best performing market followed very closely by Boston and then really close by San Diego and Orange County as well. I\u2019m going to put aside L.A. and San Francisco for a moment because of the bad debt implications. But if you really looked at all of our other markets, you could almost bucket them in this 4.5% to 5% kind of revenue growth range for 2023. And then you get into the San Francisco and L.A. that has the bad debt impact. Without it, both of those markets would be in this 4.5% to 5% range as well. But with it, San Francisco, right now, we\u2019re forecasting around just under a 3.5% growth and L.A. is just north of a 1.5% growth. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jeff Spector : Just wanted to talk a little bit more, Mark, about your comments, and I totally understand the uncertainty on the macro, our econ team has once again pushed out its recession forecast for the second half of \u201823. So, I guess, just thinking about macro versus what your revenue management systems are telling you as the weeks go by, how will you be operating through the start of peak leasing into peak leasing and if things do look like -- again, if it looks like it\u2019s going to shift to the second half, how does that make a difference to how you\u2019re approaching the peak leasing? Mark Parrell : Hey Jeff, it\u2019s Mark. I\u2019m going to start. I\u2019m going to turn it over to Michael. I mean, we\u2019re lucky to have a very experienced team here and -- both here in Chicago and then across the country, and a great system for feeling the markets. So, when we start seeing a market improve, when we start seeing a market deteriorate, we can react -- or frankly, a submarket or an asset, we react in real time. We don\u2019t wait for macroeconomic data. So, we\u2019re certainly aware of what\u2019s going on. We watch all those employment reports keenly. But I think we\u2019re ahead of that. I think we feel that in our leasing in advance. Because again, if someone lost the job and they immediately got a new one, the government\u2019s data may take some time to show that. The unemployment reports have been really good. So I guess I would say, as we go through the year, we\u2019re going to depend on Michael and his team, and he can elaborate on that in a minute. I have a great revenue management process, great communication on site to sort of see what\u2019s going on in real time and adjust in real time. Michael Manelis : Yes. And I think, Jeff, the only thing I would add to that is clearly, you\u2019re going to try to maximize rate and you\u2019re going to see whether or not you\u2019re getting that corresponding closing rate or the application volume that you need based on how many units you have to sell. And that\u2019s typically what we\u2019re looking at week in, week out, which is that ratio, and then we\u2019re making decisions whether or not we\u2019re leaning in on rate or kind of letting the rates soften a little bit and kind of position ourselves differently. But, on top of just that feel that you have, we\u2019re watching these demographic changes, the income ratios, I think Mark alluded to before, we\u2019re hyper focused on transfer activity, are they moving up in size, down in size, what are they doing, roommate activity. And then, of course, we\u2019re watching that new supply in these markets. And that concession volume that they\u2019re issuing is a signal to us whether or not they\u2019re getting the velocity they need because that absorption rate of that supply is going to tell us whether we\u2019re going to feel more or less pressure from it. Mark Parrell : Yes. Just to add one last thought. It\u2019s Mark again. I mean, we do think about overarching themes. I mean, Michael has been running the business ever since the economy started to feel a little shakier, with a focus on occupancy and retention. He\u2019s opened up some of his renewal ranges. So, we do -- macroeconomics and what we feel in the general U.S. economy does inform some of these leans but we\u2019re quick to learn from what\u2019s going on on-site, and that\u2019s more important to us than any set of numbers coming from anywhere else. So I\u2019ll also tell you in places like New York and Boston, we feel so good about the supply picture and heretofore the jobs picture that those markets are places where our lean will be more aggressive than a place where we might have more anxiety like downtown San Francisco or downtown Seattle. So, we do inform some of those decisions, Jeff, with the big picture. But again, we like to watch what\u2019s going on property by property. Jeff Spector : Thank you. That\u2019s really helpful. So I guess, just to confirm then, as we think about the guidance and the upper half of the range, if this recession is pushed out to the second half, is that kind of the upper end of the guidance range scenario? Mark Parrell : Again, where\u2019s the recession and what part of the economy? And I guess, I\u2019d say if we get through the bulk of the leasing season into July and August and the job numbers are still pretty good and unemployment claims are still pretty low, then I\u2019m very much of the mindset that we\u2019ll have a really good year. If you start to feel those numbers roll over in March, then the year for us and everybody else in the apartment industry is going to feel a little different. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Nick Yulico : Thanks. First question, maybe for you, Mark, is how you guys are thinking about potential for stock buybacks? I mean, you\u2019re not -- not as much acquisitions planned now, harder to pencil as you\u2019ve talked about, you do have a fair amount of free cash flow after the dividend. So, -- low leverage balance sheet. So I\u2019m just trying to understand at some point the stock buybacks become compelling? Do you need asset sales to fund that, or did the balance sheet already set up in a way to handle stock buybacks? Mark Parrell : Yes. Thanks for that question, Nick. I mean, we\u2019ve had versions of this conversation before. The unique thing about a stock buyback versus some of the other investments we make is it has both a capital allocation and a capital structure impact. I mean, we don\u2019t retain a whole heck of a lot of cash flow after CapEx because we\u2019re a REIT, and we have to distribute all our income. So, we look at it, it\u2019s either incurring a whole -- I mean to make a meaningful impact on a company our size, you have to incur a meaningful amount of debt and go out there. And we can do that. We\u2019ve got space for that right now. But you can only do that one time before you\u2019ve affected your ratings, you\u2019ve affected your multiple. We all learned in business school, riskier businesses with more debt, have less multiples, lower multiples. So, the debt side is possible, but it has offsets and is risk. And I also tell you on your asset sales, I mean, Alec and his team have bought well over the years. We\u2019ve done a lot of 1031s. So, there\u2019s a lot of embedded gains. You might sell an asset for $100 million and have $75 million, $80 million of gain to deal with. And so, not a lot of cash flow there either after needed distributions. So, I\u2019ll tell you, Nick, when we see our stock price when it\u2019s trading at such a material discount to NAV like it is now as, is a signal not to use the equity markets to fund growth. That\u2019s what we see it as. And that\u2019s very clear to us. But we do talk to the Board about buybacks periodically, and it\u2019s not like sort of categorically off the table. But again, it\u2019s more of a financial maneuver. And if you don\u2019t do it in size, it\u2019s not terribly meaningful. And the last comment is I\u2019ve watched a lot of REITs buy back meaningful amounts of stock usually away from our sector. And it hasn\u2019t proven to have turned out all that well. I think it\u2019s better used as an indicator of when not to issue equity than it is to go whole hog on some giant share buyback. Nick Yulico : Okay. I appreciate your thoughts there, Mark. Second question is just, I think -- if I think about multifamily, your company, the whole sector right now, I think there\u2019s, at some point, this worry that it\u2019s not so much a 2023 issue relative to guidance. But at some point, if we have a recession over the next year or so, there\u2019s going to be an impact, right? And it\u2019s going to impact the rents and occupancy and revenue. And so, what I\u2019m trying to figure out is, last two recessions were very unusual in terms of the impacts we had to multifamily. How are you guys thinking about -- is there any way -- this is a tough question, but is there any way to think about a downside impact to your company in what is a maybe more normalized recession and sort of an order of magnitude of -- or how much rents could correct or how much revenue or NOI could correct? Mark Parrell : Yes. I guess I\u2019d just make a few comments on that. Obviously, my crystal ball is as blurry as yours. I mean, a lot of these other recent recessions, there were huge excesses in the economy or like the pandemic, just a panic, as you mentioned, that just made the whole thing very unusual. I don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re terribly out of whack. So, it feels to me like any recession that occurs, it will be more like a slowdown in jobs as opposed to some, we are putting out negative 400,000 jobs a month type numbers. So I feel like if 2024 comes around, the business will perform relatively well and certainly better than the last downturn or so. I also think you got to compare it to what else is going on in the economy. We\u2019ve typically been a pretty good inflation hedge. We put materials in our book about that. So, if you think you\u2019re going to have a slowdown in the economy, and you\u2019re going to continue to have some inflation, I mean typically, our business has been able to raise rents in excess of the inflation rate in our kind of business. And Michael and his team do a great job of managing expenses. So, I look at it and I think in a slow growth economy, maybe with a little bit of inflation, I think we can still do on a relative basis really well at our company because, again, we manage expenses well. I think the next recession, if there is one late this year or next is I do agree likely to be less about excesses and dramatic type downturns and a little more gradual. And I think our numbers will reflect that. But boy, it\u2019s really hard to predict, and nobody knows for sure, right? Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Alexander Goldfarb : Mark, definitely seems like between the bookies making bets on the Super Bowl, we could have the same bet here on whether or not this recession has been affected summer leasing. So certainly a topic we\u2019re all watching. Two questions here. The first question is a lot of regulatory focus recently, the White House, obviously, on fee income, President mentioned it as far as hotels go in the State of the Union. But more importantly, apartments are under a lot of regulations already. So, as you guys think about your fee income that you charge, your new lease fees, the pet fees and all that stuff, as you guys look through all that, do you feel comfortable with where you are? And you\u2019re like, look, we already abide by all the regulations, all the stuff is covered, or is there a concern that the regulators could push harder on some of these line items? Mark Parrell : Well, I\u2019m going to split that question up. If you\u2019re asking whether we think we comply with the law right now, we think we do. We\u2019ve done extensive reviews on that because we feel like you do, there\u2019s more regulatory sensitivity. A lot of these rules, by the way, are very complex or very judgmental. They may say you can\u2019t charge unfair fees and things like that that are harder for us to peg. But the legal team has worked really hard with operations to make sure what we\u2019re doing right now makes a ton of sense. Either Michael or Bob could talk about what percent of total revenues are the kinds of fees you\u2019re talking about. I think it\u2019s 3% in that neighborhood. So it\u2019s meaningful, and it can grow faster than the remainder of the portfolio. But if we had to moderate it, we\u2019ll deal with it. But again, things like pet fees, I mean, pets create real cost to the property. I mean the cleaning costs are much higher. So in some cases, these are profit and in some cases, these are just additional costs that will come into the system one way or another. So on the regulatory front, we\u2019re just going to have good conversations with all these regulators about all this stuff. A lot of this is not thoughtful and it\u2019s going to discourage capital going into residential and isn\u2019t going to help with the shortage of affordable housing. So, we\u2019re going to push that line more and more and keep having that kind of conversation. But on the fee side, it\u2019s really that material to us, it\u2019s just not a good idea. It\u2019s another one of those sort of why shouldn\u2019t the cost of someone\u2019s pet be borne by the pet owner as opposed to borne by the entire complex, for example. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. No, makes sense. And then second question is, the recent L.A. good cause eviction, one of the items, if I read it correctly, was that basically a tenant cannot pay a month and be fine and not be deemed to be in arrears or anything. Is this the correct understanding? And if so, is that -- does that mean that in L.A. county and hopefully -- not hopefully, and unfortunately, if other markets adopt this, that bad debt could now seem to be the sort of elevated thing versus historic? Or is there a way for landlords to make sure that someone just isn\u2019t getting a free month for no reason other than they can get a free month? Mark Parrell : Yes. Thanks for that question. I don\u2019t have that right in front of me. I did read the sort of general idea that there is a permissible amount of default -- defaulted debt that a resident could have. But again, our rents on average approach $3,000, in that market a little bit lower, but they\u2019re significant. So if it was a dollar limit -- gosh, I thought, Alex, it was a dollar limit, not a month\u2019s rent limit, but I\u2019d have to look into that, we\u2019d have to have another conversation. But I think the theme here is the more you regulate things like this, the less capital that will go into the industry, to renovate properties or to create more housing. And it\u2019s just a bad idea, and we\u2019ve got a really good team that\u2019s pushing this. And people hear us. When you talked about the administration, I mean, the Biden administration\u2019s Build Back Better Act had some terrific stuff about zoning flexibility and encouraging at localities. The Governor of California and the Governor of New York have been pushing supply and more units being built and trying to work with the industry, both on the for sale and rental side. So I think there are people listening to us. It\u2019s just we got to keep it up because a lot of the ideas you mentioned are just not constructive. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Sam Cho [ph] with Credit Suisse. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys. I\u2019m on for Tayo today. Thank you for keeping the cal going. So, I know -- I think it was one of my former colleagues that asked about, I guess, the supply pressure. But can you remind us how you guys go about judging the threat from new competition and how that kind of -- and how that factors into portfolio exposure? Because just from our end, it\u2019s really hard to see that. So kind of understanding your qualitative or quantitative metrics to frame out how you guys judge that threat factor would be interesting to hear from our standpoint. Alec Brackenridge : Hey Sam, it\u2019s Alec. And yes, we do spend a lot of time looking at supply, and as Michael mentioned earlier, focusing on the proximity of the supply to our properties. And we find that\u2019s where we\u2019ve really gotten the pressure on our ability to grow rents. And it depends where we are. In Manhattan, proximate supply is a lot tighter than, say, in California. So we adjust for that. And what we\u2019ve seen going from -- and again, this is our property and proximity -- our portfolio and proximity to our properties is in 2022, there was supply that was proximate to us like 110,000 units, and it\u2019s going down quite a bit from there. And the average in the past was around -- I\u2019m sorry, 86,000 units are going down quite a bit from there. So we\u2019re seeing a lot less immediate supply, and the way we measure it has more to do with that proximity than that market level as a whole. Michael Manelis : Yes. I think the one thing I\u2019d add -- this is Michael. I could just add one thing. In like markets like D.C., we have found that because there\u2019s such good transit, like that mile radius doesn\u2019t hold as well. So we would say that we\u2019re going to cast a much wider net and assume that people will move between markets, between some markets just because of that transit. So, every market has like a rule of thumb that we use, and then we drill in and go deep with the investment officers doing their drive buys and given their input, and then the property management team is weighing in, and we ultimately get to this consensus view. And we\u2019ve been doing this way for a long time, and it seems to really hold true. What we have found like in \u201821 and \u201822 that even with elevated supply right on top of us, if the inbound demand is so strong, it doesn\u2019t matter. So, that\u2019s why that absorption rate matters. Unidentified Analyst : That\u2019s really helpful color. And then, one more for me. You touched on overall concession still being pretty elevated. So, I know all recessions are not created equal. But from a historical context, how have concession strategies looked during spring leasing season during a recession? And whether we can draw any lessons from the past to imply what could happen if things go sour? Thank you. Michael Manelis : Yes. So, this is Michael. That\u2019s -- I don\u2019t know if I have that in front of me to look at what the concession dollars were back across the previous recession periods or by quarter to understand the seasonality of them. I guess, what I would look at is just -- it\u2019s very common to see concessions in the stabilized portfolios in the shoulder period that are used in a very strategic basis to really hold up base rent. And when you see it spread where -- like we\u2019ve seen in some of the urban cores of Seattle and San Francisco, where 60%, 70% of the properties that we compete against are offering some form of concession, that is a signal, right, of something in that market. Now, the good news, like I said, is we\u2019re seeing it dial back. And clearly, we\u2019re seeing demand softening. You wouldn\u2019t feel a dial back in that concession amount. So, how you would frame the spring? Right now, I guess I would tell you, I would expect concessions will continue to dial back, both in volume and dollars. But obviously, if you hit like a pretty significant recession period, maybe they sustain and hold at this level. It\u2019s hard for me to say that. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Ami Probandt from UBS. Please go ahead. Ami Probandt : Thanks. The first round of requirements for compliance with the Local Law 97 in New York City are scheduled to take effect in 2024. Do you have any estimates on the impact for your portfolio? Alec Brackenridge : Hi Ami, it\u2019s Alec. We\u2019ve looked at that, and we don\u2019t have an impact right now. We can reach those thresholds. It gets challenging, as you know, over time and \u201823 is another benchmark year, and we\u2019re working towards that as well. So, so far so good, but it\u2019s certainly to get more owners over time. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mark Parrell for closing statements. Mark Parrell : Well, we\u2019re excited, as you can tell from the call about our 2023 prospects, the Company\u2019s long-term positioning, and we\u2019re looking forward to delivering a really good 2023. So, thank you all for your time today and your interest in Equity Residential. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Martin McKenna. Please go ahead, sir. Martin McKenna : Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's first quarter 2023 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO and Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer. Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer and Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer are here with us as well for the Q&A. Our earnings release is posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.  These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.  Now I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Thank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our first quarter 2023 results. We had a very good quarter to start the year with same-store revenue results exceeding our expectations. And while same-store expense growth was higher than we projected due in large part to California storms, that still left us with first quarter net operating income and normalized FFO better than we expected. In a moment, Mike will take you through our first quarter operating highlights. The strength of our revenue results point to the durable nature of our business in the face of volatile economic conditions.  We continue to see substantial demand from our affluent renter demographic and moderate levels of supply in most of our major markets, with the new news in the quarter being the rapidly improving regulatory conditions in California. Based on these continuing positive business conditions and the good prospects we see for our business going forward, during the first quarter, our board raised our common share dividend by 6% on an annualized basis. Despite headlines and layoffs, demand feels solid.  The unemployment rate, particularly for the college educated, remains very low, which gives us a good feeling about the employability and earnings power of our affluent renter customer. In our portfolio, we are not seeing increases in residents downsizing their units or giving us their keys because of job loss. In terms of competition from homeownership, monthly costs and down payment requirements remain high in our markets, especially relative to rents, making renting a high-quality equity residential apartment a better value. Only 8% of our residents who moved out in the first quarter bought a home, and that's down from 12% in the first quarter of 2022. On the apartment supply side, as we have discussed with you on previous calls, we expect 2023 national apartment new supply to run at record levels. But we generally feel good about the level of direct competition that supply will pose to us, given our market mix and importantly, the location of supply within markets relative to our properties. In our coastal markets where we still have 95% of our NOI, we see very manageable competitive new supply in most markets, with Washington, D.C. being the exception, though D.C. is holding up remarkably well so far. In the Sunbelt markets, including the Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin and Atlanta markets in which we are increasingly investing. And in Denver, we are seeing higher relative supply and more impact. We anticipated this when we acquired our Sunbelt in Denver properties, and these properties are generally tracking consistently with our underwriting.  As we look to expand our portfolio in these markets, we expect that these new deliveries will present buying opportunities for us. Mike will also discuss first quarter same-store expense growth, which was higher than we expected, especially in the repairs and maintenance and other on-site operating expenses lines. We think this growth was inflated for discrete reasons that will pass, and we continue to be comfortable in attaining our full year same-store expense range in part due to lower than previously anticipated real estate tax growth, combined with modest on-site payroll expense growth. We have created at our company a culture and system that uses technology and centralization to improve the customer and employee experience and to contain our payroll costs.  While the transaction markets remain unsettled, we did do a couple of deals to start the year. We sold a small collection of 25-year-old properties that totaled 247 units in Los Angeles for about $135 million in advance of the transfer tax increase. Also after the end of the quarter, we purchased a newly developed property in Atlanta for about $79 million that is currently in lease-up. The property is located directly on a portion of the Atlanta beltline that is being improved and paved. The beltline is a desirable amenity to our demographic and has been a catalyst for economic growth and densification across the area. The property's economics benefit from various tax credits and when fully stabilized next year, we expect to attain a 6.6% acquisition cap rate. Removing the tax benefits, which will burn off over time, we see the stabilized fully taxed acquisition cap rate at 5.7%. We also love our basis in this property, which is at $288,000 per unit, and we see that as a 15% to 20% discount to current replacement costs. Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, is here with us to answer your questions on the transaction market. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael Manelis : Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This morning, I'm going to review key takeaways from our first quarter 2023 operating performance in our markets, along with same-store operating expenses. As Mark mentioned, we produced very good same-store revenue growth of 9.2% in the first quarter. These results were ahead of our expectations, primarily due to continuing improvement in delinquency along with continued healthy fundamentals in the business. Before I get into more details on these topics, I want to emphasize that as we sit here today, the early stages of the leasing season and its setup remains strong. With year-to-date pricing trend improvement just above 3.25%, which is where we would expect it to be at this point in the year and is also consistent with expectations underpinning guidance. During the quarter, we continued to see good demand and strong resident retention that produced low turnover, stable occupancy and solid pricing power.  Despite some recent negative job headlines, our average resident remains in great financial shape. With rent income ratios during the quarter for new residents continuing to hover around 20%. The Resident lease breaks due to job loss and transfer activities to reduce rent, often early indicators of resident economic threats remain below pre-pandemic levels and in line with seasonal expectations. A resilient labor market, along with a large number of young adults choosing the exciting attractive lifestyles our markets provide, along with the convenience and cost benefits of renting continues to result in application volumes that are on par with the same period last year and continue to grow as expected into the leasing season. Couple this with the favorable supply position and lack of single-family home ownership competition that Mark outlined, and we should be positioned for another good year. Results to date support the view we shared on our February earnings call that we expect pricing trends for this year to follow a normal, albeit slightly muted seasonal trajectory. Given the difficult comparison periods for 2022 for the back half of the year, along with the return to normal rent growth patterns, we expect that the first quarter will be our highest reported same-store revenue growth with more moderate but still above historical growth in subsequent quarters. While there may be some uncertainty about the economy, including increasing layoff announcements, as I said previously, we are not seeing this impact our day-to-day operations. While we acknowledge that we are generally a lagging indicator, so far so good as we head to our primary leasing season. Now let me spend a few minutes talking about our market performance. Let's start with the East Coast. New York and D.C. are both exceeding expectations, while Boston is in line. New York was by far the top performer for the first quarter with same-store revenue growth of over 19%. With very limited and isolated supply, the outperformance in this market is consistent across all submarkets. Occupancy is currently 97.5% and all demand indicators continue to flash green, making this market the expected top performer for the year. Turning to D.C. Performance has thus far been a pleasant surprise with the market continuing to absorb significant new supply, while still delivering good revenue growth. Similar to New York, occupancy is strong, and so far, all submarkets remain resilient in the face of new supply. Now for the West Coast, Southern California continues to post good numbers. And most notably, we are starting to see improvement in delinquency, particularly in Los Angeles, which has the heaviest concentration. As the eviction moratorium expired, we are seeing more of our delinquent residents figuring out the best option that works for them, which is either paying rent or moving out. This activity started to pick up pace late in the first quarter, which was sooner than we expected and has continued into April. While these move-outs are pressuring physical occupancy, it will benefit our financial results later in the year as we have good demand in the market to replace these residents with new residents that will pay their rent. Our remaining 2 West Coast markets of San Francisco and Seattle have posted respectable quarter-over-quarter revenue growth with good demand, but pricing power remains less than desired, especially in the urban centers of both of these markets. The San Francisco market is performing in line with our expectations, which already assumed a slow recovery. Use of concessions, mostly in the downtown submarket remains common along with limited pricing power. Meanwhile, the South Bay submarket is demonstrating signs of improving pricing power and stronger occupancy with less widespread concession use based on a combination of factors that includes a greater variety of stable employers who are committed to the area, coupled with just a better overall quality of life. Heading to Seattle, the overall market continues to demonstrate a lack of recovery, which wasn't completely unexpected, but is behind our forecast. Similar to Downtown San Francisco, Downtown Seattle lacks pricing power with concessions being used on over 70% of our applications. The East side, which we felt may hold up a little bit better, is still outperforming downtown, but is a little more challenging than we thought based on supply pressure, layoffs and overall just less hiring in the submarket. Amazon's May 1 mandatory return to the office date has a potential to be a catalyst for this market. Finally, in our expansion markets, which currently make up a little less than 5% of our same-store NOI, revenue performance has mostly been in line with our acquisition performance and guidance expectations. As we expected, we are being impacted by heavy new supply in Austin, Dallas and Denver. Meanwhile, Atlanta remained strong with double-digit revenue growth for the quarter. Now moving to expenses. We reported same-store expense growth of 7.2% in the quarter, which was slightly above our expectations. We had always expected Q1 growth to be higher than our full year guidance range, mostly because the growth during the first quarter of 2022 was so low, but also from pressure on a few specific items that outpaced positives in a few other expense categories. On the favorable side, we continue to benefit from good performance in real estate taxes and payroll, along with utilities, which were still elevated but lower than expected. On the unfavorable side, incremental cost in repairs and maintenance, other on-site costs and higher-than-anticipated insurance costs drove higher-than-expected first quarter same-store expense growth. For most of these costs, we had anticipated an increase but not quite to this degree. Elevated repairs and maintenance was in large part due to increased outsourcing in the quarter much of which stemmed from our own internal teams in California, focusing on the after effects of the severe rainstorms, which resulted in incremental outside vendor assistance.  Higher legal and administrative costs related to faster progress in response to the expiration of the eviction moratorium, the benefit of which can be seen in our bad debt net. Insurance expense was higher due to tougher conditions than the already challenging environment we assumed on the renewal of our property insurance policy, which was completed during the first quarter. Despite this pressure, we remain comfortable with our existing guidance range on the full year same-store expense growth. At this point, we expect slower full year growth in real estate tax and utilities than we initially expected to offset the overages experienced in other categories in the first quarter. Lastly, I want to spend a minute on our focus on innovation and the technology evolution of our platform. In 2023, we have a positive NOI impact of just over $10 million included in our guidance with about 2/3 of that coming on the expense side primarily in payroll and repair and maintenance. This benefit will mostly be realized in second half of the year which will contribute to lower expense growth for that period. On the revenue side we will continue to focus on other income items like WiFi, parking and pricing optimization. We will also leverage data analytics to create opportunities to expand our operating margins. Our vision is to augment pricing and renewal strategies by combining our growing data science capabilities with streamlined execution while delivering self-service solutions to our customers. We will continue to leverage our mobile platform to create opportunities to share on-site employees across multiple properties. With a fully centralized and mobile operating platform, we are in a strong position to create a seamless customer experience with a platform that continues to allow us to innovate, experiment and rapidly scale what works across the portfolio. This uniquely positions our company to continue to create additional revenue streams while managing expenses to maintain and grow margins even in an inflationary climate. I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to their residents and focus on delivering these terrific operating results. With that, we will turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is going to come from Eric Wolfe from Citi. Eric Wolfe : Just looking at your same-store revenue guidance, it looks like you're expecting roughly 4% growth for the rest of the year, maybe a bit higher if you're accounting to be better trends in bad debt. But just curious whether it's sort of the majority of the drop-off happens in 2Q and then sort of stabilizes? Or if the drop-off is a little bit more ratable through the year? Robert Garechana : Eric, it's Bob. I would say that the drop-off is more ratable through the year because what's going on in the 2023 kind of guidance is really more about what's happened in 2022, than the kind of core trajectory of the business. So we continue to expect kind of that sequential leasing component, but you start getting into -- starting in Q2 and really into Q3. Difficult comp periods from 2022. And so you'll see Q1 as the high point and then a pretty consistent but above trend quarter-over-quarter rate of growth as you go through the back end of the year. Eric Wolfe : Got it. And then I think you said you expect the peak leasing season to play out as it normally would. But I also thought I heard you say that rent growth might be a bit more muted for its history. So just trying to tie those 2 statements together? I'm just trying to understand if market rents are sort of growing as they normally would during the peak leasing season. Michael Manelis : Yes. Eric, this is Michael. So I think there's 2 factors. One, the way that the rents are moving, and I said, albeit a little bit muted, that's more indicative to when we think about normal rent patterns of pricing trends. We came into the year with our guidance expecting the sequential build. We just didn't think we were going to see kind of outsized momentum anywhere near the pace that we saw last year. And in terms of the setup right now, I guess I would just say the portfolio is sitting at 96.1% today. We've got great momentum. The blended rate for April sitting right at 4%, you get the sequential build and pricing trend at 3.25%, which basically positions us right where we thought we would be heading into this peak leasing season. Mark Parrell : Yes. Just to supplement that, Eric, it's Mark. It's the difference between guidance when we gave our guidance, we talked about the year being kind of like a normal year 2023, but maybe a little bit less of intra-period growth and what's going on so far this year. And so far this year, absolutely consistent with that expectation. So it's -- those 2 terms are being used to describe different things, guidance versus so far so good this year. Operator : Our next question is going to come from John Pawlowski from Green Street. John Pawlowski : Bob, the first question is on real estate taxes. I know this year is faring well. Just be curious, as you stare out the next few years, are you seeing any early examples or hearing any chatter that cities need to tax apartments a little bit harder to fill the hole left by office and other commercial real estate sectors that are seeing impaired valuations? Robert Garechana : Yes, I would say that not a lot of chatter yet because we're really just focused on 2023. And to your point, John, 2023 is actually better than what we anticipated.  Obviously, we have that Anchor with prop 13 in California, which is helpful. As you move beyond, you always deal with that issue of revenue gaps and budgetary gaps and where people are going to get money out of what pocket. So far, we feel good about where we are, very good about where we are in 2023. And it's too early to tell -- but with these municipalities, what they'll do in 2024, what those revenue gaps will look like and where -- what pockets they'll come to get it. So, so far, I'd say too early to tell for '24. John Pawlowski : Okay. And then last one for me. Michael, just curious if you could expand on the softness in pricing power you're seeing in Denver and your expansion markets. I know it's a small sample size of properties, but just curious how you're seeing fundamentals on the ground there relative to some softer West Coast markets. Michael Manelis : Yes. I mean I think I would carve them out a little bit different. So Denver, you clearly have supply pressure sitting on top of us in the downtown submarket, but yet the suburban portfolios are actually doing pretty well. When we go into the Texas markets, we clearly are seeing just more concessions being used. You have demand, right? But when you look at across all of these expansion markets, any of the reported data, including our own portfolio, which again is a pretty small subset. It's less than 5% of the company's NOI. The occupancies tend to be running lower in these kind of expansion markets for us. The one exception I would say for us is Atlanta, seems to be doing a little bit better than even what we thought coming into the year. We just don't have quite as much supply pressure on us. So we see a little bit better pricing power than what we thought. John Pawlowski : Okay. Would you expect Denver and Texas NOI growth to lag or outpace your legacy footprint over the next year or 2? Michael Manelis : Oh, I mean I think clearly, our coastal markets right now are set up not even for this year, but just the entire setup, the demand drivers that we see, the cost of housing in those markets has really positioned them to outperform. But again, as we went into these sunbelt, we knew like what to expect for these first couple of years. So for us, the positive is that -- the large majority of our acquisitions are trending slightly ahead of how we perform in them and clearly in line with our expectations for this year. Operator : Next question is from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Stephen Sakwa : Just a couple of follow-ups on the topline growth. Michael, I know you don't necessarily guide to leasing spreads, new renewals or blend. But just any thoughts on kind of where our spreads might be for the year? And it certainly sounded like bad debt is trending better. I realize it might be a little too early, but how much of a tailwind could that be if things continue sort of on the path they're on today? Michael Manelis : Yes. Well, maybe I'll start, and Bob, you can kind of build a little bit on the bad debt. So in terms of just the leasing spreads and kind of guide, a lot of that had to do with where we were with our embedded growth, where we were with loss to lease, capturing the loss to lease. And I think I said, right, as we were working through the call back in February, we expected roughly 2%, 2.25% on new lease change for the full year, renewals right around 5% and blended is right around 4% for the full year. When you look at where we sit today, we're set up going into our peak leasing season, where, again, we're going to do 60% of the transaction. We're set up right where we thought we would be relative to the guidance. We have a little bit of pressure that we're doing more concessions in those downtown submarkets in Seattle and San Francisco. But that's kind of being offset by some of the outperformance we're seeing in the East Coast markets. Robert Garechana : Yes. And Steve, on the bad debt side, just to fill out the question, we are -- we certainly did better in the first quarter. We expected the first quarter to sequentially be equivalent, excluding governmental rental assistance to the fourth quarter, and we're a couple of million dollars better. And that equates to a little bit under 10 basis points on a full year basis for revenue. That trajectory is continuing into April, so it's still early. And so we would expect to perform better overall. But keep in mind, the 90 basis points assume that we're having improvement. So it's just how much that improvement is better relative to what we embedded in guidance, but we do think there's potential upside there. To the extent we continue to see that same pace as we play out through April into May and the rest of the year. Mark Parrell : And Steve, it's Mark. Just to help you with your mod a little. The governmental payments are really key to the volatility because in the first quarter of '22, we got about $9.5 million of governmental rental relief. In the second quarter, we got almost $15 million in 2022. So we need to make up that difference in terms of improved delinquency performance in the second quarter. And then you drop all the way down to a little below $6 million in the third quarter and then only $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. So you can see that those rental relief payments are key to understanding. So the delinquency, we think, will improve the whole year, but there could be quarters where bad debt net because it's being compared to a number with so much governmental rental relief in it is just not as good as it appears to be, and then the next quarter, you'll see it even back out. Stephen Sakwa : Okay. And then just, I guess, second question is on sort of capital deployment. I mean, you guys did raise acquisitions and dispositions to still be net zero. But I'm just curious what -- and maybe distress you're sort of seeing in the marketplace and what opportunities that might afford you thinking back to the coming out of GFC, you guys were early to buy broken condos and did the transaction. I'm just curious if you're starting to see things percolate and -- and I guess secondly, are you seeing a big slowdown in new starts or planned starts from maybe some of the competitors and merchant builders? Alexander Brackenridge : Steve, this is Alex. Well, first of all, transaction volume is down pretty dramatically. So the closings will be down about 60-plus percent across the country. And that's pretty evenly spread among the different markets. So a lot less activity, but the sellers that do act now understand that cap rates are somewhere between 5% and 5.25%. So they're eager to transact. And that comes from really 3 different types of sellers. There's the private REITs that have the redemption request that they have to fulfill.  So we're seeing some activity from them. The merchant builders aren't really capitalized to own property in the long run. They always expect it to be able to execute and get out of the deal. So a little bit of that. And gives some floating rate borrowers who have caps that are expiring that they are not able to cover. So there are sources of opportunity, but it's really been slow so far. But I would expect all 3 of those areas are more likely to pick up than not in the next 6 months.  So we are excited to deploy more capital as those opportunities arise. And as you mentioned in the past, we've taken advantage of dislocation in the market. So we're certainly set up to that. But in the meantime, we're trading in and out of properties, so selling -- dispose opportunistically and taking advantage of acquisitions that we see. In terms of starts, I mean, they're dramatically down. Already this year, what we were thinking in our markets would be, say, 110,000 starts is now looking like it might be half of that today, and I expect even more things that we thought might start will drop off the list through the rest of the year. It's really hard to make a development work in an environment where cap rates are, as I said, 5% to 5.25%, you need a yield at least around a 6%. And you just can't get there with costs that may not be rising as high as quickly as they used to a year or so ago, but they're still going up, and obviously, financing costs are higher. So it's just really hard to make a development underwrite. So we expect to see more and more deals drop out, development deals. Mark Parrell : Yes. And Steve, it's Mark. Just to supplement that. I mean all this supply in the Sunbelt markets, Denver, places we'd like more long-term exposure, but we recognize that it's going to be a tough couple of years, that's an opportunity for us. I mean we're going to sell low performing assets in the coastal markets are assets where we have an over concentration in the sub market and kind of trade in and accepting that there might be a little near-term decline and putting it in the pro forma. But as you said, I mean, I'm very hopeful. I think we're in a really good spot where our numbers are going to show well comparatively in the costal markets, we'll exercise our usual good expense control, and then we'll turn around and deploy capital. And Alex got a big team, a very capable, experienced people out there ready to buy. So I think we'll be active as soon as those opportunities are more substantial. Operator : Our next question comes from Chandni Luthra from Goldman Sachs. Chandni Luthra : This is Chandni Luthra, Goldman. Could you guys help us understand what the collections process will look like from here? And what the magnitude and timing of recovery from past accounts could shape up to be. Like do you have to go to courts to get rents from tenants who are perhaps no longer active with you or you're just evicting now? And what kind of experience are folks witnessing with the court processes these days? Michael Manelis : Yes. Chandni, it's Michael. So we clearly have evictions filed right now with the courts. You are seeing a little bit of momentum pick up. I would tell you across the country right now, it feels like most of this stuff is set up at about a 6-month timeframe from the time you file to the time you actually get to your proceeding with a court date.  But really what's happening on the collections front is twofold. So one, you have individuals that you are filing on that have a lot of past balances with you. But if they start paying you current month's rent, those past balances are somewhat protected still to date and go out into like '24. I think maybe some of them even stretch into '25. So you have a little bit of a longer tail to go after the previous balances to collect. But we are starting to see this resident behavior where they're making decisions either to move out in front of any kind of eviction proceeding or actually just start paying us their current month's rent knowing that we're ultimately going to have to come to terms with what happens with this previous balance. In areas where those balances are not protected, we have sent much of that over to the collection agencies and let collection agencies start working.  That's a slow process because typically, what you need to see is a lifestyle change. You need to see somebody needing to go buy a car or a home or some other thing that then causes them to come to terms that they got to clean up that balance. So I think what you should expect to see is the court system is going to continue to move at this pace of, call it, the 6-month window. And you'll see us gradually just start chipping away at this delinquency and gradually start to improve the recovery of this -- of the past balance. Chandni Luthra : So then can there be a reversal to some write-offs or some reserves that you've taken in the past as we sort of think about the magnitude going forward? Robert Garechana : Yes, certainly. To the extent that all of those historical balances that Michael just described have been written off. So to the extent that you collect them, you would see that as a current period pickup offsetting bad debt. So those collections would flow through. But as Michael mentioned, we would expect that. We don't -- haven't really incorporated much of that overall that we'd expect that to really trail. Chandni Luthra : Got it. Very helpful. And a follow-up question is on L.A. mansion tax. So obviously, you guys sold a property ahead of that sort of tax change on April 1. But as we think about the composition of your current portfolio and what you've laid out in the past that you want basically 33% of your portfolio. It's sitting in sort of each of the coasts and then 33 in the Sunbelt. How do you think about the impact from this policy change to affect how you think about sort of selling properties in L.A. going forward and you're reaching towards that optimal mix of geography that you've laid out in the past? Alexander Brackenridge : Well, clearly, it has an impact. It's a big move in the rate from 1.5% to 5.5% in L.A. And it was designed to raise cap the [indiscernible] money for cities to build affordable housing. I think it probably had the reverse effect and that there won't be that many transactions, so they're not going to collect very much. So it may be that this gets reduced over time. So we don't know that it will be around forever because it doesn't seem to be well thought out public policy. But in the meantime, there are other ways -- other properties that aren't subject to the tax within California that we can transact on. And we can also consider joint ventures as an opportunity to lower exposure in a market like L.A., where selling a property may not make a lot of sense. Mark Parrell : Yes. Chandni, it's Mark. And just to supplement Alex answer. We -- I mean, it certainly impacts the tactical way to get to the success to lower that exposure. But mean we remain committed to the goal, and we're just going to figure out different ways to do it. And again, maybe you're selling properties in Ventura County instead or in -- outside the city of San Francisco and the County of Los Angeles, and we have plenty of those, too. So we've got other levers to pull, and we'll be thoughtful about that. Operator : Next question goes to Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Michael Goldsmith : On the concessions, have they gotten better or worse as the year has progressed? And is the gap between markets? Is it getting lighter or narrower? Michael Manelis : Yes. So Michael, this is Michael. So concessions for us right now are really concentrated in those urban centers of Seattle and San Francisco. I think what you saw when we turned the corner into January, and we were getting on that first -- or the fourth quarter call, I was telling you that the demand was picking up, and you saw the concessions starting to slow down across most of the markets that absolutely held true almost all of the markets now have weaned themselves off of the concessions, except what we saw in somewhere around that middle of February and into March, you really saw the concession use pick up in those downtown urban centers of Seattle and San Francisco, and they've been fairly constant. I'll tell you the last couple of weeks, we see a little bit of hope right now that the demand is picking up. Application volume is picking up in those areas, and you could start to see us get to a place where we could start pulling them back again. But for the most part, just in the rearview mirror, they've been constant for the last couple of months for us. Michael Goldsmith : That's very helpful. And then my second question is on the transaction market. Does this 5.7% stabilized cap rate on the Atlanta deal, does that represent a motivated seller or a function of the actual market? Is this where deals are going forward? And maybe just on a broader terms, like -- are you starting to see a reopening of the transaction market now that you're guiding to a modest amount of activity in the year? Alexander Brackenridge : Michael, this is Alex. The 5.7% really isn't a reflection of market. It's more a reflection of the property being in lease-up right now. So we're taking it over the middle of a lease-up and we're going to finish it off. So we're getting compensated for doing that. So I would say, as I said earlier on the call, the rates are somewhere between 5% and 5.25% for a typical deal. And so yes, we're getting a little bit of a boost there because we're taking on a little bit of a lease-up, but that's not an indication of market. And then in terms of other opportunities, I mean, we're obviously always looking for other opportunities, and it has been pretty slow though so far. Operator : Our next question will come from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Nicholas Yulico : So I want to go back to the topic of job losses. And I know you said that you're really not seeing that much of an impact. But are there any indications yet of job losses of residents impacting expected turnover? I mean, is there anything you're learning now as you're sending renewal notices out for the spring? And I guess if there's any differentiation you're seeing on this topic between tech heavier markets like San Francisco, Bay Area, Seattle, where there has been more high-profile job losses announced versus other markets of yours. Mark Parrell : Yes, Nick, it's Mark. I'm going to start, and Michael is going to supplement with some market specifics. I mean, again, when we look at the general economics, professional and business services, for example, still has positive job growth. And that's an area where we do have a lot of our residents employed.  Finance and insurance kind of flat, information service is certainly down but not down that dramatically, and the unemployment rate remains very low, especially for the college educated. So I guess, I just want to point out again on the macro. The macro picture is very good for our company and for the markets we sit in, not just in the long term, but in the near term in the here and now. So certainly, there can be another shoe that drops, but the current numbers we're all seeing are certainly declined from the COVID recovery numbers, but they're still pretty good, and people losing jobs are finding them. And that's been the experience that looks to me like in the general economy. And I'll let Michael comment on what he's seeing in the rest of our portfolio. Michael Manelis : Yes. And I think, one, you got to put into context that the reported turnover for the first quarter was really low. I mean it's not quite record little, but it's really low number. So the absolute number of move-outs that we're having is clearly below any kind of historical norms. And when we start drilling in and we look at those reasons for move-out, we're really not seeing anything indicative of changes. You're not seeing kind of job loss or job change pick up anything different than what you would expect for the first quarter of any given year. Specific into like a Seattle or San Francisco where you saw kind of more of the headlines and we said on the last call, we thought a lot of those layoffs were being dispersed across the country, not just heavily concentrated in those markets. I think what you've seen, we have not seen anybody really give us keys telling us they're breaking the lease or they're not renewing because they were laid off.  What we do notice in those 2 markets is the in-migration, meaning what percent of brand new residents are coming to us from outside of that MSA. The in-migration in those 2 areas is less than what you otherwise would have expected, which I think makes sense given not only the layoffs, but more importantly, like the hiring freezes that have been taking place. So you're just not seeing them draw into the market like they used to. Nicholas Yulico : That's very helpful. My second question is going back to Los Angeles. And it's a market that doesn't look like it has much supply, except for Downtown. And you did talk about delinquent -- dealing with delinquent units going forward, right? In some cases, it's impacting occupancy right now or at some point, it will. And I guess what I'm wondering is how you think -- how you feel comfortable with this. It's almost like a shadow supply type of scenario where you and other landlords are finally getting tenants out in L.A. and that you feel confident that there's enough demand to fill tenants leaving? Mark Parrell : Yes. Again, it's Mark, Nick to start, and Michael may have something to add here. But I'll start by talking about the employment base of our residents as we see it in the market. So we looked at sort of the big tech majors, and we said what percent of our residents have stated that they're employed by those big companies in Los Angeles, and that's something on the order of 3%. So I think we just have very low exposure to those sort of tech folks in the very diversified L.A. economy. So I think L.A. just, frankly, is stronger than San Francisco Bay Area and stronger than Seattle right now where we have higher numbers of our residents employed by those sorts of people and probably bigger local economic impacts. So I think we're, in your opinion -- it's almost like we have 2 empty buildings in Los Angeles, we're delivering into same-store over the rest of this year and that we're going to fill up, and we've got the demand for it. So I think when you look at the local economy, that matches up very well with our portfolio. They're in content creation. They're in other businesses, some of which feel some pressure. But this disproportionate tech layoff, that isn't a Los Angeles phenomenon that's occurring to all over the country. In the extent there's any concentration, it's more San Francisco and Seattle than it is L.A. Nicholas Yulico : Yes, No, I wasn't specifically really wondering about tech in L.A. I just meant the issue of delinquent units coming back to market for you and other landlords, right, as you're getting people out and rates almost a supply issue in the market. Mark Parrell : Yes, but the supply is being met by people that have jobs. That was the point of my comment. It isn't -- a lot of these people are in diversified industries. So it isn't like everyone is losing their job down in Los Angeles. There's -- it's very well employed down there. A lot of people looking for housing, a lot of demand, Michael sees good demand numbers in terms of applications and the like. So that's the source of our confidence, a diversified economy in which -- like I said, us and others are effectively delivering empty buildings into that, but I'm confident that demand will need it given what we see on the ground and given the composition of employment in the market. Operator : The next question comes from Rich Anderson from SMBC is next. Richard Anderson : So back to the bad debt question. If you were to sort of magically flip a switch and you'd be back to 40 basis points bad debt like you'd see normally, would that recovery be less than the rent relief number that you -- gathered last year about $32 million. I'm wondering how much the rent relief overcompensated you or maybe under compensate you for the bad debt that you took on? I'm just trying to understand that math. Robert Garechana : Yes. So -- the government -- you're right, the governmental rental relief in '22 was $32 million. You would have to get back to, call it, 40, 50 basis points normal, that's $1 million a month of bad debt. If you look at kind of the disclosure for Q1, we were averaging like probably around -- certainly in January and February, more like . So it's like a $3 million spread -- so you'd have to get $3 million times the 12 months or so is about where you'd be at, which would be a little bit more than what the governmental rental relief would be. But you're getting there if you got back to, call it, that $1 million a month right away. That's obviously not what's happening yet. We're hopeful that, that happens and the sooner the better from a growth perspective. Does that help, Rich? Richard Anderson : Yes, yes. That's great. And then my second question is, Michael, I think you mentioned you're running a 3.25% market rent growth at this point. If memory serves, I think you said your guidance presumed 3% market rent growth for 2023. And I know you guys are trying to be careful about overpromising having not updated guidance yet, and that's coming later. But it seems to me you're ahead of the schedule from a market rent growth, particularly at this point in the year, shouldn't 3.25% barring a major disruption from some sort of recession. Shouldn't that really be a maybe a significantly bigger number as you get into the heavy leasing season and maybe that will be another driving force to you upticking your guidance, just a better market rent growth trajectory than you expected? If you could comment on that, please. Michael Manelis : Yes. I mean I think, Rich, you can look at that and say the 3.25% sequential build from January 1 is about where we peg where we should be of what a normal cycle is. The 3% for the full year, remember, you got to blend in what happens due in that first quarter and the fourth quarter. So when you put it all into the blender, could you be up at a 4%, 4.5% in the peak leasing season? Sure. And you still could average to the 3% for the full year.  So I think I would just look at the trajectory that we see the sequential build of application volume and the sequential build of this net effective pricing trend is basically resulting in us being right on top of where we thought we would be from the blended rate growth, which is what manifests itself to the P&L. Operator : The next question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Bradley Heffern : Circling back on bad debt. So it was 1.7% of revenue in the first quarter, excluding the assistance payments. But you obviously mentioned that it improved in March and April. So I'm curious if you can just compare the whatever leading-edge figure you have to that 1.7%. Robert Garechana : Yes. So that would probably be -- the 1.7% would probably be something, call it, 20 basis points better, maybe a little bit more, maybe 30. Bradley Heffern : Okay. Perfect. And then going back to next question. You gave the 3% employed by Big Tech in LA figure. I'm curious if you have the figures handy for the Bay Area and for Seattle and if there are any other markets like, I don't know, New York that have a larger number too. Mark Parrell : Yes. I've got some numbers for you. I don't have the East Coast, but the Bay Area is about 14%. And Seattle is about 30%. Operator : Next question comes from Haendel Juste from Mizuho. Haendel St. Juste: A couple for me. I guess first question is can you provide the new and renewal numbers for March specifically? And where are you sending out renewal rates today for May? And what's the loss to lease in the portfolio today? Michael Manelis : Yes. Okay. So let me just start with loss to lease. So we snapshot that on the 15th of every month. By April 15, we were at 3.4%, which basically compares to, I think we are 1.5% on January 15 again, trending in line with where you would have expected it to be.  In terms of like the March, April, I will tell you both new lease and renewals are basically flat when you look at it sequentially. You look at the blended rate, and you can see that we're moving from a 3.8% in March to a 4.0% expected in April. So again, right in line with what we would think based on the sequential build heading into the peak leasing season. If I look forward to think about transactions that are on the books for May, so we have renewals on the books, we've got some expected move-ins for leases that just haven't started yet. Those are also trending in line with what you would expect, which you're starting to see that improvement kick into gear on new lease change and you got that consistency on renewal. In terms of the forward view on renewals, we've got quotes sitting out there for the next 90 days. I think I said in the prepared remarks, we really do expect a lot of consistency here. We're renewing about 55% to 60%. We don't see any reason not to expect that in the next several months going forward. We're achieving somewhere in this 5.5% to 6% achieved renewal rate increase each month. We don't see a significant change there. We have a lot of confidence in this renewal process. My expectation is we turn to corner to the second half of the year. We do expect to see a little bit of moderation on renewals, probably more like in that 4% to 5% range, which is just a function of the comp period and what we see as we return to more of a normal pricing trend. Haendel St. Juste: Very helpful. Another question on, I guess, some of the charges in the quarter. It sounds like the property, legal and admin charges are tied to the eviction process, but can you comment on the other charges, the $5 million environment settlement and the $2 million data transformation project and if we should expect those in future quarters, too. Mark Parrell : And I'll start. Bob will help here a little. The data transformation project is something we're working on. We mentioned this before in prior calls. It's a big data analytics project with an outside vendor. You can expect a couple of million dollars more there and then it should be at an end.  All of our internal employee hires and all that, that's in our normal overhead load. So continuing costs are in the run rate of the business. The sort of discrete onetime sort of events are separately categorized, as we said on the Page 24 of the release. And I don't know, Bob, if you want to comment on the risk. Robert Garechana : Yes. The other components are adjustments to various kind of regular course litigation reserves that we made during the quarter as we got more information and adjusted our outlook. So those are all case-by-case dependent and depend on facts and circumstances at the moment. Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. And one more question on cost. Is there any part of the property damage from the cost in California at the rain storms. Any part of that recoverable perhaps from insurance? Mark Parrell : No, this all falls, it's Mark, below our deductible handouts. So this is all covered by us. Operator : Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : So two questions. First, on the insurance, you guys mentioned that and we've heard from others that insurance has become more challenging, expensive, especially in like Florida and Texas. So 2 parts to this. In your experience, do you would expect that the insurance provider will rapidly adjust new capital come in and that this won't really be a problem? Or do you think that it's actually could give you some opportunities to buy deals where the existing owner can't get insurance on their property and therefore, provides you guys with some opportunity to buy some of those in some of the expansion markets. Mark Parrell : It's Mark. It's a good question. The insurance market typically has, as you suggested, when you see costs go up as much as this capacity has gone up. We don't yet see that. And the difference now is that fixed income is a real alternative. I mean folks that are reinsurers can invest in a lot of different things. And the fixed income market and maybe even these beaten down equity values may be more interesting to them. So there's a little more competition for those reinsurance dollars that investment. So in the off-season here because we just renewed our policy program -- our property program last month, Alex, we're going to be out there looking for other capacity in other places because I'm not sure given the severity of this named windstorm risk that we're going to be able to find additional capacity for that risk. Now EQR doesn't have Florida exposure, and we don't have that risk, but it has impacted other spots in the market. And other folks have much larger increases than we had. Ours was about 20% on our property program. So I would say I would expect normally for the market to get bigger, I wonder this time how quickly that's going to occur, given concerns that these sort of wind storms, especially are going to be more continuous than they've been in the past and just alternatives that insurers have and reinsurers have to invest elsewhere. So hopefully, that's helpful. Alexander Goldfarb : That is. The second question is the tax deal that you did in Atlanta, you guys have previously spoken about the 421a is here in New York and the drag it cost to earnings when those tax incentives dried up -- or sorry, matured off -- burned off. Do you see similar with the Atlanta and in general, are you looking to do more tax deals or your preferences to shy away from them except where on a case-by-case basis. Mark Parrell : Yes, a great question. We certainly like not to repeat things like that. You got to look at the IRR in the deal. You start with these elevated cash flows, you're getting a little bit better cap rate because of the fact that later on, you're going to be paying these higher taxes. So for us in year 8 or 9, taxes are going to go up and you're going to really have this flatten out. But it's not the order of magnitude of the 421a program. So -- and we also keep track, Alex, of these. So we're not allowing any 1 year to be overburdened. So we don't feel like we're robbing Peter to pay Paul as long as we're comfortable with our IRR. So as our overall IRR, we being paid upfront, for the cash flow growth flatness that will occur 8, 9, 10 years from now. And I think we feel like we were, and we'll do deals like that.  And most of the new product is going to have stuff like this. So we'll also buy some stuff that's a little bit older. Alex and his team are looking at those kind of deals as well where you won't have that but if you have an older deal, remember, you're going to be putting in a lot more capital. So it's not possible to avoid some sort of cost here because if we bought something 10 years old that had fully stabilized taxes in Atlanta, it probably would require more capital, and that would affect the IRR. So we're going to look at the IRR and use that as our check on that. Alexander Brackenridge : And in some cases, Alex, this is Alex. As the abatement burns off or when it burns off, some of the units might go to market. So you got to pick up there, too. So it's not all downside. Operator : And Jamie Feldman from Wells Fargo. James Feldman : I guess just big picture to your comments on maybe assets come to market for investment. Your leverage tick lower in the quarter. It looks like you've been met -- this year, you plan to match fund acquisitions with dispositions. To the extent you want to put incremental capital to work beyond asset sales just because you see so much opportunity. Can you just talk about the sources of capital to do that, you're having conversations with potential JV partners? If so, what kind of capital looks interested? And then what would you be willing to do in terms of leverage? And how do you think about your liquidity position today for investment? Mark Parrell : So first off, there isn't such a significant opportunity out there that it's worth using our precious leverage capacity or issuing a bunch of equity below what we think the intrinsic worth of the business is. So I haven't been presented yet with that issue. Talking to the Board, we're certainly willing to take leverage up. We have a stated leverage policy, Bob? Robert Garechana : By 5 to 6x net debt to EBITDA. Mark Parrell : Yes. And we're approaching 3x so into the 3x. So I would say to you that there are several billion dollars of capacity in the system to buy great assets at great prices using debt when and if we see those opportunities, and we're looking hard for those. We don't see them yet. But I'd start with debt. But certainly, the JV market is another source of capital. We're very aware of that. The private market continues to love the apartment industry, even if the public markets are being buffeted a little bit by some of these cross wins. So we're out there looking for other sources of capital for sure. James Feldman : And can you talk about the returns that private market is looking for. Are those sources of capital are looking for? How are they underwriting apartments today? And what kind of trends are they looking for? Alexander Brackenridge : Generally, there -- this is Alex. Generally, they're looking for the same kind of return, a cap rate of, say, 5%, 5.25%, depending on the assets that we would see in the transactions market. James Feldman : Okay. And then finally, I mean, to your comments and everyone's comments, I mean, there's so much talk about supply. When you just think about the next 6 months, 9 months or 12 months, 24 months, like when do you think the supply chain really starts to kick in based on the delivery scale? Mark Parrell : Just to make sure I understand the question. When do we think supply will start going down based on deliveries? I'm sorry, didn't near the end of that. James Feldman : No. I mean I know in your comments, you feel somewhat protected from supply based on where your assets are located. But clearly, a very large pipeline set to deliver over the next 2 years. When do you think that supply really starts to be felt nationally? It certainly doesn't feel [indiscernible] several months. Mark Parrell : I think you've got the stuff it's going to get completed. I would say you're looking more in like '25 and '26. I mean stuff you start now -- I mean, if you've got your capital stack and you're able to start, you're going to deliver. I mean, you may deliver a quarter late because of the supply chain, but you're going to deliver. So I think the starts Alex referred to, will impact '25's count will be lower and '26's count will be lower but stuff for this year and next, that's expected to deliver will deliver. And I think some of the numbers in some of the markets, some of which we're interested in, like Denver and Austin are really large.  And that's a terrific opportunity for us to buy. And to sell some of these assets where we're overallocated in some of the coastal markets. And I think that's going to be an attractive play for us. Operator : And John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : I realize unemployment remains pretty healthy. It seems like demand is going very well for you guys. There have been some reports of employers delaying start dates for new hires. And I'm wondering if you've seen any softness in demand as it pertains to the upcoming graduate pool? Michael Manelis : John, this is Michael. I don't -- I haven't heard that. I mean I did hear a few kind of comments from prospects around what time they're looking for. So typically, they're showing uptake in tours. And these folks were thinking more like the June, July timeframe. There's definitely a little pause in the prospects decision-making process right now around, are there going to be more layoffs, will they actually get the offer to start when they want it. But it's nothing of a material nature because, again, our sequential build of application volumes, our foot traffic year-over-year, all of those things are trending in line with what we would say is a normal seasonal pattern. So we haven't seen anything like that. John Kim : Okay. My second question is, I think, for Bob, but on the litigation reserve that you incurred this quarter, is this something that may be ongoing? And is this related to RealPage? Mark Parrell : Yes, it's Mark. I'll take that. So being in a consumer-facing business, there's always some level of litigation costs. They're widely varying. There's no significant amount of RealPage related costs in there, but they are in there, but it's relatively small. The reason for that is that the case is at its early stages. And you should think about that going on for a longer period of time. They aren't resolved in weeks or months. It's more like years. But again, we feel very strongly about our position. We think these claims are without merit, and we're going to defend ourselves, and we continue to feel really confident in our prospects there. So there is some small amount, but it's small. Most of that just relates to just continuing legal costs from being in a customer-facing business in an industry that has regulation. Operator : Next question comes from Adam Kramer from Morgan Stanley. Adam Kramer : Yes, I just wanted to ask about this California storm damage kind of cost. Look, I appreciate kind of the disclosure around 1Q impacts. Wondering just on if there will be further impacts in particular, if you could kind of quantify maybe the 2Q impacts or any other impacts going forward? Robert Garechana : Yes. Thanks, Adam. It's Bob. Our expectation is that there won't be anything material going forward into Q2 related to these specific storms. Obviously, if there's a different event, then we don't know. But as it relates to this, there's nothing material that's moving the numbers soon for Q2. Adam Kramer : Great. And then just on thinking through occupancy and kind of the occupancy versus renewal, renewal kind of pushing renewals kind of trade off. Look, recognizing occupancy, there's some drivers there in terms of physical occupancy, right, kind of what's happening on the on the bad debt and eviction side.  But just thinking through how was that kind of -- that trade-off that you guys going through, right, managing occupancy versus pushing renewals? How would that conversation maybe evolved from 4Q to 1Q to today? Is there a change in kind of how you're approaching that and how much you're kind of willing or able to push renewals? Michael Manelis : Yes. Well, I think you could see just that sequential build that we have right now and the achieved renewal increase shows that we are pushing on that front. I mean every market has a different balance act that's going on between the trade-offs of occupancy and renewals. I mean for us, the preference clearly would be to continue to renew as many residents as possible because, one, we avoid the turn cost; and two, we avoid the vacancy loss with that. So you're seeing us do a little bit more negotiation across many of the markets right now. But again, we're well positioned, which gives us that confidence to keep kind of pushing on that rate in the marketplace that not only fuels the new lease change, but also helps the future months renewals as well. So I think this trade-off is constantly balanced. And honestly, we're looking at these markets every week going through that conversation now that we have the centralized renewal team, which is which way are we leaning. Operator : And Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Linda Tsai : I know you just emphasized IRR of individual deals, but the higher taxes and insurance occurring in the expansion markets, does this shift the attractiveness of these regions long term? Mark Parrell : There's no riskless apartment market, and it's Mark. I'll start, and Alex may supplement it. I mean, if you're buying in some markets, you're going to have higher insurance costs, but maybe lower political risk. And then another market, you may have slightly higher political risk and a lot better resilience and maybe a better supply picture. Our whole investment thought process of being diversified is premised on the idea of kind of accepting these risks in small doses across the whole country and staying tied to these affluent renters so it doesn't change our mind.  We just underwrite it and the deals will either work or they won't. I do think that some of the markets that have outperformed lately in the Sunbelt that have resilience challenges are really going to be pressed by these insurance costs. And frankly, maybe even the availability of financing if insurance is unavailable at some of the issue lenders are very sensitive to. But from our point of view, I mean, we're just going to run the numbers. I think these markets continue to have other subjective factors that are valuable to us. And I think they're going to remain investable the ones that we're interested in, for sure. Linda Tsai : And then just on the strength you're seeing in New York and Atlanta. Could you talk about that a little more? Michael Manelis : Yes. I mean -- this is Michael. I said in the prepared remarks, I mean, New York, the strength is really kind of widespread across all of the submarkets where you have good demand, you have pricing power, you have the sequential build of the demand and rents moving up with really strong kind of results, both on the retention as well as the achieved renewal increase. In Atlanta, I think right now, relative to our expectations, we feel really good. We're not having that like direct supply pressure on us. We're not seeing kind of heavy use of concessions in our portfolio, and we have demand. And even the deals that we're looking at, one that we have to go through the lease-up or finish the lease-up on, we got a lot of confidence in the velocity, the weekly velocity of application volume there that they're going to perform really well. Operator : Omotayo Okusanya from Credit Suisse. Omotayo Okusanya : Yes. On just capital recycling and the updated guidance there. I get it of buying assets that higher cap rates and selling us at a lower cap rate and kind of creating value that way. But I'm curious with your implied cap at like 6% at this point, according to our math, you did make some comments earlier on about kind of development starts slowing because that development doesn't tend to allow. How do you kind of think about that on the other side of the story, which is the acquisition side, are still -- is the idea still things are not going to be able to kind of pencil out for a while? And unless you're kind of matching asset sales versus acquisitions, you don't expect to kind of be doing much out there on the acquisition side as well? Alexander Brackenridge : It's really -- as you said -- Tayo, this is Alex, about matching the sales and the acquisition. So we keep track of that. We don't get ahead of ourselves on either side and just match them up and it's a neutral bet, but we feel like we're accomplishing our goal of diversifying the footprint. Omotayo Okusanya : And the focus from an acquisition perspective remains in your newer markets rather than some of the more established markets. Alexander Brackenridge : Quiet primarily, but also in the sub of our established markets. And as we've talked about, being opportunistic, there may be opportunities that come up. There's more dislocation that are appealing anywhere and we would chase those. Omotayo Okusanya : Got you. Okay. That's helpful. Would there be any interest in doing something in regards to office to resi conversion from your end or just the development risk and everything is just way too great for you? Mark Parrell : Well, I'm going to split it up because there's the urban conversion of these office buildings that are really giant 1-block floor plates. It's very challenging in urban locations to take a property on LaSalle Street in Chicago or in Midtown Manhattan, it spans a block and doesn't have a lot of windows relative to the total floor space, doesn't have a lot of plumbing fixtures. There's been work done by engineering firms in Boston, for example, on this. And there's relatively few of these buildings -- these large buildings that are going to work as repositioning plays. They may work if the building isn't there anymore, but they're just taking that building and some of our reengineering it is going to be tough. In the suburbs, you may -- and this has been common in the Bay Area and in suburban Washington. You may scrape an office park and build apartments there. And we've been involved in those sort of plays, but those are different altogether because you're not reusing the building. So I think reusing an office building is tough in an urban situation just because of the need for plumbing fixtures in the unit and the need for windows that these larger office buildings just don't allow very well. But I would say, as urban owners, we'd like to see the central business district -- office districts thrive. I mean they pay taxes that support transit, that support public safety, we want those to be repositioned.  It will just take more time and likely be more costly and extensive than some observers seem to think. I just don't think you can snap your finger and take a 4-year-old office building and turn it into a livable awesome apartment building in the center of whether it's Manhattan or the center of Los Angeles. So we'll kind of play wait-and-see on that, but urban repositionings for us are not likely in place. Alexander Brackenridge : And in New York, downtown where it was done a lot. That was on the back of a tax abatement that since expired. The 421g was specifically to promote the conversion. So it doesn't happen easily and it does need -- it generally does need public policy support. Operator : And our next question comes from Josh Dennerlein from Bank of America. Joshua Dennerlein : I just wanted to touch base on the new lease change in April relative to 1Q. It looks like it kind of stepped up 30 basis points. How does that compare to kind of the typical acceleration in April versus 1Q? Michael Manelis : I don't know if I looked historically back, I will tell you it's sitting right on top of what we modeled at the beginning of the year, which is what we would say more like a 2019, 2018 kind of curve and expectation. Some of this just has to do with the timing of who moved out? What was their previous lease? So when I look at the 30 basis points growth, I would just tell you any time you look at these statistics or these metrics on such a short time period of time, it does create some volatility with it. So we tend to look at this over the longer stretch. And right now, I've said this a couple of that, we're sitting right where we kind of modeled for the year and write what we would expect based on just the normal sequential build. Joshua Dennerlein : Okay. It sounds like concessions use picked up in March and April in Yale in San Francisco. If you stripped out those 2 markets, how is kind of new lease rate trending? Michael Manelis : I think the impact on the overall portfolio was like 20 or 30 basis points on the net effective, like new lease change. So if you just pulled out those 2 markets with the heavy concession use, I think that was what the impact was. Joshua Dennerlein : Okay. And then just digging down into same-store expenses, I don't think we've touched on the other on-site operating expenses on the call. I think that's where kind of people kind of use flow through for the evictions. What's kind of the expectation in that line item going into 2Q, just given the move-outs? Robert Garechana : Yes. Josh, it's Bob. Our expectation is that, that could be pretty bumpy because -- if you think about the expense, the expense is really in advance, oftentimes is in advance of the actual move-out. So it depends on how quickly and how fast the cases get filed, which we've made a good amount of progress faster than what we thought in the first quarter.  We'll have some go into the second quarter. That line item is normally a line item that barely grows for us. And so it will be bumpy because of this elevated activity, but it will be lumpy. So just expect it to be kind of grow above trend relative to history and be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, hopefully tailing off as we get to the back end of the year. Operator : And there's no further questions in the queue. I'll turn the call back over to Mark for additional and closing remarks. Please go ahead. Mark Parrell : All right. Well, thank you all for your time on the call today and for your interest in Equity Residential. Good day. Operator : Everyone else has left the call. This concludes today's call.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Martin McKenna. Martin McKenna : Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's second quarter 2023 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer; Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer is here with us as well for the Q&A. Our earnings release is posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com.  Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Thank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our second quarter 2023 results. As we work our way through the leasing season, the business is performing well with same-store expenses now looking a little bit better than we thought leading us to lower our guidance for that item last night.  As a result of this, and lower expected interest expense, we are pleased to again raise our same-store net operating income and normalize funds from operations guidance after raising same-store NOI and NFFO guidance just two months ago based on better expected revenue results. In a moment, Michael Manelis will give you color on revenue drivers across our markets. After Michael\u2019s remarks, Bob will address the details of the improvement in our expense, and NFFO guidance, as well as our successful pending refinancing activity.  The overall theme here is that Equity Residential continues to benefit like most of the multifamily industry from solid demand, but with the more unique benefit of our mostly coastal portfolio being less exposed to the significant levels of supply just beginning to be delivered in the Sunbelt markets. We also continue to manage expenses well in an inflationary environment, which we expect will allow us to drive more dollars to the bottom-line than our competitors over time.  In terms of specifics, in the quarter, we continued to post strong same-store revenue results driven by good demand across our markets and rapidly improving delinquency in Southern California. As you may recall, we increased the midpoint of our same-store revenue guidance for the year at 5.875% in May, right before the NAREIT conference to reflect these factors.  That in turn caused an improvement of 100 basis points in our same-store NOI guidance midpoint and a $0.03 per share improvement in NFFO guidance at the midpoint. These continued strong operating results speak to the durable nature of our business in a phase of some pretty volatile economic conditions. Despite the layoff headlines, particularly in the tech sector that dominated the news in late 2022 and early 2023, we see substantial demand from our affluent renter demographic.  Also in places like Seattle, we are hopeful that the return to office mandates by employers like Amazon will drive incremental demand back into the urban areas of the city as commute times become intolerable for workers who dispersed far outside the city in response to COVID and are now required to be in the office frequently and as quality of life issues in these urban areas improve. And while new supply is certainly pressuring the Sunbelt and Denver markets as I mentioned before, we are seeing moderate levels of supply in most of our major markets. Even in Washington DC, where we are seeing the highest levels of competitive new supply is being absorbed at a good rate and the market is performing well.  Switching over to the transactions market, that market continues to be relatively quiet. We do not sell anything in a second quarter. We did buy a couple of deals including a newly developed property in lease up in Atlanta that I spoke about on our first quarter call. The other acquisition in the second quarter is a 287 unit property located in suburban Denver, which we purchased for approximately $108 million at an acquisition cap rate of 5%.  The transaction market generally remains stuck between buyers who expect lower prices, given the huge shift in interest rates and the less accommodative capital markets and sellers who remain wedded to early 2022 values and by and large have assets that are still operating pretty well. So they feel no great compulsion to sell right now.  Our sense, is that sales will pick up over the next 6 to 12 months and sellers accept the reality of rates being higher for longer as floating rate loans with expiring caps reset and as developer capital invested in newly completed development deals becomes impatient.  Now a quick note on our capital allocation strategy. As we've discussed with you for the past few years, we continue to have a goal of having a more balanced portfolio between urban and suburban and between Coastal and Sunbelt markets. We think such a portfolio will create the highest returns and lowest volatility over time. The recent issues caused by COVID in urban centers and the current issues in the Sunbelt markets due to supply, our examples of the opportunities and risks we wish to balance.  As opportunities present themselves in the Sunbelt and Denver markets and in select suburban, locations of our coastal markets to acquire or develop great assets at fair prices, we will be there to do so.  And before I turn it over to Michael, I want to take a moment to celebrate our 30 years as a public company. On August, 12th 1993 Equity Residential went public on the New York Stock Exchange. Much has happened in the past 30 years, We grew From about 21,000 units, and an initial valuation of $800 million in 1993 to more than 225,000 units across more than 50 markets at the peak leading to our 80,000 units and a value of more than $26 billion today.  On this journey, we acquired a number of other public apartment REITs, as well as some very large private portfolios including Archstone. At the head of this enterprise for all those years was our amazing Founder and Chairman, Sam Zell who we lost in May. Sam's guidance and influence are part of our DNA at Equity Residential and we will continue to run this company to honor his legacy of delivering superior long-term value to our shareholders. We thank all of you for your support over the past 30 years and for your kind words regarding Sam's passing.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael. Michael Manelis : Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This morning, I will review the second quarter 2023 operating performance in our markets. We continued to produce very solid results with same-store revenue growth of 5.5% in the second quarter that are in line with our improved May guidance expectations. Results are driven by a continuing improvement in delinquency, along with a continued healthy fundamentals in the business. As with last quarter, East Coast markets continue to outperform West Coast. Our results to-date reflect our view that we have previously shared with you that pricing trends will follow a normal, albeit slightly muted seasonal trajectory.  Generally, layoff announcement seem to have dissipated and our average resident remains in great financial shape with rent-to-income ratios during the quarter for new residents continuing to hover around 20%. Resident lease breaks and transfer activities to reduce rent often early indicators of resident economic stress remained below pre-pandemic levels and in line with seasonal expectations. The overall employment picture continues to be healthy and young adults are choosing the attractive lifestyles available in our markets. Single-family home purchases continue to be an expensive proposition. In fact, less than 8% of our residents gave bought home as the reason for their move out in the second quarter, which is well below the 12% norm for this period.  Combined this with the overall favorable competitive new supply position, we face in most of our markets and we are on track for a good year in 2023. As a reminder, a combination of more difficult, same-store revenue comparison periods, including the absence of governmental rental relief this year and a reversion to a more normal rent growth pattern will result in more moderate, but still above historical growth in the second half of 2023. As we sit here today in the back half of our primary leasing season, the portfolio is 96% occupied with good demand and resident retention. We expect a continued healthy trajectory for the remainder of the leasing season. Our portfolio-wide occupancy is being depressed by turnover in Southern California, primarily LA, as we work our way through the delinquency issues.  In the longer run replacing, these vacant units with paying residents outweighs the slightly lower short-term occupancy.  Now, let me spend a few minutes talking about market performance. So let's start with the East Coast. New York was by far the top performer for the second quarter with same-store residential revenue growth of more than 13%. We have very little competitive new supply in the market and our occupancy sits near 97%.  Demand indicators continue to be positive, making this market the expected top performer for the year Boston, produced slightly above 8%, same-store revenue growth in the second quarter, driven by strong demand across the sub-markets with our urban properties outperforming our suburban ones. We continue to hear stories of tough commute times for suburbanites that are resulting in residents coming back to the city. While new Supply in the market is above the five-year average, the large majority of it is not competitive with our assets and appears to be readily absorbed. Heading down to DC, this market continues to impress with same-store revenue growth of 6.3% in the second quarter, despite a high level of new supply across a number of sub-markets.  The market just keeps going, absorbing these units at a healthy pace and delivering some of the best revenue growth in the portfolio. As an example, Reverb, our new 312 unit development in Central DC, which is currently in lease up is delivering weekly application volumes well above expectations allowing us to reduce concessions and push rate.  Occupancy in the DC market is just below 97% and we are optimistic for continued strong performance for the year, but recognize the increased volume of new supply that will be delivered in the rest of this year. Now for the West Coast. Our Southern California markets achieved some of the strongest sequential revenue growth in the quarter demonstrating the early financial benefits of backfilling long-term delinquent units with paying residents. Unlike the Orange County and San Diego markets, which posted good quarter-over-quarter revenue growth, Los Angeles produced slightly negative quarter-over-quarter revenue growth.  This reported number however, is not indicative of the health of the market, but more noise from bad debt due to large rental relief receipts in the second quarter of 2022. When you strip this noise out, same-store quarter-over-quarter revenue growth would have been over 5% positive for LA. We are still seeing healthy demand in Los Angeles and have not felt any negative impact from the worker strikes in the entertainment industry.  Our direct exposure is not significant, but acknowledge it may soften overall market conditions in the coming months which could slow our ability to relieve some of our vacant units. In addition to the strike, we continue to see more non-paying residents move out, which is resulting in at least 100 basis point drag to occupancy in the market.  We view both of these issues as isolated short-term impacts to the market, as the strikes will end, and delinquency will gradually resolve itself, which coupled with the long-term demand we see as catalysts for next year above average market growth in LA.  Moving to San Francisco, a market reported respectable quarter-over-quarter revenue growth at 3.1%, which would have been 4.6% after adjusting for the impact of rental relief received in the second quarter of 2022. Overall, the San Francisco market demonstrated leasing velocity in line with normal seasonal trends, and met our expectations for the second quarter.  The South Bay, which represents 37% of our NOI in the market continues to be a bright spot. Prospects are telling our local teams that the area meets their hybrid work requirements by keeping them close for in office days and providing better lifestyle options and more space and access to the natural outdoor amenities.  Our recent resident survey tells us that 77% of our residents in the San Francisco Bay area are either hybrid or fully in office. In downtown San Francisco, we hear from our teams that new residents say that they are leasing to get closer to work. The good news is that the quality of life in downtown San Francisco continues to improve and the local government\u2019s focus seems to be showing some signs of promise.  While our pricing power in the sub-market remains less than desired and concessions are still being used. Downtown has been stable and allowed us to capture demand and regain occupancy to 96% in that sub-market. The overall sentiment in the San Francisco market indicates that the tech layoffs are mostly behind us, and there's a lot of momentum around AI, which keeps us optimistic on the continued recovery in this market.  Heading to Seattle, while there is vibrancy in the market with improvements in the quality of life issues, some return to office activity and tourism back to pre-pandemic level, the market continues to underperform our expectations. While net effective pricing in the overall market is now 2% below the March 2020 levels, there is a wide dispersion among sub-markets with the downtown Seattle well below the March 2020 levels, primarily due to the continued concession used in this sub-market.  Overall, Seattle has been a market that has struggled to deliver consistent strong demand over the last couple of years, as its tech-heavy workforce has had the flexibility to work from anywhere. But this market to fully recover, it needs to see more consistent, strong job growth with better quality of life conditions that will bring people back to the market.  The good news is that we are starting to see some positive signs in South Lake Union, which is a tech-heavy neighborhood in the City of Seattle, and this is likely due the Amazon return to office, which began in May. We are hopeful that this activity will soon spill over to the other downtown submarkets. Finally, in our expansion markets, which currently make up about 5% of our same-store NOI, revenue performance has been mostly in line with our acquisition performance and guidance expectations. Our portfolios in Denver, Dallas and Austin continued to be the most impacted by new supply like we discussed last quarter.  Meanwhile, Atlanta remains a bright spot with double-digit revenue growth for both the quarter and year-to-date. In a minute, I will turn it over to Bob to discuss our operating expense performance and the balance sheet. But let me take a minute to discuss our operating platform, which is humming as we continue to reap the benefits of our focus on innovation and the technology evolution at Equity. We are focused on the customer experience and the feedback we receive from our customers help us in developing our platform to drive superior financial performance and customer satisfaction. The insights we gained from our resident survey, which garnered more than 32,000 responses validates our strategy of combining our growing data science capabilities with streamlined execution, while delivering self-service solutions to our customers.  Leveraging data and analytics on top of our resident feedback will create further opportunities to expand our operating margin. With a fully centralized and mobile operating platform, we are in a strong position to create a seamless customer experience with a platform that continues to allow us to innovate, experiment, and rapidly scale what works across this portfolio.  I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to their residents and focus on delivering these terrific operating results. With that, I will turn the call over to Bob. Robert Garechana : Thanks, Michael. Let me start with expenses before covering our financing activities. We reported same-store expense growth of 5.5% in the quarter. The main drivers of this growth were repairs and maintenance and on-site payroll. Repairs and maintenance growth in the quarter was driven by continued wage pressure, particularly from contracted services.  Payroll growth was mostly due to elevated employee benefit cost during the quarter relative to the same period last year. Without these costs, reported payroll growth would have been 2.6%, which was more in line with our expectations and reflective of the efficiencies we have been achieving from our various operating initiatives.  For the full year, same-store expense guidance we have lowered the midpoint of our range by 25 basis, points to 4.25%. This reduction is driven by expectations of continued low real estate tax growth due to modest rate increases and successful appeals activity, as well as significantly lower expectations for commodity prices, which are muting utilities expense growth. These more favorable trends will be partially offset by slightly higher payroll and other onsite expenses stemming from the elevated employee benefit cost mentioned from Q2 and administrative costs from the expiration of the eviction moratoriums respectively. The revised guidance implies that significantly lower rate of growth for expenses during the second half of the year relative to our results through Q2.  We think that this is challenging, but definitely achievable given the easier comparable period from the back half of 2022 and the visibility we have into the items I just described.  Finally, turning to the capital markets and our 2023 refinancing activities. As we previously discussed, the company has an $800 million secured debt pool that matures in the middle of the fourth quarter. The debt originated from the Archstone transaction back in 2013, currently carries a rate of 4.21% percent and a portion of it needs to be refinanced in the secured market for tax reasons.  During Q2, we began marketing this opportunity to lenders and I'm happy to report we\u2019ve received significant interest from a variety of capital providers. In July, we selected lenders and entered into two loan commitments and locked in slightly below 5.25% rate for the $530 million that we're refinancing. This was approximately 135 basis points over the 10-year treasury at the time and was lower than what we would have expected to do had we been issuing an unsecured bond.  As you may recall, we've previously also entered into interest rate swaps to hedge this financing and those were settled for an over $25 million gain. When the gain is amortized over the life of the loan, it results in an economic cost for these financings of 4.7%, which we believe is an excellent outcome, given the environment.  Once these loans close, we would expect the company to end the year with approximately 8% floating rate debt, over $2 billion in immediately available liquidity and no real debt maturities outside of commercial paper until June of 2025. This, coupled with the lowest leverage in the company's history position us very well should any opportunities arise.  With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for question and answers. Operator : [Operator Instructions]  We'll go first to Eric Wolfe with Citi. Eric Wolfe : Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Looking at your guidance, there's a nice ramp in earnings in the back half of the year. Just curious if there's anything sort of more one-time or seasonal or non-recurring on the expense side there. And if I were to sort of just take that as runrate, is that sort of a good runway to think about going into 2024 or again is there something that sort of elevated? Robert Garechana : Hey Eric, it\u2019s Bob. So, looking at kind of our NFFO for Q3 and Q4, there's nothing really in particular that\u2019s a standout on a one-time item. It's really the cumulative growth in NOI that you're seeing in Q3 and then pushing that into Q4 coming from same-store. Drilling down a little bit into that, I would say the only thing from a sequential standpoint that is maybe a little bit abnormal is the bad debt component.  So we're seeing bad debt improve in the fourth quarter and in the third quarter sequentially as we get back to a normalization. So, beyond that there isn't really anything sequentially strange about the - or one-time in nature about the growth for runrate. As it relates to \u201924, I think it's a little early to talk about kind of \u201824, kind of where we are in terms of positioning. But what I would tell you is our numbers are kind of following that typical seasonal pattern that we've seen and same-store is really driving the operational results. Eric Wolfe : Understood. That\u2019s helpful. And then you mentioned LA in the writers strike, actors strike. It doesn't sound like it's really impacting bad debt or rent growth piece. It could impact a couple months. Just curious what that sort of based on and that's already factored into your guidance, as well. Michael Manelis : Hey, Eric, this is Michael. So, I think right now, of course we're watching to see is anybody turning keys in breaking leases at a pace that's kind of above, which you would expect to see. And we really just haven't seen any impact from the strikes and our onsite folks are telling us just the overall direct exposure to it. It doesn't seem to be significant.  I think my comments in the prepared remarks were, you know right now we clearly are running occupancy about 100 basis points below normal for this time of year in that LA market. So the ability to lease up some of these units that have been vacant which, were from the delinquent - long-term delinquent residents moving out earlier in the year than what we thought.  We just think that if the strike is prolonged and keeps going on, it could just create a little bit of a pause in people's willingness to make decisions to move - to move into a new place. And that could impact just the overall demand profile in the market. But today, really not seeing anything and I'm not overly concerned about it. But it is something we just got to be aware of it. Eric Wolfe : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to John Pawlowski with Green Street. John Pawlowski : Hey. Thanks for the time. My first question is on the transaction market. Alex, just curious what range of pricing do you think you could achieve on kind of large urban assets in the central business districts as San Fran, and Seattle today just given the sentiment in the market was still pretty, while maybe proven still pretty down. So just curious what type of bids for those types of assets is today? Alexander Brackenridge : Hi, yeah, John. This is Alex. Yeah, there would not be a robust bid today. Larger properties are harder to sell. There's some contrary in money out there. But I don't know if it's willing to make a big bet. So I really don't have an exact number because I just haven't seen a trade. I think most people if they didn't have to trade, just wouldn't be willing to accept the number. So, it's almost theoretical at this point.  I think over time, that'll change as the markets continue to improve and access to capital becomes more normal. It's just such an abnormally hard time to raise sizable capital that I really think it would be a tough time. It was a distressed sale via pretty high cap rate and maybe not indicative of what the more or less distressed owner would be willing to sell at. Mark Parrell : And John, it's Mark. Just to add to that, I mean, when you think about what supports apartment values there is certainly a lot of unallocated private capital. We've heard numbers up to $800 billion of private capital looking worldwide for real estate exposure. So, I think people, Chief investment officers, those kind of funds, just need to see some stability before they're willing to move.  I'm hopeful that towards the end of this year and early next, we'll be talking to you about some better numbers in those markets operationally. And I think that will also encourage capital flows. But I agree with Alex. I think it'd be really hard to peg a cap rate. It's almost like on a per unit per square foot basis, kind of conversation at the moment, but I think that's going to shift given the amount of capital on the sidelines and given our hope that operating results will improve over the next 12 months. John Pawlowski : Okay. That makes sense I guess, over the coming months or quarters when there is a little bit more on price discovery. Do you expect cap rates for these types of larger gateway trophy assets to be meaningfully higher than more suburban assets in what\u2019s kind of post-COVID environment? Mark Parrell : Well, what'd you run into is what ends up being a really compelling discount to replacement cost. So, I think people will start looking in that and realize that getting in at a good basis in one of these good - these good cities, it's just really compelling. So I just really think that'll be a floor and will prevent too much of a gap from arising. John Pawlowski : Okay. Final question, Mark, just longer term as you see these cities heal from COVID, what - and not meant to be precise, but rough order of magnitude, what's the right urban or suburban mix in the QR portfolio five years from now on this call? Mark Parrell : Great question. And what we've sort of thought about is we see ourselves as sort of 60% or so urban right now. And I get that number below 50 will probably be a goal. I think expanding into the Sunbelt markets, as you know, is a goal. And I think a great opportunity with the amount of product that's coming through. And I think in the suburban markets is some of our current coastal areas is a good idea too.  So my guess, John, is you'll see, sort of one-third of the portfolio in Denver and these Sunbelt markets five years from now. And you'll sort of see more of a 50-50 split urban, suburban. But we are a creature of opportunity.  And, if there was an opportunity to be to stay more urban because it was just absolutely compelling prices as Alec described, John, we'd certainly think hard about that. I mean, we're not - we feel like having a more balanced platform will give us better cash flow growth - more stable cash flow growth over time.  But you know the name of the game is buying right and if we can buy very well, we might move tactically for a while a different direction. John Pawlowski : Okay. Makes sense. Thanks for the time. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could maybe just talk about where you're sending out renewal notices. I know you provided some July data, but it looked like what is August and September look like and I guess, where do those discussions look like? And I guess, where are you seeing the most pressure on the new leases? Michael Manelis : Yeah. Hey Steve. This is Michael. So, for the renewal right now, you're right. We've got our quotes are out there for the next three months or so. It's been fairly consistent is what we've seen in the last couple of months. And right now based on conversations, we've been seeing through our centralized renewal team. We don't really expect to see a lot of variation. We think we're going to continue to renew about 55% to 60% of our residents and achieve right around, a 5% to 5.5% kind of achieved renewal rate growth, which incorporates a little bit more negotiation and typically what you see is as you get into the beginning of the peak leasing season, our centralized renewal teams we tightened up that negotiation range, thought to like 100 150 basis points on our quote.  Now what we expect to see is, we get in towards the tail end of the peak leasing season. Just to kind of drop that off a little bit and probably negotiate about 200 basis points off of the quotes that are out there. But again, I think we remain really optimistic about the performance centralizing this team has really given us the ability to kind of pivot quickly and really deliver consistent results.  In terms of the new lease pressure right now, I think if you would just look at some of the reported stats and you can see kind of in Seattle and San Francisco where you're still doing that concessions in those urban centers, that's definitely weighing in on some of our ability to have a new lease change kind of go positive. But again, I think overall, where we sit today in this leasing season, it's playing out kind of exactly like we thought where rents are sitting, where our new lease changes and the renewal performance and we just see kind of the markets reacting like they normally will through kind of the season. And that's kind of what's baked into the guidance that we have. Steve Sakwa : Great. And then, I guess, just on the development front I know you've got a handful of projects. I think one wholly-owned and several joint venture developments. Can you just remind us of kind of where those development yields are likely to pencil out? And I guess, Mark how are you thinking about the prospect of any future development?  If we're hearing correctly, merchant builders are starting to scale back their development teams. And hopefully over the next 18 months that development pipeline starts to shrink. But I guess, how are you thinking about that future pipeline freak you are? Mark Parrell : Hey, Steve, it's Mark, and Alec may join in a second. I mean, we've got a, it's good to have a solid internal team, which we have and good JV relationships with toll and others and we see all this stuff. But as Alec has said on prior calls, it's just not penciling out. There's not enough of a risk premium in what is a risky endeavor of development.  So, for us, I think acquisitions seemed like a better place to invest capital for the time being. I think what could change there is just some sense that, are the rents have moved a lot. I doubt costs are going to move down in any material regard, but I think right now, I like the development pipeline being smaller. In terms of the yields we\u2019re looking at, it\u2019s mid to high fives on our existing portfolio. The Laguna Clara deal in California, which is a one mile away from Apple headquarters deal was a little lower than that. It's an existing asset we\u2019re densifying. So there's less risk since we know the area so well. But beyond that, Steve, they're kind of high-five type of situations and to do a development deal, we need something to get into that close to that six range. And I don't - we may start a deal this year. We may not start anything we'll see. Steve Sakwa : Great. Thanks. That\u2019s it for me. Mark Parrell : Thanks Steve. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Josh Dennerlein : Yeah. Hey guys. Thanks for the time. Michael, in your opening remarks, you mentioned operating platform initiatives and I think you mentioned some margin expansion potential there. Any early thoughts on where the margins can ultimately go and maybe over what kind of time frame you are thinking? Michael Manelis : Yeah. Hey Josh. This is Michael. So maybe I'll just hit on overall kind of some of the initiatives in the innovations and I\u2019ll let Bob kind of touch base on the actual margins. So, I think what we put out in our May investor presentation really just kind of highlighted the initiatives that we have keyed up. And this year specific to 2023, we have about $10 million included in the NOI guidance with about two-thirds of that being on the expense front as we keep working through kind of the innovations of leveraging resources across assets.  And right now, we're really focused on kind of teeing up the next round of initiatives and it's really more income-based and probably other income-based items that will really kick into gear in the back half of this year and start delivering kind of results into 2024.  Right now, we are literally right on track with our numbers and we feel really confident and about the incremental $10 million for \u201923. And maybe Bob, if you just want to hit on the overall margin impact to that. Robert Garechana : Yeah. So, from a margin standpoint that will all be a accretive to margin. I guess, I would say that in the states we talk we all talk about very different margins. So I'm going to talk about the margin I guess, that I think is most important which is the cash flow margin, which we highlighted at the NAREIT Conference. So, cash flow margin meaning after CapEx after expense at all of that. We're already running at a league-leading level as it relates to that cash flow margin. And when you layer in the initiative, that Michael is talking about and that's inclusive of what you have to spend in order to achieve that that ROI and CapEx, etcetera, we think we can get a few percentage points of incremental increase there and that's what we're striving for. Josh Dennerlein : Okay. Appreciate that. And then, just the opening remarks on Seattle. It just seemed like it\u2019s the only legacy market you're facing with supply concerns. How long will it take to kind of work through that supply? Michael Manelis : Yeah, so Josh, this is Michael again. So right now, in Seattle, we\u2019re kind of actually in a low of going up against kind of head-to-head competitive supply. If you look at what's expected to be delivered and completed in \u201824, I think we're going to see that Seattle number kind of hinge up on us. And, it is something we're absolutely kind of watching and kind of making sure that those units will be delivered.  And when we create our guidance for \u201824, it's something that we will fold into that market. For us right now, Seattle, it's just been - it's kind of gets momentum and then it stalls a little bit. And then it gets momentum. So we really just haven't felt that consistent kind of strong job growth that's really needed to get us back on track and really get us out of that concessionary environment.  But to-date, it's not really the new supply that's been impacting us. Robert Garechana : Yeah, I just want to make a comment on Seattle. It's obviously for most of us pretty far away. So people aren't out there quite as much, but there's been an amazing renaissance in the city in terms of access to the waterfront. Very similar to the Big Dig in Boston. I think that's a very positive catalyst for quality of life in the downtown area where we have a lot of assets.  I do think there's an election coming up. There's been improvement in attitude in city government about livability and those issues. That's a positive. But I think Michael is, right. I think you're going to see a lot of supply, which on the one hand, Seattle is a market where actually the percent of rent to income is lowest with New York for us.  So there's an ability to pay more rent and there's a lot of high paying jobs and a lot of good industry in the Seattle metro area and has the city gets we hope more livable as people take advantage of these new Waterfront amenities. And I think, we feel good about Seattle and its ability to draw people in again, in scale and Amazon's just kind of called people back to the office.  So our folks on the ground say there is some momentum there in South Lake Union or Amazon has a lot of office workers. So we'll see where that takes this as well. But you asked a very narrow question. I'm giving you more. But I do have a sense of optimism about Seattle, but we have to navigate some of that supply the next really in \u201824 and \u201825 more than in \u201823. Josh Dennerlein : Appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Thank you. You described the strong backdrop in your markets and potentially some demand catalysts going forward. But if we just wanted to isolate July, it looks like the blended lease growth rates had decelerated versus June. And I'm wondering if you \u2013 if that surprise you as well or you know, potentially it seems like it would have peaked now, rather than picking a month ago. Michael Manelis : Yeah. Hey John, this is Michael. So, I mean, I'm going to touch on a few different things here. Let me - I'm going to start with kind of the rent first and then I'll address the new lease change relative to July. And I'll tell you just we went back and we looked at like the last 15 years of our data and our pricing trend which is that net effective price for our units.  It typically peaks out somewhere in that late August to - or late July to mid-August period. And really the first week of August is kind of that most common time frame. I tell you, we've had really strong foot traffic, strong application volume. So, I'm not going to be surprised that if we don't see a few more weeks of slight increases in rates, kind of coming through our system.  And that being said, I mean, right now this pricing trend is up about 6% since the beginning of the year and it's right where we thought it was going to be. So even if we just peaked out at this level right now, it's kind of right in line and we will be just buying in terms of its flowing through the other stats. In terms of that deceleration of new lease change, I'd start by saying I would not read too much into any single month as this stat it's really better to look at over time. And I think that what you saw in our release, it was like a ten basis point different. That's just a lot of noise for maybe who moved out and versus who moved in and where that was being done. And right now, I'll say that the new lease changes being more impacted by that concession used in the urban centers of Seattle and San Francisco.  But again, I think as we turn the corner and we looking at August I wouldn't be surprised if those not inch back up a little bit. We're really in this tight band relative to our expectations about new lease renewals and how that kind of translates into that blended new lease or the blended rate. So, I wouldn't read too much into any one month stat. John Kim : Okay. Thanks for the color. On the secured debt that you raised at 472, it looks like your unsecured notes with the similar term trades around 50 basis points above that. How does that spread \u2013 is secured is unsecured? How is that 50 basis points compared to historical? And if this continues with the secured market look more attractive to you going forward. Robert Garechana : Yeah, so let me break down - hey John. It's Bob. Let me break down a couple pieces. When you're comparing the 472, what I'm guessing you're comparing to where our unsecured are trading today. What you're incorporating in that is the impact of the hedges, right? So in my prepared remarks, I mentioned that we - when we issue the secure, we haven\u2019t issued it. But when we lock rate on the secured loan, we are at a 135 basis points on the treasury at that time, which was, call it 5.25. How you get the 470 as you apply the gain that we got, because we give some forward, starting swaps at really attractive rates and that reduced it to 470. So what we should compare is really the spread that 135 basis points that I talked about in my prepared remarks to where the spread that would be implied in our unsecured.  And that's a lot more narrow. That's probably five to ten basis points hit or miss between either one. So they're relatively on top of each other. We think maybe we're, maybe five basis points inside on secured. But that's, one day's worth of trading activity could flip you and you be a parody. John Kim : Great. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Jamie Feldman : Great. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping you can dig a little deeper into DC across the different sub-market. It seems, I could tell that pretty well, but there's also a decent amount of supply. So kind of what's your outlook for the back half of the year and into \u201824 in that market? Mark Parrell : Yeah. So what's amazing about DC and even when you drill in by submarket, you really don't see a huge differential in our performance. And I think part of that is just when we talked about new supply coming into that market. They got such a great transit environment there that supply really in any one of these sub markets can pull from other areas. So we really haven't seen any deviation of the performance across the submarkets. Now, when you look forward to the balance of the year, like it was back half loaded for deliveries. So we are aware that we're going to be facing more and more competitive supply. And it is fairly dispersed across some of these submarkets. But again I don't think we're forecasting to have like more pressure in one submarket than the other, because of that transit environment that could pull from everywhere.  The outlook for the balance of the year, it's still good, right? We're producing really strong revenue growth. Good absorption of the supply. It may soften up a little bit, but I think we still have this momentum coming in and I think it's positioned well for \u201824, even though you got another round of supply coming at you again. It\u2019s a market that's been demonstrating resilience and stability. Jamie Feldman : And there\u2019s been a lot of talk around the government not bringing certain agencies back to the office. Is that something that you \u2013 that\u2019s kind of contemplated in the stats you are seeing already? Maybe those aren't really tenants that you see in your buildings or do you think that\u2019s a potential drag to comps? Michael Manelis : Well, it's Mark, and Michael may add to this. I mean, through the real estate roundtable, there\u2019s been a lot of advocacy around that of trying to get federal workers back on the job. I'm hopeful that it continues to push the administration put something out. It wasn't very strong on that topic. But we'll continue to push for that. I mean the federal government is such the key employer, of course, in the metro, I mean implicitly in our guidance is not much of a change in the current reality on the ground getting all those folks back in the office would be helpful. And I remind you there is a difference between the type of employee. If you're in the National Security world, you've likely been at the office the whole time and as that group grows, there need to be closer in and closer into their office will continue to be relatively high. Again I'm hopeful that we get - there's been some action in Congress by the way, some bills introduced to get federal workers back in the office.  So, I'm hopeful that that's a positive, but it isn't an income, it's not inside of our guidance that we expect improvement. It's just a hope we have both frankly as taxpayers and as owners of real estate in DC. Jamie Feldman : Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful. And then, I guess a similar question across the markets in Seattle where you know, so far this cycle we've seen major differences depending on where in the market assets are located or even diverse today. What are your thoughts there? And what do you think the implications are? Transit matters much or how should we be thinking about your outlook there? Mark Parrell : I mean, for us, right now, it's really like Belltown CBD is where you see the pressure, where you see the prices that are still materially off from where they were in March of 2020. The suburbs there feel good right? It's not like great and robust, but they are healthy. So it's really just a suburban versus urban kind of differential that we see across that Seattle market. And when you think about the supply that's coming, it will impact not only urban but also the suburban areas, as well for next year in that market. Jamie Feldman : Okay. Alright. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Haendel St. Juste : Hey there. Good morning. Why don't you go back to the West Coast markets for a bit? I was curious, if you could give us a bit more color on what you are seeing in terms of concessions maybe between San Fran, Seattle, and parts of LA? And then, at a high level, what are your blended rate growth expectations for the West Coast versus East Coast markets in the back half of the year? Thanks. Michael Manelis : Hey, Haendel, this is Michael. So let me just \u2013 I\u2019ll start with just the overall kind of concession used in the portfolio. Fairly consistent in the second quarter versus kind of the first quarter. Overall, we're running about 15% of the applications are receiving just about a month. About 80% of all the concessions that are being used are concentrated in the urban centers of both Seattle and San Francisco.  In downtown San Francisco, it's about 50% of the applications are receiving about six weeks and in downtown Seattle, it's about a third of the applications that are receiving just over a month. In terms of the spreads in the West Coast markets for new lease change, I don't know if I have that kind of handy.  I will tell you that right now the East Coast markets have been outperforming the West Coast by about 400 basis points. My guess is that spread is going to stay fairly consistent although you definitely have some movement in LA with some of the changes happening with bad debt. Haendel St. Juste : That's helpful. Thank you. And where's the loss to lease in the portfolio today? And where is it highest and where is it lowest? Robert Garechana : Sure. So right now, the loss to lease at 3.7% which, for this time of the year is actually a little bit stronger than what we have seen historically. And maybe rather than like going by market around loss to lease, I could just kind of cluster them for you and group a few by a range. So like New York and San Diego, have the highest loss to lease right now, which has been running about 9%.  And then that's followed by like DC, Orange County, Boston are all very tightly clustered in this like 4.5% to 6% range. And then, you go to like the Denvers, the San Francisco, Seattles and LA, those are all in like the flat to 2%. And then I have my expansion markets of Dallas and Austin are the two markets right now they're in a gain to lease.  I think when you put all of this into the blender knowing where pricing trend is today, like I said, with that 6% growth from the beginning of the year, sitting with the 3 7 loss to lease which is above kind of a normal year. It really does put us in a great position not only to finish out the year, but to have a starting point for \u201824, that's really above a norm. Haendel St. Juste : Got it. Very helpful color. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good morning and happy 30th anniversary. So two questions on both actually around acquisitions. So, Mark, Sam used to talk about trading sardines and eating sardines. As you guys look at your experience in the - in the - especially in the urban markets, the bigger assets, do you see those assets in EQR going forward? Do you see them more as trading sardines or eating ones? Mark Parrell : Interesting. I love that analogy out for a historical reference point. I mean, these - some of the markets like New York, if you want a presence in Midtown, the assets by definition are mostly large and costly, all right?  So, it's more of a market than a type decision, I would say, I think it's more likely that you'd see us sell a large asset, because we just want to lower our market exposure there, not because we're particularly allergic to a large asset in the market if it's not performed well or if we have an over concentration in a submarket, you'll see us sell it.  So, I guess, I don't know what to do with that analogy in a sense that larger assets are harder to sell. We generally operate in pretty efficiently. We generally can run capital pretty efficiently to make up for that. But I don't have a sardine type description for you. Except to say that I think we\u2019d sell if we don't like the spot, big or small asset. Alexander Goldfarb : Wait, I guess what I'm saying, what I'm getting at is given the volatility that we've seen in the urban markets, do you think that it's better for EQR going forward to be more nimble. And say, look, we have a base of assets that we like more in the suburbs where it's harder to get in, harder to get out in the cities where, you'll go up to a peak, where you have record rents.  And it's easier to sell and then sort of trade around. That's what I'm trying to get at. If the urban markets are more like trading markets versus long-term markets, so you're always trying to sort of arbitrage exposure. Mark Parrell : Yeah, I guess, I don't, I don't agree with that. I'd start off by saying, volatility in all sorts of assets and you're about to see volatility in the Sunbelt markets with these kind of prices. The fact that they're smaller assets just means that the price has just declined. I mean, the way to protect against volatility in the markets that to be in a position with your balance sheet and your strategy, we are not a compelled seller.  So, for us, volatility can mean opportunity, right? If prices go down enough, as I mentioned in my remarks, in even in San Francisco, we'd be a buyer. So, I just want to make that clear. For us about volatility is opportunity, not always a negative. And the way we protect ourselves is by having a broader platform. So I think one of the lessons we learned over the last 10-15 years is a broader platform means you can act more quickly and more markets and take advantage of those volatile moments where, Austin, Texas trades cheap to long-term value and you are a buyer there or New York trades cheap and you're a buyer there.  So, I think as you see us balance the platform out, you're going to see us be more - even more opportunistic. And I wouldn't shy away from buying a large asset. I think you just got to go with your eyes wide open about those assets being harder to sell. And there is something you\u2019d add Alec? Alexander Brackenridge : Yeah. Alex, this is Alec. And I would just add that take Manhattan or actually Boston and DC relate any of our urban markets to reproduce those portfolios would be virtually impossible. I mean, Manhattan, I don't know how you'd find \u201825, really well located assets in any amount of time. So we've got an unusual opportunity that we're taking advantage of today and you're seeing in Manhattan it\u2019s the best performing market in the country. And you just couldn't decide all of a sudden you wanted to reproduce that. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then, the second question is, given it's a competitive market for transactions we saw one of your peers duo two large transactions that are basically neutral initially. Are there ways for you guys to enhance your initial yield be it like, buying in the in the further the mass positions or junior positions? Or are there other ways that you can enhance your yields. So that when you do close on a deal, it's more accretive than often it seems like, in REIT lands, a transaction ends up being neutral year one and it's not until year two or three that we start to see the benefits. Mark Parrell : Yeah, I'm going to split this up a little bit for the team to answer. I think I want to start by Alec talk about cap rate certainly matters a ton. But we also think a lot about replacement cost and I'm going to ask Michael or Bob to just talk about platform scaling, margin expansion at EQR, those kinds of things Alex that can affect year two yields. So, why don\u2019t Alec? Alexander Brackenridge : Yeah, so this is Alec. What we're really focusing is a very targeted buyer right now and what we're targeting our opportunities whereas Mark says, there's a discount to replacement cost but also a limited supply pipeline. So that typically has been out in the suburbs. And those kinds of base - if you get in at a good basis like that, that's the best thing for your investment in the long run rather than some kind of mezz fees - that might be a little bit of financial engineering, getting it to a good basis it's just be irreplaceable. Mark Parrell : Yeah, and I think from the operator\u2019s standpoint, I think we have worked really hard over the last couple of years to build a platform that is highly scalable. So, when we go into these markets, we're looking really at the ability to kind of leverage staff across properties, put them onto our platform, kind of put them into our pricing system and it's clearly accretive from an operating margin for us when we're looking at underwriting these deals. Right now, when we look across these markets, any of the acquisitions we're looking at, we're saying even in our existing markets, what benefits do we get by bringing this into that portfolio? Whether that\u2019s at a submarket level or the market as a whole. Michael Manelis : Yeah, and I just think, you've asked some, some great questions, Alex. I mean, we're in a really good position where we've got teams in the markets. We can underwrite quickly. We can take over management quickly. But we're not over exposed to the supply. And there's going to be a lot that's going to be sold in the Sunbelt markets.  And I think you should think not just about us selling some of these legacy urban assets and affecting I'll call it the numerator, but that's making the company net bigger, likely by using some of our debt capacity that Bob and his team have created so capably over the last few years to go out there and be a net buyer.  And I think what's more important the management team and the Board is that, per pound replacement cost discount. I think we're looking for the deals to make sense on an initial cap rate basis, as well. But I mean, the most important thing, most important signal to us historically has been buying at a meaningful discount to replication cost and in an environment where construction costs are high and they may be flat for a year or so, but they're likely not going to decline in our opinion much.  You can get a discount to basis. You got a little moat around your asset. I like everything about that. So I think that's what you'll hear us talk about if we're fortunate to see some assets out there to buy in these expansion markets and in the suburbs of our existing markets. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you. Michael Manelis : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Michael Goldsmith : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. My first question is on bad debt. Can you provide some context in terms of what's included or implied that happens to bad debt in the back half of the year in your updated guidance? Thanks. Robert Garechana : Yeah. So, good question, Michael. It's Bob. So in the back half of the year, we will actually finally switch to bad debt helping with the growth rate by about 30 basis points and the reason is because, we continue to see that sequential improvement of bad debt and we will cross over the difficult comparable period, that relates to the rental relief payments at in the prior year. That accretion or that benefit to total revenue growth is likely not going to occur until the fourth quarter, because in the third quarter of 2022, you still had elevated rental relief, but we think we will cross over there. We think at the, by the end of the year, when you look at the full year basis, we will end the year around, call, it 125, 130 basis points as a percentage of total revenue and bad debt, which is still elevated relative to the historical norm of 50 basis points and leaves opportunity for more contribution to growth as you go into 2024. Michael Goldsmith : Got it. Thanks for that. And my second question is more of a strategic question. Arguably, you have one of, if not the best position portfolios for the market right now, given the strength in coastal urban areas. And then we consistently are being told that, you're looking to have a more balanced portfolio between urban and suburban coastal and Sunbelt.  So, could you just talked a little bit about - like, how should investors reconcile kind of the strength of the portfolio, now to kind of the overall strategy of diversifying away from what's working right now? Thank you. Mark Parrell : Yeah. Great. Great question. Very fair. I think you're going to see the baton kind of pass. I think for a few years, these Sunbelt markets are going to be pretty stressed. And I think a lot of the owners of these assets aren't long-term owners. They\u2019re developers with impatient capital, expensive development debt and we can buy those properties again for a good basis as we just discussed. And add them to the portfolio.  I think our kind of resident is increasingly in some of these Sunbelt markets. But yet the Coastal markets, have real supply advantages that you're seeing right now. So creating a real balanced portfolio for our investors, I think for the next year or so, they're going to benefit from just better coastal dynamics on the supply and demand side.  I think after a while those things will even out, and I think they have a portfolio that year-in and year-out outperforms, not just in certain periods, but year in and year out. It just requires more balance between urban and suburban and coastal and Sunbelt. And we're really balancing the demand and supply, risks, and opportunities.  We\u2019re thinking a lot about regulatory risk. And we're thinking a bunch about resilience. The cost for example of insurance in Florida. The cost of casualty and repairs and things like that are getting more significant. So, I think as we talk to our investors and I think this has been well received and the instruction we\u2019ve received from the Board is to again, try and create this portfolio that's a little more balanced as to opportunities and risks.  And I think what our investors will get are hopefully league-leading numbers for the next, I don't know how many quarters, 18 months to 24 months. And then, hopefully, at some point we'll start to see supply abate and these other new markets and we'll be there to take advantage of that having purchased at an attractive basis. So, in my hopes and dreams, that's how it would play out. Michael Goldsmith : Thank you very much. Good luck in the back half. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Adam Kramer : Yes. I think you've done a really good job of kind of presenting pricing trends on a kind of a seasonal or sequential basis historically. Thinking about 5.24 in your most recent deck for example. Just wondering, thinking about kind of the, the late summer months and into the fall, maybe just walk us through your assumptions for kind of growth relative to the normal seasonal pattern? Michael Manelis : Hey Adam, this is Michael. So, I think what we've said is, we expected this year to follow normal seasonal rent, both on a rent seasonality, demand seasonality. And right now and we said it was going to be a little bit muted.  We didn't expect rents to peak quite as high as what they would normally peak. Right now, we're doing kind of right where we thought we would be, turning the corner, heading into August, we would expect just given the application volume and the foot traffic we're seeing that we've got several weeks left of what I would say is the peak leasing season where we'll continue to inch up a little bit of rate.  And then, as you turn the corner and you walk your way in through September, we do expect that rates will start to moderate a little bit. We have so many years of data. We're looking at all of these stats and we haven't really seen anything that tells us not to expense - not to expect that normal kind of softening that occurs in the late third quarter, and into the fourth quarter, both from the pricing trend standpoint, little bit on the occupancy standpoint, but right now, we feel pretty good because of the Southern California situation that occupancy will continue to improve and be stable for us for the year.  So I just think you just got to look through all of those stats and just put yourself into a bell curve and allow both rent seasonality and demand seasonality to kind of tail off in the third late third quarter and fourth quarter. That's what we're modeling. We've seen years clearly, where we've been able to defy that and hold the line with rate or have good demand kind of going all the way through the fourth quarter. I just don't have any insight right now to say that this is going to be the year that does that. Adam Kramer : That's super helpful. Really appreciate that color. And then, I guess, just frankly a kind of a similar question, but thinking about back earlier in the year, I think you guys put out a kind of 2.5% market rent growth forecast for the full year. Wondering if it you know if this point in the year kind of knowing what you know you have the half year results in so far. Would you make any kind of changes to that number? Or is that kind of still how you are thinking about for the full year on average 2.5% market rent growth? Michael Manelis : So, Adam, this is Michael again. No, I think we're like, we're running right at it, like we're right on top of these numbers. I think that market rate growth, you layer on top of where our embedded growth was in the beginning of the year, our ability to capture the loss to lease. And then you had that intra period growth.  You put all of that stuff into the blender together and it was pointing us to this like 4% blended rate growth for the year? And right now, that's like exactly where we're headed. So, I wouldn't change that number outlook at all. Adam Kramer : Thanks so much for the time. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s question and answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mark Parrell. Please go ahead. Mark Parrell : Thanks, Roots. Thank you all for your time and interest in Equity Residential today.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Please go ahead. Martin McKenna : Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's third quarter 2023 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; and Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer. Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer; and Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, are here with us as well for the Q&A. Our earnings release is posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com as is a management presentation for the quarterly call. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.  Now I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Thank you, Martin. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2023 results. As you can see from the press release and management presentation, the business continues to do well in most of our markets, with our East Coast markets outperforming our West Coast markets. New York, Boston and Washington, D.C., comprising a bit more than 40% of our net operating income are all having very good years and are meeting or exceeding our expectations. Our target renter demographic remains well employed. Unemployment for the college educated is at 2.1%, with increasing pay levels and a continuing high propensity to rent, given elevated single-family ownership costs, low for-sale inventory and lifestyle reasons like delayed marriage and smaller families that favor our business. We're also seeing lower levels of new apartment construction in most of our established markets where we have 95% of our net operating income versus the Sunbelt markets, a pattern that will continue for the next several years. Consistent with this view throughout the primary leasing season, our pricing followed a trajectory that was pretty typical for a normal pre-COVID year. And as you can see in the management presentation, on par with our guidance assumption, the normal rent seasonality would return in 2023. We saw our portfolio-wide rents peak in early August and then begin to decelerate as we expected. However, we recently saw a deceleration in pricing in San Francisco and Seattle that was more pronounced than usual seasonal patterns. The main culprit here seems to be a lack of job growth for our target renter demographic. Michael will have more detail on this as well as the building blocks for 2024 that are laid out in the management presentation in a moment. In Los Angeles, we are working through the impact of a drawn-out process to normalize delinquency levels and to reduce bad debt. We continue to make good progress here, portfolio-wide bad debt before application of rental relief funds in the third quarter was about 1.3% as compared to 2.4% in 2022. But the process is uneven, and it is lengthy. Evictions are now taking six months or more in Los Angeles versus the two months to three months prior to the pandemic. Given the underperformance in San Francisco and Seattle and the lumpiness and improvement in bad debt as well as the impact from the noncash write-off of a $1.5 million straight-line rent receivable in the quarter due to the bankruptcy of Rite Aid, which is a retail tenant of ours, we have adjusted our same-store revenue guidance expectation for the year to 5.5% from 5.875% at the previous midpoint. We have also adjusted our EPS, FFO, and NFFO guidance accordingly. Turning to 2024, the long-term health and outlook of our business remains positive, with favorable tailwinds that should support performance. While job growth expectations for 2024 are lower than 2023 levels, we'll continue to benefit from demand from a well-employed resident demographic, we think are going to rent with us longer, given the cost of single-family ownership and powerful social trends like delayed marriage and smaller families that I previously mentioned. We also see a significant benefit from lower deliveries of new supply in our established markets compared to the elevated deliveries in the Sunbelt markets over the next few years. Switching to capital allocation. While the overall market remains quiet, we did have some activity in the quarter. We sold a 30-year-old asset in downtown Seattle during the quarter at a 5.4% disposition yield as we continue to lighten the load in the urban centers of our West Coast markets. We also continued to invest in our expansion markets by acquiring two assets in suburban Atlanta. One property was built in 2019 and was acquired from a large private equity real estate player. The transaction is a 5.1% acquisition cap rate, including the impact of the mark-to-market on some low-cost debt that we assumed as part of this transaction. This property is located in an upscale mixed-use development, though we acquired none of the retail with a resident base having high-paying jobs at the large education, and medical employers nearby. The other asset we acquired is in Gwinnett County, with easy access to the I-85 employment corridor, and was acquired for $98 million. This asset is brand new and is still in lease-up, and we expect it will stabilize at a 5.4%-year two acquisition cap rate. The median home price in the desirable area where the property sits is $600,000 which assuming a normal down payment in current interest rates equates to an all-in housing cost at 2.5 times our pro forma rents. Median household incomes in the area and among our residents at the property are around $100,000, making rentership a good financial and quality of life decision. It is important to note that our 2023 acquisition activity was paid forward capital from our asset sales without incurring any dilution as we took a cautious approach to transaction activity given the pricing uncertainty and low volumes in the marketplace. We sold properties that averaged 30 years old, and that we expect will have more capital needs and lower go-forward IRRs than the properties that were acquired, which were one year old on average. We are well positioned to further our portfolio diversification by taking advantage of acquisition opportunities that we believe are likely to arise from the substantial development pipeline that is delivering in our expansion markets over the next two years.  And now I'll turn the call over to Michael Manelis. Michael Manelis : Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This morning, I will review the third quarter 2023 operating performance in our markets, our outlook for the remainder of the year, and some views into 2024, and that we included in our management presentation. We continue to produce very good results with residential same-store revenue growth of 4.4% in the third quarter driven by generally healthy fundamentals in our business and some improvement in delinquency, although not as much as we expected. The East Coast markets continue to outperform the West Coast. Demand and occupancy remain healthy, especially across our East Coast markets and absorption and our results in the Washington, D.C. market continue to impress. As I will discuss shortly, San Francisco and Seattle are experiencing more pricing pressure than we previously expected. Before I get to that, let me touch upon October leasing spreads, new lease, renewal and blended. The stats we published through October 27 captures almost all the months activity, and as we mentioned, are consistent with seasonal declines outside of Seattle and San Francisco. New lease change is negative, which is normal for the month, and will continue to get more negative as pricing trend, which is presented on Page 6 of the management presentation, continues to decline for the balance of the year. In a normal pre-pandemic year, by the time you get to December, it is not uncommon to see new lease change be negative 4% or 5%. Given the weakness in our Seattle and San Francisco portfolios, we will likely be slightly more negative than that. Renewal rate achieved should moderate slightly, but remain relatively stable and make up more of the transaction mix. Put it all in the blender and Q4 blended rate will continue to moderate. In terms of the specific conditions on the ground in San Francisco and Seattle, as we stated previously, we have had little to no pricing power throughout the year. However, the peak leasing season did demonstrate an increased volume of demand and some moderation of concession use, which led us to what we initially thought could be the beginning of better stability. Over the last six weeks, however, these markets have slowed more than normal, which has resulted in larger price reductions than seasonally expected, characterized by both declining rates and increased concession use. This is most pronounced in the downtown areas of both markets, though there are other suburban pockets experiencing pressure like Downtown Redmond in Seattle. The uncertainty of back to the office from the big tech employers, combined with their slowdown in new hiring is keeping a lid on demand. In order for these markets to fully recover, we will need to see the vibrancy that comes to these areas when the offices are active, employment increases, and residents want to enjoy the city lifestyle and easy commute to the office. Both cities are making progress on improving the quality of life issues, and we are seeing signs that a few of the major tech employers are slowly adding positions back, especially in Seattle, but the improvement in both of these areas need to accelerate in order to generate enough in migration to these markets, which will allow pricing power to return. While recognizing challenges in these two markets, overall, our business remains healthy. Even with these now muted expectations, 2023 is on track to deliver very strong same-store revenue growth with several positive trends that we expect to continue into 2024 and support our business. First, our residents remain in good shape financially with rent-to-income ratios remaining at 20% portfolio-wide. Resident lease breaks and transfer activities to reduce rent, often early indicators of resident economic stress remain below pre-pandemic levels and in line with seasonal expectations. Overall, the job market and our residents remain resilient, which would expect -- which we expect to carry into 2024. Our resident retention remains very good. Turnover in the portfolio remains some of the lowest that we have seen. Single-family home purchases continue to be an expensive housing alternative, especially in our established markets. In fact, only 7.5% of our residents who moved out, bought home as the reason in the third quarter which is one of the lowest numbers we have seen since we started tracking the data back in 2006. At this point, we are not seeing anything to suggest that the overall turnover rate in the portfolio will not remain low. As I mentioned earlier on the demand side, generally, the employment picture, particularly for the college educated, remain solid and supportive of continuing demand into 2024. So, as I already noted, the high-quality job creation machine in San Francisco and Seattle recently paused, but longer-term fundamentals support the potential future growth. On the supply side, overall, we are favorably positioned, particularly compared to those concentrated in the Sunbelt. We should benefit from less direct competitive supply pressure in most of our established markets while DC will be about the same and Seattle will have elevated supply in 2024. When looking at new supply as a percent of inventory, there are significant differences between the overall Sunbelt and our expansion markets -- as compared to our established markets. The average new supply as a percent of total inventory in our established markets is around 2%, which includes the Seattle market at 4.5% which is the only outlier both on an absolute percent basis and relative to historical norms. Meanwhile, the Sunbelt markets are forecasted at just around 6% and our expansion markets range between a low 4% in Atlanta and a high of nearly 10% in Austin, which will result in pronounced supply pressure. This shouldn't be overly impactful for us since only 5% of our NOI is located in these expansion markets and, in fact, may present acquisition opportunities for us as financially stressed developers sell properties. So, putting all of these factors together, our overall revenue outlook for 2024 right now anticipate solid growth led by the East Coast markets. As you can see in the management presentation, our embedded growth going into next year is trending slightly above pre-pandemic norms and loss to lease is generally in line. With bad debt net, it is hard to predict the exact amount of tailwind from improvement, but our view is that we will continue to gradually work our way back towards pre-pandemic levels. The eviction process is taking twice as long as it did pre-pandemic, and this speed is not yet sufficient to both clear the backlog and allow for new typical volume of evictions to be processed. That said, we see no decline in the credit quality of our resident and their propensity to pay. We continue to believe that we will see meaningful improvement in 2024. In addition to the tailwind from bad debt net, we expect to see some incremental lift from several of the operating initiatives that we have in place around renewals, parking, connectivity, and other income opportunities. Moving to expenses, which continued to trend in line, we would expect our 2024 same-store expense growth to be slightly below this year. We will feel continued pressure on the repair and maintenance lines with some of the new technology fees like Smart Home and Wi-Fi, although the comp period from 2023 is pretty high, so that will help offset some of that growth rate. Insurance is clearly in for another significant increase. And right now, we expect real estate taxes to be higher than this year, but nothing that will create too much overall pressure. Some of the growth in these expense categories will be mitigated by continued operating efficiencies in the payroll line being created from our centralization initiatives. Let me wrap up by saying that the apartment business continues to be good with favorable demographics driving demand and limited new supply in most of our markets. We will continue to enhance our operating platform to take advantage of the opportunities that the markets present while delivering a seamless customer experience to our residents. I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to their residents and focus on delivering these results.  With that, I will turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we'll go first to Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning. Michael, I was just wondering if you could expound a little bit on the October numbers on the new side. If you do sort of the -- I guess the implied change, if you stripped out Seattle and San Francisco, the number was only down 30 bps, but that kind of implies that those markets were down kind of high single digits to almost 10% in October which is sort of like a month-free or rents are down with some concessions. Are we thinking about that right? And I guess, just trying to figure out what really turned the market to be that south. And it sounds like it's really in the urban core as opposed to less in the suburban communities? Michael Manelis : Steve, this is Michael. So yes, you are thinking about it correct. When you look at the October new lease spreads and you drill into Seattle, San Francisco, and I kind of put the expansion markets in there as well, they are running in the new lease change rate in the high negative single digits. If you drilled into San Francisco and Seattle, I'll tell you about 400 basis points of that is driven from the increased concession use. So, you can almost look at that negative 8%, negative 9%, split it in half, and say half is from increased concession use. The other half is from rate.  Some of that rate decline is really a function of who moved out, when did they move in, but the rates are down about 2%, 2.5% in those markets on a year-over-year basis. And if we drilled in even deeper into there, it is heavily concentrated into those urban cores of both Seattle and San Francisco. But as I said in the prepared remarks, the suburbs aren't completely immune from it. When you went around San Francisco, we are using some concessions on the East Bay concentrated in Alameda. But when you look at the value of the concessions, we're up at like six weeks, call it, 55% of the applications receiving six weeks in Seattle and San Francisco, which is very different than what you see in the suburbs, which are running less than a month. Steve Sakwa : Great. And then just maybe a follow-up on the transaction market. Mark, you sort of talked about maybe starting to see some increased activity, particularly in the Sunbelt. I'm just curious where that transaction market is? Where is the bid ask? I know you're sort of maybe a little bit indifferent on cap rates based on where you can sell. But just how are you thinking about pricing? And how have you may be changed your underwriting? Alexander Brackenridge : Steve, it's Alex. So, it seemed like over the summer, things were settling down to, say, 5.25%, maybe even a 5.5% cap. The last 60 days have changed that a lot. With the spike in the tenure, it's really uncertain what the market is doing right now. So, you hear about transactions closing, but those reflect pricing from the summer, not from right now. So, we're all feeling it out. So, there are properties -- limited number of properties on the market. No one knows exactly what cap rate reflects what the seller is willing to give up and what a buyer thinks is appropriate returns. So, it's definitely upward pressure on cap rates. We're pricing things all the time. As we've talked about on past calls, we look hard at replacement costs, and there might be compelling activity.  And we just think there's going to be more and more pressure to sell over time where people are going to have to accept a new reality, particularly in these high supply markets, particularly people have exposure to caps or debt that's maturing and that there'll be more activity as the market kind of settles down over the next six months to nine months or so. Steve Sakwa : Great. Thanks. That's it for me. Operator : We'll go next to Eric Wolfe with Citi. Eric Wolfe : Thanks. On your bad debt, if the court process had been as quick as you thought, I guess how much more would have bad debt been down from the current 1.27%? And once you're through with the bulk of evictions and court proceedings, where would that take a bad debt? Robert Garechana : Yes. Eric, it's Bob. So, had it kind of progressed as fast as what we would have thought instead of having, call it, a 1.27% in the third quarter, we probably would have been about 10 basis points ahead of that and would have trended closer? So, the trajectory that we were hopeful that we were going to get to. And what we're just seeing, as Mark mentioned and Michael also mentioned in their prepared remarks is that it's just taking longer, right? And so, as the residents are staying longer with us as they go through the process, we're incurring more bad debt overall. We do have excellent transparency and excellent visibility into who's where in the cycle. So, who's where in terms of where they are in court cases, who's awaiting lockouts and all of that stuff, but we don't have great visibility into when exactly those proceedings are going to occur. As Michael mentioned in his prepared remarks, going forward, we do expect that at some point, this will accelerate because the backlog from the pandemic era will be worked through, and that we, at some point, will be able to get back to that 50 basis points, particularly given the fact that the credit quality of our customer hasn't changed, but it's harder to swag where we're going to end up on a full year basis. Mark Parrell : And Eric, it's Mark. Just to add to that. We certainly hope 50 basis points is where we end up. But I would say that the fact that in some of these markets, the process has been maybe more permanently elongated because of either right to counsel and funded rights to counsel in some of our markets and just general, more bureaucratic effort required to get through it, you may have folks, and that's what Michael was alluding to in his remarks, we aren't seeing more delinquency with our new residents. We're seeing what I'll call the normal amount. But usually, they'd be out in a month or two.  And now it's just taking longer, and that means they're going to hit our bad debt reserve. They're still leaving. But I just think again, we feel like the credit quality has not changed from all we can see, but the underlying bureaucratic process and regulatory environment has and it may be that we end up pointing to something modestly higher than 50 basis points going forward, again, not because the customer changed but more because the process did. Eric Wolfe : Got it. That's helpful. And I guess that sort of brings up how much more would be just with the new normal of a bureaucratic process like that make it 50 and 70. But I guess my other question was really just on the loss to lease at this point in the year, sort of how you think that informs blended rent growth next year. Because I assume the loss lease will probably just go lower, maybe be like zero by the end of the year. You included it in the presentation, but wasn't sure how to translate that sort of 0.8% loss to lease in the October to some type of rent growth in 2024. Michael Manelis : Eric, this is Michael. So yes, the 80 basis points that we included in the management presentation, the snapshot as of October 15, and we're just giving you the historical context. So that number will kind of decelerate a little bit as you get towards the end of the year. But there's nothing that suggests that right now, we don't expect our loss to lease to be in a relatively normal place to start the year. In terms of how you fold that into the blended assumptions for next year, I'm going to kind of stay away from giving any specific guidance on '24. I think what I would look at is the hardest part of the piece right now is for us is that intraperiod growth rate. What are you going to layer in by market? And we're in the very early stages of this budget process that includes both a top-down and bottom-up approach. But I could tell you that we do expect like Seattle and the expansion markets to be pressured from new supply. We continue to see and expect the strength in the East Coast markets, and we'll model some solid growth in Southern California, driven in part by the improvements in delinquency that we just talked about. San Francisco has potential, but I think you could tell from the prepared remarks, we're going to need to see a few consecutive quarters of improving fundamentals like before we adjust the somewhat muted current expectations for next year. But if you really put all those factors together, you look at where that embedded range is, you think about loss to lease being in a relatively normal. You hold in the intra-period comments that I just gave you, it really does still put you in a place where we expect to see solid growth next year. Eric Wolfe : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to John Pawlowski with Green Street. John Pawlowski : First question is on the transaction market. It feels like private market pricing, particularly in the Sunbelt has been very slow to adjust the reality of higher rates, but also declines in market rent. So curious in recent quarters, have you considered setting a complete pause on these one-off acquisitions in the Sunbelt? Or are you considering that going forward until more distress flows through the private market? Mark Parrell : John, it's Mark. I'll start with that. I mean we have been matched funding that. So, this year, it was a pretty modest year for us, $350-odd million of buys and sells. And frankly, we have paused our acquisition activity. The deals you saw closed, they priced really in the early second quarter, and one of them went through a long assumption -- loan assumption process and the other one had a lease-up and an elongated close process. So, we really aren't buying anything right now. What you see out there in the release is really that tail activity. We may expose a few more assets for sale. We're always doing that, trying to figure out where that market is. And continue to execute on the strategy of moving the capital around. But before we commit to your point to buy assets at this price, we're going to sort of let market settle out a bit or look for an opportunity to just obviously very good. John Pawlowski : Okay. Makes sense. Last question is on New Jersey rent control. So obviously, there's some media rumors out there about a few assets being subject to control. And so, hoping you can give us a range of potential financial impacts on these assets? And then is there additional risk working in New Jersey port your broader Jersey portfolio that we may hear about in the coming months or years? Mark Parrell : Yes. Thanks, John. So, I'll give a little color on that. I'm not going to be able to be terribly specific because it is pending litigation and giving you a range is something I'm just not able to do. But we are the only ones facing these sorts of issues, both public and private competitors of ours in Northern New Jersey have these litigation concerns. In our case, the particular matter you're talking about in Jersey City, there was a ruling in our favor actually a year ago that these properties, these two towers were exempt from rent control by an administrative entity that administers these rent rules. The decision that was announced a couple of weeks ago was by a politically appointed Board that overruled the bureau's original decision here and we completely disagree with that. And we're going to go and litigate that in the courts and have our say there and try not to talk about it too much in the press, except to say, again, we think whether it's in Northern New Jersey or elsewhere in the portfolio, we follow the rules of the road. We feel like we comply with, whether it's rental control rules or notice rules or whatever they may be in all these markets, those rules are complex. They're ever-changing. We've got a great legal team, a great operations team that follows up on all that. So, I don't have any sense of an overhanging doom, but I think this is another sign of just political pressure that's manifesting itself in litigation in some of these markets rather than in just going through the process of trying to influence your public officials to change the rental rules. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : And Mark, maybe just continuing that theme on the Jersey City. You and I have chatted before on the risks of tax-exempt deals and deals that have incentives that years or decades later could come back to bite. So, in thinking about this, do you still see the appetite for EQR to pursue deals, especially in politically charged municipalities, deals that have tax incentives as worth the longer-term risk? Or what's going on here is your view is, hey, when we underwrite these deals, even if we shave off a few points for the risk -- for the political risk, going after these tax incentive deals are still economically worth it. Mark Parrell : Yes. Thanks for the question, Alex. I go up a level and say political risk. So, when you look at these markets, it's more about us managing political risk in these markets and our feelings about regulatory matters. In New Jersey, I think, is a market. We are rational capital allocators that is probably disqualified itself from material additional investment by us in terms of development or new asset acquisitions because some of these regulatory things are coming out of left field. They're really not the result of incentives, these particular ones, incentives on construction. What was done is these were placed in a state where for a number of years, they were exempt from local existing rent control rules. And that's what this whole discussion is about. It's not about sort of a 421-A type question, just to be clear, but I get your point. For example, in Atlanta, almost everything built there has a tax incentive. That tax incentive is really well understood. We priced it in there at the beginning. We understand the cap rate and we understand what happens at the end of the deal in terms of the incentive going away 10 years in or whatnot. So I guess it's more of an indicator of these different lawsuits of political risk and places that I think for us and for others, will be less attractive to allocate development capital or acquisition capital and places like Atlanta where you feel more comfortable with political risk, and it's just really an underwriting exercise to price the tax benefit in the deal that the city did with good reason to try and encourage affordable housing in that market or at least buildings that have affordable components. Alexander Goldfarb : And then the second question, by the way, Mark, just speaking of political risk, obviously, rents being down shoots a hole in the whole yield star litigation argument. So, I guess, yes, there is a positive at our third quarter earnings but thinking about Seattle and San Francisco, those are two markets where the downtowns continue to suffer and have issues recovering. By contrast, the issues in the Sunbelt are really, there's a lot of supply this year, into next, and then that supply goes away.  So, as you think longer term, it almost seems like the resolution of Seattle and San Francisco, to your point, is political, and it's unknown for the recovery, whereas the Sunbelt is known because you can see the product delivering and that there's nothing behind it. So again, think about EQR and capital allocation, are you guys still comfortable in the belief that Seattle and San Fran downtowns will recover? Or at what point do you sort of throw up your hands and go, the traditional recovery isn't there, we have to think differently this time. Mark Parrell : Yes. Thanks. Great question. So, I'm going to start by saying the Sunbelt definitely will have a lot less supply in three years, but it doesn't mean there will never be more supply again. I mean it's proven every bit of the cycle, that happens again. So, I want to speak to San Francisco, and it's merit Seattle real quick and then sum it up here. But we've got to have a little longer-term perspective for us because we're long-term investors in these markets. So, a little background on San Francisco. I know you've been around the real estate world a long time.  This is probably the best-performing large market in terms of rent growth in the country over long periods of time. It's got the high housing costs we want, it's got these big barriers to supply. It's got often explosive high wage job growth. And it's historically been a super desirable place for our resident demographic to live, but lately, I admit a little less so. Prop 13 also helps us limit those real estate tax increases, and that's our biggest expense. So, there's -- the framing in that market is very good. But it is a volatile market. And that's part of why we've been saying since 2018, we wanted to lower exposure. But you get paid for the volatility. So, for example, post-GFC, EQR same-store revenues in San Francisco, they were down over 2% each year for two years in a row. So, we got hammered a little bit there. But for the next five years, on average, our same-store revenue was up 9% a year. I think our shareholders got paid back for taking that risk and volatility. I think the conditions in the job market in San Francisco can improve pretty rapidly. It certainly -- along with Redmond, Washington, the center of the artificial intelligence employment boom that we hope is coming but I will fully concede there's an elongated recovery going out in San Francisco. And this management team is responsible. If it's responsible for anything, it's responsible for being optimistic. And some of the things we saw in the middle of the year in that market made us feel like that recovery was coming right now. We still have faith that will come. But in terms of capital allocation, we're going to lighten the load downtown. We've said that. We have been selling in that market. We even sold this quarter so far, an asset in San Francisco, but we like that exposure to the tech industry there. We still think it's the tech capital of the world. And the argument on Seattle is not a lot different. I mean it has been a strong performer over time. Again, when we look back on that market, we were down, gosh, 4% on average for two years in 2009 and 2010 after the GFC. And then we're up 6% or more for five years after that. So again, you get paid for your volatility. Seattle is a place where our balance is a little off where we have been saying and we have been moving assets and capital out of downtown and into the suburbs and you'll see us continue to do that but we like that market. So, I believe -- I think the management team and the Board believes in those markets. I think we are a little overexposed to San Francisco. We've been forward about that. A little exposed to the downtown areas. But longer term, we think that's where this demographic of high-wage earners who aren't going to lose their jobs because AI aren't going to lose their jobs because automation are going to get the biggest pay increases, can handle all this inflation risk. That's what we think these people are, so that's where we're headed with our capital. But I'm as impatient as you are to see those markets improve. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you, Mark. Operator : We'll go next to Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Haendel St. Juste : I'd like to get some clarification on a comment you made earlier in your remarks that it's not uncommon to see new lease rate declines of minus 4% to minus 5% by December. And given the weakness in San Fran and Seattle that, you expect you'll be slightly more negative than that. So, am I correct to read that you're implying that your entire portfolio, new lease rates that you expect to be minus 4% to minus 5% or potentially weaker? And then what does that sort of imply for these rates you're expecting for San Fran and Seattle by that point? Thanks. Michael Manelis : Yes. Haendel, this is Michael. So yes, just to give you like some historical context. So, when we say historical norms, I'm really just looking at like 2017, 2018, 2019. And to give you -- in new lease change would typically in the month of October, be like a negative 1.5% to 2%. November goes down to like a negative 3% to a negative 4% and December would be like a negative 4% or negative 5%. So right now, you're seeing we're putting up a number in October, that's a negative 3.1% because of the inclusion of San Francisco and Seattle and really the pronounced concession use that we have going on in those markets. So, as you think about the fourth quarter for us, I think our new lease change for the full quarter is going to be somewhere around a negative 4% but if you go all the way to the month of December, given what we're seeing, I don't know why we won't be a negative 5% or even slightly above that negative 5% in that spot month. But for the quarter itself, I would put new lease change somewhere around that close to negative 4%. Renewals have been really stable for us and really have been doing better than what we thought. We will hold somewhere right around that 5% net effective change on achieved renewal increases. And when you put those two factors together, that's going to give you a blended somewhere around 1.25% give or take, 10 basis points either way. Haendel St. Juste : Got it. And any color or any views you want to share on new lease rates for San Fran and Seattle? Michael Manelis : So, look, I mean we're running high single digits right now. I think San Francisco stays kind of at that level. And I think a little bit has to do with if you back up and think about what were we doing in the fourth quarter this time last year, we did have concessions in play in Seattle. So, we were like a minus 6% new lease change in the fourth quarter of last year. So, I would tell you, maybe we kind of just hold the line in this high single digit for the balance of the year in those markets. Haendel St. Juste : Great. That's helpful. And if I may, one more. I'm trying to get a better understanding of the range of reasonable expectation that we should have for your same-store revenue next year. You outlined in your presentation the earnings of 1.3% to 1.5%, which is helpful. But the new and renewals getting softer, blended towards 2% for the fourth quarter, negative new leases. The bad debt is improving. But further than you expected and occupancy, I think based on a bit of a tough comp. So, I guess putting it all together, I can't quite seem to get to the same store revenue projection for next year above the mid-2s? Is that maybe unfair or what maybe could I be missing or underappreciating. Mark Parrell : Well, I appreciate the question, Haendel, it's Mark, but we can't answer that with any specificity. We -- just sort of sharing what we know at this time, we're in the middle of the budget process, which is both top-down and bottoms up. In places like Seattle and the expansion markets supply and close in proximate supply is going to matter. Other places we're looking at job forecasts and how well occupied we are. So, I think that's just news yet to be written. Haendel St. Juste : Fair enough. But maybe can I ask you about Rite Aid and how you think about backfilling those stores and if we expect -- should expect that to be a drag or maybe a tailwind to next year? Alexander Brackenridge : Haendel, it's Alex. We actually have a lease in place already. So, we're very excited about it. It's going to be a good user. It's going to be a great amenity for our residents and for the neighborhood. So, it's a matter of getting them into the space, and that's going to take a little bit of time through next year, six months or so and then they'll be in place. Robert Garechana : Yes. And Haendel, from a P&L standpoint, as Alex mentioned, there's two things that will go on to determine the P&L is just how fast those folks get in place, the new lease because that's when we'll start recognizing the revenue for them in 2024 and what that impact is relative to the write -- we had the write-off which you're not going to have again in our base year in 2023. So those two pieces in that rate of growth. But I would expect -- in all likelihood, it will be relatively flat because you had the impact in '23 of the $1.5 million write-off. Haendel St. Juste : Appreciate. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Josh Dennerlein : Just wanted to touch base on the same-store CapEx, you increased it again to $3,600 per apartment unit. I looked back like a year ago, I think it was like $2,600 per apartment. Just kind of curious what's going on there? What are you guys seeing? And if there's any shifting from like same-store expenses into CapEx buckets or just rising costs? Alexander Brackenridge : Josh, it's Alex. Yes, you're right. It did go up, but it went up for a variety of reasons that I'll go through, not related to shifting expenses into capital. It's really related to starting the year thinking that spending capital on our portfolio was a more compelling use of capital than acquisitions or development. And we had a big budget. I always handicapped the budget a little bit because things generally take a little longer its construction, things go wrong, contractors, misstates and through the first half of the year, we are right on track for that. We actually had a very productive summer, and so we ended up doing more work than I thought we would do. So, it's partially that. It's also -- we added in some ROI projects, specifically some solar panel installations that have a great return that weren't available to us until the middle of the year. And we did have some storm damage that carried through into the third quarter. And on top of that, we've had some smart rent installations that we've accelerated that added on top of that. So, we expect that next year, we'll be back more in a normalized spend rate. And again, it doesn't relate to any accounting changes. Josh Dennerlein : Okay. Great. Appreciate that color. And then I wanted to just explore the cadence of lease rate growth through October, I guess, particular the new. Was there -- as October was progressing, was there like a big drop off towards the tail end of the month? And then if there was, were you kind of doing that in response to maintaining occupancy? Or just kind of what's the dynamic playing out? Michael Manelis : Josh, this is Michael. I think I would back you up a little bit and say it's probably like that third week in September. And again, you're hitting a period of time which you see seasonal softening. So, it is not uncommon to see demand start to soften. And what we saw in that kind of later part of September specifically in the San Francisco and Seattle market, as things were trailing off, you clearly saw a market react very quickly with concessions increasing and rates coming down to basically get enough demand to hold occupancies. And that has manifested itself throughout the month of October with continuing deceleration, but it's not like the deceleration has been even more rapid through October. I would tell you it's kind of been at this level now for a while, but we do expect rates to keep decelerating a little bit. But the demand right now in those markets needs to be stronger in order to stop the deceleration rate. And we're just -- we don't have anything that would suggest that we should model that way right now. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Michael Goldsmith : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. We've seen new lease rate growth fall quite a bit faster than renewal rate. So how long can the gap remain wide? And are renewing residents more aware of pricing and pushing back harder on renewals? Or are they just accepting the rent increase? Thanks. Michael Manelis : Yes. Michael, this is Michael. So, we are negotiating a little bit more, but again, that's not uncommon to do in the fourth quarter of any year. We have quotes out for the next 90 days. I think our residents are clearly aware of what's happening in the marketplace. You definitely have kind of more conversations being -- taking place within our centralized renewal team. We're negotiating. We have quotes out somewhere in that kind of mid-7% range, and we expect to achieve somewhere around the 5%, maybe it's like low 7s to mid-7 depending on the month that we have out there. But we have a lot of confidence that the spread you're seeing is not uncommon to see in the fourth quarter. If new lease rates typically go negative, our renewals typically hold up in that 4% to 5% range. So, I don't really see anything that suggests that the spread is not going to continue as we see it. And then as we turn the year, again, it's really more of a function of what happens with intra-period rate growth. But as you start the year off, you'll see us start tightening up some of the renewal negotiations, but we expect a lot of stability on that renewal front. And what we're still trying to figure out is how to peg that new lease change assumption for the year. Michael Goldsmith : That makes sense. And my second question is, in this environment, how do you think about your relationship with Toll Brothers? Is there a greater opportunity to push harder and deliver units into a more favorable supply environment in the expansion markets? And then along with that, have you changed your acquired yields on development? Thanks. Mark Parrell : I'm going to split that in half and talk about Toll. It's Mark and I'm going to ask Alex to speak to our required hurdle rates on development. So, we have a great relationship with the folks at Toll. They see the same thing we do, that there's a need to moderate development in some of these markets. We have three deals delivering. One of them, we move forward a couple of quarters. I mean their -- Toll is everything we thought they were. They're an expert developer builder. They're doing a great job. Obviously, we're going to face those same supply issues in Dallas that everybody else is when these 3 assets get up and running. So, I'm not sure why we delay anything. I'm getting the asset up and running getting heads and beds, getting income, that's in our in the shareholders' best interest. So that's what we'll do. And we're just -- we're assuming that starting at the beginning of next year, middle of next year, we'll have all three of those development deals in the lease-up process. And we'll report back. But I wouldn't delay any of those. If you're talking about other starts with Toll and anyone else, that goes more to Alex response on hurdle rates. Alexander Brackenridge : Yes. And I think -- it's Alex. With the 10-year in the high 4s, you think cap rates have got to be in the high 5s. And you think that development yields have got to be mid-6s or high 6s. So, the challenge right now is just getting a project to underwrite with that hurdle. Construction costs are not going up like they used to, but they're not going dramatically down and rents are not booming. So, it's very hard to get to a number that underwrites and Toll understands that and so do our other potential partners and ourselves as we look at projects we might do on our own or with partners, it just very, very difficult to make the numbers work. Michael Manelis : But I want to interject one thing because there are a couple of development deals we're looking at now that we like, that are in markets in the Northeast. And the thing that really distinguishes them is the really hard places to buy. So, we look at these assets, they have the benefit of having certain zoning and electrical codes and other things that are beneficial. It might be to start that deal or start one or two of these deals, but we're being super selective. We haven't started anything this year. But we do have instances like that where there's an opportunity to build somewhere that you really can't buy in and where we like that exposure where we might be willing to move forward even if it isn't really high 6%, mid-6% return, but the return and the sort of overall IRR in the long haul makes some sense. So yet to come on that, but I do want to put that out there. Michael Goldsmith : Thank you, very much. Operator : We'll go next to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Thank you. I wanted to ask about Seattle and your comments today that seems like it's more of a demand issue and a lack of job growth versus last quarter, where I think you cited it was more of a supply risk and there was a lot of optimism on the Amazon return office. So, I guess my question is, has that Amazon pull faded and maybe disappointed as far as drawing in employees and some of the peers? And when do you expect the supply to peak in Downtown Seattle? Michael Manelis : John, this is Michael. So, I think last quarter, what you heard us speaking to is with Amazon's return to the office mandate, you did see South Lake Union's occupancy tick up. You saw the demand pick up. It wasn't in migration from outside the MSA, it was just pulling people back in from further out within the MSA into that specific area. And in South Lake Union, we did have some new lease-ups. Those lease-ups did feel like they were getting kind of their application volume through. So, you saw concession use really kind of pull back a little bit or stay stable. So, the pressure we felt was a little bit less in that specific area. If you fast forward into next year, Seattle is going to have elevated supply, and that supply is going to be concentrated in the city of Seattle, and we are going to feel that specifically in like a micro submarket of like Downtown Redmond where we happen to have six properties, five of which are really a product that will compete head-to-head with that supply. So, in terms of like how to think about when that pressure is coming to us next year, I don't have the breakout for the new leasing stats by quarter. But I do know that it's not like Q1 is not when we're expecting to feel it. I think we have a little bit of a ramp-up period, but we do expect outside pressure in that market. John Kim : Okay. That's helpful. And then, Mark, one of your answers, you mentioned that acquisitions are in pause for now. I was wondering if there was a cap rate or spread to your cost of capital over the 10-year that you would be looking to transact at? Or is it more about the timing and the volume activity anticipated over the next six months to nine months and for selling in the market? Mark Parrell : We remain open for business and acquisitions. We're underwriting deals. They just have to make sense relative to our cost of capital. We're looking for a discount to current replacement cost. So, it is right now at a pause because the market isn't offering us that opportunity. And usually, it happens that there's a whole bunch of deals that people have signed up and everyone just close them at the end of the year, and that's not what's going on there. So there likely isn't going to be a lot more exposed for sale until the beginning of next year.  So, I'm not sure this situation is going to change much. Like I don't know that Alex and I and the Board are going to make big pronouncements about acquisitions in the next couple of months because there just won't be much to action on. But we're hopeful next year, you start to see folks that look at the higher for longer scenario on interest rates that maybe see some pressure on NOI and especially in the Sunbelt markets, and maybe are more open to selling and folks like us that are more open to buying. The last point to make is what is our source of capital for that. If we're able to sell our assets in some of these over -- sort of over concentrated coastal areas that we like general exposure, but we're a little out of balance, if that's the fuel, then we'll be thinking a lot about the degree or not of dilution between those two. If we're borrowing money, we're going to think a lot about not just the beginning cap rate, but where it can reasonably go over the next few years. But right now, I think we'd be borrowers around 6.4% or so on 10 years, and that's a pretty significant hurdle. So those are the kind of things we're thinking about over there. Is that helpful framing for you? John Kim : Thank you, so much. Operator : We'll go next to Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Jamie Feldman : Great. Thank you, for taking my question. I guess sticking with acquisitions, what is your appetite as you think about your target markets? I mean what is your appetite to do something big? Are there -- as you look at the portfolios that are out there, are there anything that you think would be particularly interesting? Or do you think the game plan will be kind of singles and doubles as you sell out of more noncore? Alexander Brackenridge : Jamie, it's Alex. We're open to anything. The bigger is great for us. If the pricing makes sense and if the locations and the quality of the assets are good enough. And that's generally been the challenge with some of the portfolios we've seen over the last couple of years is that the mix of properties and locations just aren't compelling enough. So, we have been targeting one-offs, and we'll do that as well. But something big comes up, we'll certainly pursue it. But in the meantime, there's going to be a lot of product coming to the market at some point. And we really primed up for that, and we're excited to take advantage of that opportunity. Mark Parrell : Just to add, I mean, in 2021, the last time the market was open full blast, I mean, Alex bought and his team, more than $1.7 billion of assets, almost entirely in those expansion markets and a little bit in suburbs of Seattle and Boston. So, we are capable of hitting a lot of singles and scoring a lot of runs by doing that. So, we're happy to acquire in small dribs and drabs if that gets us to our goal. But as Alex said, we're open to portfolios, but they just need to make some sense. And a lot of what we've seen, you're getting three things you like and two you don't, you're not really ahead of the game. Jamie Feldman : Okay. So, I guess just listen to your answer, it sounds like there's nothing that would be a perfect fit at this point? Alexander Brackenridge : Yes. We're not looking for perfection to be clear, but there's nothing that's compelling right now. Jamie Feldman : Okay. And then I know there's been some questions on litigation. There's an article out talking about a DC RealPage lawsuit and you've been named as a defendant. Can you -- probably can't say much here, but can you give us any color on that at this point? Mark Parrell : You guess it right. I can't say very much. That just kind of came over the wire to us, too. We are unfortunately in a very good company with a lot of our public and private competitors are in that suit as well. So again, we haven't analyzed it. We haven't even been served to our knowledge. So, it's hard for me to have any real comment except to say it's not uncommon to have copycat lawsuits filed by other members of the plaintiffs\u2019 bar or by the states and the District of Columbia when you have a lawsuit like the antitrust case that's being litigated in Tennessee and Federal Court that's out there and gets publicity. I'm not sure it's a new risk. It's the same risk in a different place. And again, let us analyze it, and if it's appropriate to comment further, we will. Jamie Feldman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Rich Anderson with Wedbush. Rich Anderson : Thanks. Good morning. A question to Michael. You mentioned the history of negative 4% to negative 5% by December. If you look at that same history, what's the new lease rate typically change to by the time we get to April or May? Michael Manelis : Rich, this is Michael. I don't have that in front of me right now, but I can tell you that it clearly steps up and it's got to be in the positive 1% or 2% range because it's just going to keep sequentially building as you turn the corner into the year. Rich Anderson : Of course, that would be expected. I was just wondering if you had some specific numbers for December, I thought maybe I'd ask you about specific... Michael Manelis : I don't have that specific number by month outside of this fourth quarter. But I'd be surprised if it's not up near that 1% or greater number. Rich Anderson : Okay. And then going back to L.A. and perhaps the opportunity cost of having to deal with all this litigation and so on, is there a common thread to some of these bad actors that maybe you don't want to sort of put them in a group publicly, but maybe that there's some cleansing that can happen so that you don't -- you say you can avoid some of this scenario that's perhaps bound to happen in the future? Is there a changing -- change to your leasing sort of documentation or your credit quality process to sort of avoid a certain sort of segment of the renting population on a go-forward basis? Or is it just... Mark Parrell : Rich, it's Mark. I'm trying to answer that. I mean there are tons of rules about who you can and can't rent to. And California, as you sort of implied, as more rules than most, and we're certainly going to comply meticulously with all of those rules. But this is, again, an issue when you create this regulatory framework where delinquency is more expensive, you do motivate us, and we are using our data analytics tools and other means to try and determine whether our credit standards should be raised even further because now the marginal cost of delinquency, which is what your question was getting at, is higher. So, we need to decide whether instead of, call it, three times income to rent, we need 3.5. But we need to do that thoughtfully. We need to do that in a way that doesn't completely tank occupancy. So again, we're rational actors like all the operators are in that market. And we have the advantage of having a great team and a lot of good analytics, but we'll certainly comply with the law, but we're going to look really hard at is there a different cutoff, but there is no group of bad actors. There's not like some particular percentage that's causing this problem. It's more that the processing of delinquencies takes longer. So therefore, just the normal delinquency is in the building three months instead of two. And so now I have one extra month, that's real money, what do we do to address that? Maybe nothing, but maybe it is a change, too. But I think are already pretty stringent credit standards. And so, we'll see where we go with that. Rich Anderson : Is there an AI application to this possibly? Michael Manelis : Yes. Rich, this is Michael. So, I guess I can just answer a little bit on that and tell you, as an industry, it is exciting. Mark mentioned a little bit around the data and analytics. But what you're seeing within our industry is there is a lot more available data around this. There are new kind of screening tools that are coming to the market, screening processes that do leverage kind of different data points than conventionally the industry has looked at. There's clearly identity verification tools that are coming into play, not only for the touring side, but the application side. And you're starting to see more and more of this alternative security deposit kind of programs come into play. I think all of these things together in the blender actually do help start mitigating some of what I would characterize as fraud or bad actors in the system. Rich Anderson : That\u2019s great. Thank you, very much. Operator : We'll go next to Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Adam Kramer : Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask about the earnings, which I know you guys put in from your slide deck, I always find the deck to be really helpful. I guess if I'm just looking at that 1.3% to 1.5% range, I'm assuming that's kind of your assumption today for what the earning will be going into next year, so on January 1? So just to confirm that. And then maybe just thinking about over the last two months of the year, what could kind of change that number, right? And maybe a focus on San Francisco and Seattle specifically, would there be some risk to that number? Or is kind of further softening in those two markets already kind of embedded in that embedded growth? Michael Manelis : Yes. Adam, this is Michael. I think right now, we put the range out there because it is hard to move that number much more than 10 basis points. And it is our assumption as to where do we land on 12/31. So, you start 1/1, what does that rent roll look like? And what is the embedded growth from the leases that you have in place. Typically, we wouldn't really give a range, we'd give a number, but you do have some volatility sitting out there right now, not on kind of the renewal front, the growth that we're going to get from renewals feel pretty stable. But you could see concessions tick up. You could see rates decelerate a little bit more or the inverse. You could see things pull back a little bit. And that's why we're giving you that 10 basis point spread. The midpoint of our guidance is PEG at the 1.4% which is the middle of that embedded growth. Adam Kramer : That's really helpful, Michael. And then maybe just a follow-up on the -- kind of the pricing trend seasonality charts in the deck. I always find this would be really helpful. I guess I'm just trying to kind of square this with the kind of year-over-year new lease numbers that you talked to. I think it's going to be minus 4%, minus 5% as we kind of progress through the rest of the year for new lease. I recognize that, obviously, there's seasonality here, right, things on a sequential basis are going to worsen. I guess I'm just a little bit surprised that the minus 4%, minus 5%, that should be a year-over-year figure, if I'm not mistaken, right? So, it should kind of already include the impact seasonality? Again, apologies, it's a little bit of a conceptual question here maybe, but just trying to kind of square the kind of seasonal versus sequential, I guess, kind of discussion here. Robert Garechana : Yes. I'll start and maybe Michael can augment, if you will. So, I think if I understand your question right, you're kind of looking at the pricing trend looking at the spread between the lines, and saying, like, how does that square with my new lease change? And I guess I would tell you to start on your new lease change. There is a lot of noise around mix, and we do all terms. So, we report all terms in our new lease change. So that means that you could have had a lease that was signed in August that was for -- at a premium rent that was for three months reset in October. And therefore, you're going to have a much bigger change than what would be reflected if you just looked at those lines and said, everybody is on a 12-month lease, everybody's on a year-over-year basis, and that does create a decent amount of noise. If you look and dig into the numbers, there. You also have some level of -- even though these are small as a percentage of total, meaning most of our leases are 12 months, there's enough noise in there and enough volatility in the transaction base to not make that comparison kind of apples-to-apples. What we do think is really helpful for the price -- in pricing trend and why we present it is just to look at the overall kind of directionality of where prices are going and where they are relative to seasonal trends overall. So, I would say the pricing trend is best suited for a directional viewpoint and the new lease change is really what's going into the revenue line and it's really what's supporting your GRP and your revenue overall.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Equity Residential Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead, sir. Marty McKenna : Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential\u2019s fourth quarter 2023 results and outlook for 2024. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; Alec Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer; and Bob Garechana, our CFO. Our earnings release is posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell. Mark J. Parrell: Thank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter 2023 results and the outlook for 2024. I will start us off, then Michael Manelis, our COO, will speak to our operating performance and 2024 operating expectations, and followed by Alec Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, who'll give some color on our capital allocation activities in the transactions markets. And then finally, Bob Garechana, our CFO, will review our 2024 guidance and our balance sheet, and then we'll take your questions. We are pleased with our fourth quarter performance, which was in-line with our October expectations. Our performance in 2023 was supported by a strong employment situation, more than 2.7 million new jobs created. And while the 2024 outlook for overall jobs is more muted, we should benefit from a continued low unemployment rate for the college educated, which currently sits around 2.1%, as well as continued good real wage growth. We will also benefit in 2024 from having low exposure to new supply in the vast majority of our markets, particularly when compared to the Sunbelt markets, as well as the customer comfortably able to pay our rents with current rent income levels at about 20%. Overall, with low unemployment and rising real wages, our target renter demographic remains in good shape. They are likely to rent with us longer as the prospect of homeownership in the near-term seems less likely with scarce inventory and relatively high mortgage rates. Less than 8% of our residents who moved out gave bought home as a reason to depart in 2023, which is the lowest we have seen since we started tracking the number. And over the next decade, the significant net deficit of housing across our country sets us up for good long-term demand. Drilling down on the West Coast, we do see clear signs of improvement in quality of life and energy on the street in the urban centers of Seattle and San Francisco. We continue to believe a recovery in rental rates in the downtown submarkets of these metros is coming and expect our shareholders will benefit from catch up rental growth in these places, where rents are still at or a fair bit below 2019 levels and where incomes, both on a nominal and real basis, have risen substantially since 2019. So, while we have not baked the material improvement in Seattle and San Francisco performance in our 2024 guidance expectations, we do note that other urban centers damaged by the pandemic and other negative trends, for example, New York City, reignited quickly and sharply off of depressed rent levels once quality of life and employment conditions improved. Switching to the cost side of the equation, our consistent ability to grow expenses and overhead more slowly than our competitors. We'll preserve cash flow for our shareholders as rent growth slows across the country and positions us well once growth picks back up. As it relates to capital allocation, before Alec, goes through the details of our recent transaction activities and our view of forward market conditions, I do want to highlight that we bought back some of our stock in the fourth quarter for the first time in many years. We bought back a little more than 864,000 EQR common shares for a total of about $49 million spent at about $57 per share. We funded this repurchase activity with proceeds from sales during January of less desirable assets that were on average 40 years old and we're sold at a 5.6% disposition yield and believe that at this stock price and funded with these disposition proceeds, buying our shares makes a very good investment, especially given the lack of available assets to acquire at reasonable prices. Before I turn the call over, I want to thank our teams across the company for their continued hard work and dedication to serving our customers and producing strong results for our shareholders. Now I'll turn call over to Michael Manelis. Michael L. Manelis: Thanks, Mark. This morning, I will review our fourth quarter 2023 operating performance and our outlook for 2024. We produced same store revenue growth of 3.9% and same store expense growth of only 1.3% in the fourth quarter, both of which were in-line with our expectations. On the expense side, our low growth in the quarter and full-year 4.3% growth were helped by modest property tax cost as well as the savings produced as we continue to roll out initiatives focused on creating operating efficiencies and a seamless customer experience. On the revenue side, the momentum in December was a little better than we thought as sequentially we grew revenue in the fourth quarter by holding onto more occupancy, while maintaining positive blended rate growth. This set us up for a good start in 2024. Demand was solid across our markets and consistent with seasonal expectations. We finished the year with same store physical occupancy at 96% as we focused on building up occupancy in the slower part of our leasing cycle. Today, the portfolio is above 96%. As expected, we saw new lease rates go negative in the quarter as they typically do. Meanwhile, renewal rates for the quarter came in at 5.1%, which was slightly above our expectations. Together, this resulted in a fourth quarter blended rate growth of positive 80 basis points. These healthy fundamentals led to outstanding revenue growth in our East Coast markets and good growth in Southern California. As has been the case all year, the East Coast markets outperform the West Coast and by and large will likely continue to do so in 2024. As you saw in our earnings release, we have provided 2024 same store revenue guidance range of up 2% to 3%. The building blocks for this growth starts with embedded growth of 1.4% and a midpoint assumption that both physical occupancy and cash concessions remain consistent with that of 2023. We expect the year to follow the traditional pre-COVID historical patterns with rent growth sequentially picking up in the spring and likely peaking in August. Our midpoint assumes renewals for the year averaged just over 4%. New lease change is relatively flat, which together produces blended rate growth of about 2%. This is more modest growth than the 2023 full-year blended rate growth of 3.1% and is reflective of a slowing job growth environment offset by a mostly positive supply situation in our coastal market, where we have about 95% of our NOI. As you can see from the stats in the release, January is starting out the way we would expect with new lease change improving, a strong percent of residents renewing, and a renewal rate achieved that is healthy, albeit moderating a bit. While still early, all of these January trends support our outlook for the year, which includes a view that resident retention remains very good, as a result of both the benefits of a centralized renewal process, our enhanced data and analytics insights and the high cost and low availability of owned housing in our markets. Turnover in the portfolio remains some of the lowest that we have seen in the history of our company and we expect that trend to continue in 2024. Orange County, San Diego, Boston, and Washington DC will lead the pack with expected revenue growth of approximately 4%. New York and LA will follow closely behind. At the moment, we expect slightly positive same store revenue growth in San Francisco and Seattle, and in our expansion markets, which reflect only about 5.5% percent of the total company NOI, we expect to produce negative same store revenue growth given the unprecedented levels of supply being delivered. As we look to the individual markets, starting with Boston, with high occupancy and limited new competitive supply. This market should continue to perform well in 2024. The market is supported by a strong employment base and finance, tech, life science, health and education. New supply deliveries will be about the same this year as they were in 2023, and this is a market where our urban assets have outperformed suburban ones lately and we expect that trend to continue in 2024. New York should continue to perform well this year, but won't reach the high rate growth achieved over the last few years. Occupancies remain high and competitive new supply is limited, which led to record high market rents, causing some rate fatigue to be observed in late in '23. New supply deliveries will be similar to last year with very little being delivered in Manhattan, where a large part of our portfolio is located. Washington DC continues to outperform our expectations despite the delivery of a good amount of new supply. The market delivered over 13,000 units in 2023 and saw the great majority of those units absorbed. This year, the market will see a similar amount of deliveries, but demand has been strong and we expect this good performance to continue. We are starting the year with occupancies above 97%, which is a great position to be in. In Los Angeles, we expect the tailwind to growth as we work through the delinquency and bad debt issues that have been concentrated here. We continue to make progress, although the court system remains slow, taking at least six months from our court filing to being able to get the unit back. Bob will give some more color on the impact of bad debt net on our 2024 earnings expectations. New supply deliveries will be slightly higher this year with our Mid-Wilshire Koreatown and San Fernando Valley portfolio seeing the largest impact from this new supply. Strong retention and solid demand will continue to aid our ability to fill vacant units with paying residents in this market. Rounding out Southern California, San Diego, and Orange County should be some of our highest growth markets this year, driven by high occupancies and a general lack of housing. High homeownership costs make renting in these markets a more attractive option. San Diego will see more competitive new supply in 2024, while Orange County will see similar amounts to last year. In San Francisco and Seattle, we had little to no pricing power throughout 2023 and our base case expectations for this year assume that situation continues. We have seen periods of stability and then pullbacks. Concession use in both markets is widespread. We have strong physical occupancy with both markets being above 96%, which tells us there is demand, although it is very price sensitive. As Mark mentioned, the downtown areas of both markets continue to see improvement in the quality of life, but are still lacking the catalyst of return to office and or job growth. New supply in San Francisco this year will be up from last year levels, mostly due to an increase in the South Bay, although continued healthy demand in this submarket should aid the absorption. Seattle is likely to be the most impacted of any of our markets when it comes to new supply deliveries with increases in both the City of Seattle and the Eastside. The lack of expected job growth combined with this new supply has driven our low expectations in Seattle for 2024. Both Seattle and San Francisco continue to see less than normal inbound migration. Seattle in the fourth quarter, however, did see some relative improvement with new residents coming to us from out of state. This positive trend is something that we will keep an eye on as we move through the spring leasing season. Drawing new residents back to the MSAs in both Seattle and San Francisco would be a catalyst for these markets to outperform our expectations. In the expansion markets, our long-term outlook remained positive. That said, high levels of new supply are already pressuring rents and is likely to continue throughout 2024. At present, we are operating from a defensive position and starting the year with occupancies that are two to three percentage points above the market averages. Denver has demonstrated the most stability despite having limited pricing power in the portfolio, and we expect the market to produce slightly positive same store revenue growth in 2024. Currently, Atlanta is using the least demonic concessions, but we expect a few of our assets to be very challenged due to the sheer number of lease ups in close proximity, which will likely lead to negative revenue growth for the year. In Texas, Dallas and Austin have widespread concession use, and we expect all of our assets to experience direct pressure from new deliveries all year long, resulting in negative same store revenue growth in these markets. So, putting all of these factors together, our overall same store revenue outlook for 2024, right now anticipate solid growth led by the East Coast markets and Southern California, which collectively is almost 70% of our NOI. We expect our coastal existing markets to outperform our expansion markets where unprecedented supply will impact operations near-term. On the initiative side, in 2024, we will continue to focus on producing operating efficiencies and driving other income with projects tied to flexible living options, parking, renter's insurance, and monetizing technology deployed for the benefits of our residents. We are almost complete with the rollout of smart home technology across our portfolio, which will create further opportunities to share teams across properties and enable additional self-service options for residents. This, along with other ancillary income, should lead to total other income growth of 30 basis points excluding bad debt. As we sit here today, we like our positioning and look forward to capturing the opportunities the spring leasing season brings, which will help frame pricing power for the full year. I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to their residents and focus on delivering these results. With that, I will turn the call over to Alec, to walk through our capital allocation activities and the transaction market. Alexander Brackenridge : Thank you, Michael. Despite an unsettled transactions market, we remain steadfast in our efforts to continue to reposition our portfolio by increasing our presence in markets like Dallas-Fort Worth, Atlanta, Austin and Denver and expect to see more opportunities to do so as the year progresses. As we underwrite potential acquisitions, we are always mindful of heightened levels of supply pressuring rents in our expansion markets and reflect tempered rent growth and concessions as needed in our projections. Currently, the transaction market remains unusually choppy with volumes down 60% to 70% compared to 2022 and down 40% to 50% compared to a more typical year like 2019. Nonetheless pressures on sellers to transact continue to mount as does the volume of new developments being delivered in these markets. New developments in particular are often not capitalized to be held for the long-term, and even with rates decreasing over the last few months, carry costs are high. Owners of stabilized assets will also see pressure to transact, as loans mature and extensions that were agreed to with lenders last year expire. Despite the short-term operating challenges in our expansion markets, we remain committed to broadening our footprint in markets that will see strong job growth and household formations over time and lower regulatory risks. As regards our own transactions activity, we didn't acquire any assets in the fourth quarter, but we did sell three, a small property in Seattle, one in the Bay area and one in LA. On average, the properties were 40 years old and total sales proceeds were $185 million at an average 5.8% disposition yield. While transaction volume overall is very light, we are seeing some opportunities to lighten the load of non-core older assets primarily in our West Coast markets. Since the beginning of 2024, we've sold two additional properties, one in Southern California and a small deal in Boston for a total of $189 million at an average 5.6% disposition yield. We've allocated a portion of the capital from these sales to the share buyback activity Mark just mentioned. With ample access to capital either through asset sales or debt issuance and a property management presence in our expansion markets, we are well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. In terms of anticipated volume, our guidance for 2024 is $1 billion for both acquisitions and dispositions, but market conditions will dictate whether we can hit or even exceed these goals. Turning to development, in 2024, will complete six new apartment properties with a total cost expected to be $624 million and consisting of 1,982 units with lease ups commencing for two of those projects in Q1 and four in Q2. Three of those lease ups all through our joint venture program with Toll Brothers are in Dallas, while the remaining three, two in Denver and one in suburban New York City are JVs with other developers. Given the timing for completion and lease up, we don't expect meaningful contribution to NFFO growth in 2024, but would expect these projects to contribute more to 2025 growth. While our suburban New York project will see limited competition from new supply, not unexpectedly our lease ups in Dallas and Denver will see substantial new competition. We acknowledge that the competition may be challenging and anticipate as we may have to adjust pricing and concessions to meet the market, our projected stabilized yields, which at initial underwriting were on average a mid six maybe closer to six. We believe these lease ups once stabilized and past the current supply glut will provide good cash flow growth and be solid long-term investments. Beyond these deliveries, we will be very selective about starting any new projects with a primary focus on locations where it's hard to buy such as suburban Boston. I'll now turn the call over to Bob. Robert A. Garechana: Thanks, Alec. As Michael and Mark mentioned, 2023 ended up right in-line with our forecast last quarter. So, let's get right to guidance. Michael gave you most of the building blocks for same store revenue, but I'll finish up with bad debt, walk through drivers of same store expenses and normalized FFO and conclude with the balance sheet. In 2023, we were able to reduce bad debt significantly once the regulatory environment became more constructive. While we continue to work with non-paying residents, as we have during and after the pandemic, ultimately, we still ended up processing a high volume of skips and evicts. In fact, about 1.5 times pre-pandemic activity levels, which coupled with not adding significant amounts of new non-paying residents, helped us reduce bad debt as a percentage of same store revenue from well over 2% to just under 1.5%. So, great progress overall, but still a long way from the 50 basis points we were accustomed to pre-pandemic. Much like last year, we expect 2024 to continue to show improvement. We also expect the pace of this improvement to be dependent on the speed of the court systems, primarily in Southern California, where delinquency remains highest, to quickly process evictions, which is a hard thing to predict. As a result, our guidance assumes that 2024 remains another transition year for bad debt and that we don't get all the way back to pre-pandemic levels. Instead, our guidance midpoint assumes that full-year bad debt as a percentage of same store residential revenue is slightly above 1% or a 30 basis point contribution to 2024 growth overall. If that plays out, by the end of 2024, we would expect to be a little under two times pre-pandemic levels. Turning to expenses. Expense management is core strength at Equity Residential as evidenced by the historical performance Mark referenced. Our same store expense guidance of 4% is also reflective of that discipline. This year, the individual drivers of growth are a little different than those from 2023. So, let me give you a high level assessment, and we can get into more detail in Q&A if required. In 2024, we expect real estate taxes and utilities to grow faster than they did in 2023, in part due to some 421-A step ups and commodity prices, while payroll and repairs and maintenance should be slower due to various initiatives and an expected normalization of inflationary pressures. Insurance, a small category at less than 5% of total expenses, but a topic often discussed should grow more slowly than last year, but remain above the long-term trend with growth in the low-double-digits. Turning to normalized FFO, Page 2 of the release provides a detailed reconciliation of our forecasted contributors to NFFO growth. As is typical, same store NOI performance is the primary driver of growth, but let me provide some color on transaction activity. We are assuming $1 billion in both acquisitions and dispositions for 2024 with limited dilution, yet we show a $0.03 reduction in normalized FFO growth there. This is due to our assumption that our acquisition activity mostly occurs later in the year than our dispositions. This is also partially offset in interest expense and interest income as disposition proceeds are used to pay down debt or invested in interest bearing 1031 accounts while we await acquisitions. Now a very brief comment on the balance sheet, because we're in really great shape here. We have no debt maturities until the middle of 2025, modest outstanding balances on our commercial paper program and less than 10% floating rate debt. So, we're very well-positioned. In fact, over 50% of our existing debt doesn't mature until after 2030. The work we've done over the last number of years has reduced our interest rate exposure and allows us for ample debt capacity to run and grow our business. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from Steve Sakwa from Evercore. Please go ahead. Steve Sakwa : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I guess, wanted to just maybe go through some of the building blocks of growth in 2024 either for Michael or Bob. But as you kind of look through the moving pieces here. It seemed like maybe the new rate growth that kind of flattish might be one that could pose maybe a bit more of a challenge here of job growth slow. So, just curious how you sort of sized all up those components and how did you think about the new lease component with the fact that you kept occupancy flat, I guess, within the guidance? Michael L. Manelis: Yes. Hi, Steve. This is, Michael. I'll start. Maybe Bob can come over the top. So, I think when you look at the building blocks for the guidance, you need to realize, one, we're giving you a range, and there's a lot of different ways you can get there, but it's really the top level themes that underline and pin those midpoint assumptions. So, when we thought about new lease change, we started with the fact that we know the job growth is moderating this year, and, therefore, we would expect market rents or asking rents just to be kind of less than normal across the large majority of our markets. So we kind of model a normal seasonal slope for our kind of rent trend to build, and then we plug that in and we say, okay, what does that equate to? And right now, across our market, it's balancing out to basically be about flat on new lease change for the full year. Some of our markets are still positive. Some of our markets are still positive three, and some of the markets are still coming in at a negative growth through the year. But I think when you start to pull on any one of those, you need to go back to the top level themes and ask yourself, okay, what's really changing? So, if there's a material shift in job growth, sure. I think we would experience more pressure than we underlined in that the midpoint of our range. But again, it's, when does that happen in the year? And where are we? Because today, I'll tell you, we have taking a defensive position. We're starting the year with pretty strong occupancy that really gives us some confidence heading into the spring leasing season, and we'll just see kind of what pricing power emerges from that. Steve Sakwa : Great. And then just maybe one question on the transaction market. I know it's not been terribly, robust, but maybe, Alec, can you just speak to where you think maybe IRR hurdles are today that the 10 year is sort of plus or minus 4% come down way off the high. I realize NOI and rent growth is slowing, but where do you think investment hurdles are today either for EQR or for the market broadly speaking? Alexander Brackenridge : Hi, Steve, it's Alec. Thanks for the question. Well, as you stated, it's a pretty choppy market right now and there aren't a whole lot of data points. As you know, the NMHC, conference is going on in San Diego right now. So, I have some pretty current time information, which is really a reiteration of what we've been experiencing in the last few months, which is a standoff between buyers and sellers. Buyers generally looking for a 5.5ish cap and sellers generally looking for something closer to five. So, not an insurmountable gap at some point, but right now, it's hard to peg things. But, assuming things kind of land somewhere in between there at a 5.25. I think most people are shooting for an 8ish IRR and obviously it depends on the rent growth assumptions and the residual cap rate, but somewhere in that range, maybe a little bit less if they're going to be more aggressive. Steve Sakwa : Great. Thanks. That's it for me. Operator : And our next question is going to come from Eric Wolfe from Citi. Please go ahead. Unidentified Participant : Thanks. It's Nick here with Eric. Maybe just following up on that. So 8ish or so IRR, I guess, more specifically you talked about obviously the Sunbelt supply and the impact that has on your underwriting on those deals at least initially. So, when you're underwriting deals both on the buy and sell side today, what are you underwriting for IRRs in the Sunbelt? And then what are the IRRs look like for the assets you're planning to sell more coastal. Alexander Brackenridge : So, Eric I'm sorry. It's not Eric. Unidentified Participant : It's Nick. Alexander Brackenridge : Nick. Sorry, Nick. It's Alec. And, the IRRs don't end up being that different, if you assume that, sure, there's a glut of apartments in the Sunbelt right now, so the next couple of years are going to be tough. But after that, the start's already down a lot. The demand story hasn't changed. I think there's still these cities that we're interested in that some of which are Sunbelt cities, like Dallas, like Atlanta, like Denver and Austin, still our great job growth generators, still have a lot great long-term demand side story. So, I think you see a couple of years that are tough, but then you have a pretty good few years after that. And I think you run that through your pro-forma and you're roughly the same. The difference we're seeing on a lot of things that we're selling right now and why the IRR for us is lower in terms of the hold scenario and why we choose to sell it is a lot of older stuff. You saw that, we're selling 40 years old property and that have very high capital needs. And some of that has our ROI on it. Some of it, it's just preserving the asset. And, there may be a buyer that sees things differently, sees a little more upside. But in our case, we think the capital is better used elsewhere. So, in our eyes, it's probably a 7ish something or other, and we think that money can be redeployed better elsewhere. Eric Wolfe : Hi. It's Eric. Sorry to keep switching people on you. But, maybe just talking about coastal rent growth for a second. You talked about supply being in check, homeownership, very unaffordable, solid real wage growth, job growth, okay, maybe getting a little slower. But I guess the question is why aren't we seeing stronger rent growth today just given all of those positive dynamics? And is there anything that do you think in the future would turn it around such you see that sort of more than 3% type rent growth in those coastal markets. Mark J. Parrell: Hi, Eric, it's Mark. Just to start, the others can contribute. I mean, you look at the numbers in DC and Boston and New York last year were outstanding. So, we're being thoughtful. We're being a little cautious going into a volatile year, but your restatement of the setup is correct. I mean, those northeast markets have steady demand, by and large, minimal supply or in DC's case, strong absorption characteristics. I mean, we're optimistic those markets can continue to do well. In some cases, like New York, and Michael alluded to that, they're coming off really big rent growth years. In some cases, there's a little bit of a pause to catch your breath and let resident incomes grow to catch up to rental growth. But, I mean, if you didn't get that message, we're super optimistic about the northeast markets and think they will do very well. It's just trying to handicap all the various crosscurrents in the economy that are challenging for us. Eric Wolfe : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is going to come from Jeff Spector from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jeff Spector : Great. Thank you. My first question is a follow-up. I heard a comment and I think it was on the Sunbelt quote it could be a couple tough years. I guess can you expand on that? And then, and maybe most important is talk about when you expect supply pressure to peak, let's say, in Seattle. And I know, again, Sunbelt is, smaller markets for you. But if you have a view on the Sunbelt, it would be appreciated? Thank you. Michael L. Manelis: Yes. Hey, Jeff. This is Michael. So I'll start. And just specific to the Seattle and the supply that we see, it is back half loaded for us in the market with basically, a lot of concentration in Redmond as well as the city of Seattle. So for us, like, the peak is what we expect to experience is going to be somewhere in that back half of this year. And you could already see the starts coming way down. So, I think the level of competitive pressure that we face in \u201825 and Seattle will be less than what we're facing in \u201824. Relative to the Sunbelts, I mean, this is a great question because it's going to take a while to absorb the units that are coming to this market, and the supply that we look at is fairly constant across many of the Sunbelt markets all year long by quarter, which tells us that and what I said in the prepared remarks that we expect to feel this pressure at our assets all year long. I think as you turn the corner and you get into \u201825, you're going to start to see that supply number slow down, but you are still going to have a little bit of the overhang of the pressure from the units that were delivered to the market in \u201824. Mark J. Parrell: Yes. I'm just going to add a little bit to that. If you look at \u201825 expected deliveries and some stuff from \u201824 will definitely slip, I mean, it's about as big as \u201823\u2019s delivery. So, it's not like \u201825 is a, incredible decline. So, what we really see, Jeff, as we look at this is still good demand in those markets. That's why we like Dallas, Fort Worth, Denver, Austin and Atlanta. But the supply picture in our experience, we'll spend this whole year with declining new lease rates, occupancy pressure, all of those things, and you as an investor and an analyst may start to see improvement in that so called second derivative of rent growth late this year beginning of \u201825. But same store revenue growth in our experience will be worse in \u201825, not in \u201824 because all those leases that are being rewritten will go through the rent roll. And so you may be more optimistic in \u201825, but your numbers actually likely will be worse. So, that's what we've seen with supply in our history across our markets, and then we don't really see why it'd be any different here. And I think the wild card is if you have incredible job growth in these markets, you may be able to absorb some of this supply more efficiently and get through it more quickly. But the idea that \u201824 is the only oversupplied year is kind of a tough one for us to accept. Jeff Spector : Thank you. That's very helpful. And is that why you're assuming acquisitions in the second half or is that just conservative approach I guess to the guidance on acquisitions or to your point, are you really expecting these opportunities to arise more second half \u201825 in your expansion markets? Mark J. Parrell: Well, the guidance is just to help you model. If Alec, can buy things in his team earlier at good prices, we'll buy them earlier. The relationship I think you're going to see here is that prices now seem okay, maybe not quite good enough, but the discount to basis, the replacement cost, pardon me, is very good. It's the cap rate. And when you look at, like, two years of declining rental growth, you buy in Dallas, your year two number might be lower your cap rate than your year one. But on the other hand, later this year, you'll be past some of that and your year two number will look a little better. So, likely paying a higher price. So, that's what you're going to see us navigate. We like these markets long-term. We think owning the four markets that we've, tabbed as our expansion markets, say, 25% of the company will create more balance and drive growth better and reduce volatility over time, Jeff. But getting into them is a little bit of an art. There's going to be a little bit that we probably do sooner, a little bit we do later, and you may feel better about the price in one and not as good about the revenue growth in the other and vice versa. But, we're prepared to do that. And, again, the number you see there is just sort of the guidance assumption. We'd be happy to do more if we can find more. Jeff Spector : Thank you. Operator : And our next question is going to come from Robin Lu from Green Street. Please go ahead. Robin Lu : Good morning. I just want to touch on taxes. From your conversations with cities, are you hearing any markets where lower values are starting to flow through to tax assessments? Robert A. Garechana: Yes. Hi, Robin. It's Bob. Thanks for the question. We are seeing lower values in some markets. In fact, we've gotten some assessed values, actually back already, as we look at 2024. And on the margin, you are seeing some decreases. So for instance, in Washington state, we saw about a 1% decrease, and we've got most of the values back there, and we're seeing it in other places. Obviously the income, as assessors look at values, the income production in 2023 was really quite good. But the offset there was really the cap rate change just given risk free rates and other things. And so we are seeing some acknowledgment by assessors that values are in fact, lower than what they had initially assessed at. The open item as you think about real estate taxes for 2024 will be where rate comes. And we have rates in some places, and we'll see where they, fall out in others. Robin Lu : So, the magnitude of where values have fallen in, let's call it, the last couple of years haven't really fully been baked in yet. They're still sort of trickling into tax assessment. Is that how -- am I interpreting that correctly? Robert A. Garechana: You are correct, and that makes for an excellent appeal activity for our real estate tax team as we challenge values. Robin Lu : I'm glad it could help. Just on the second question. Robert A. Garechana: Thanks. Robin Lu : I did obviously notice that you, did some stock repurchases in the open market after a long period of a pause, with, I guess, little less system development and no near-term debt maturity, are you expecting or how does buybacks drive against other capital, uses this year, particularly on the way that you, the cadence between disposition and acquisitions for 2024? Mark J. Parrell: Hi, Robin, it's Mark. Thanks for that question. Our primary capital allocation goal is going to remain building out the portfolio in the way I just described in these expansion markets and lowering exposure in Washington DC, New York, and California. Again, we believe that portfolio will create the highest returns over time, the lowest volatility, that that'll make the shareholders the most money in the long haul. All that said, we're going to continue to consider these share buybacks, especially when you get this bigger value dislocation and when you can fund it with assets that are the least desirable, among the least desirable in the portfolio against the portfolio that we think is really top notch and where there isn't a lot to buy. That's an important other ingredient. There wasn't a lot of opportunity cost here, there wasn't a lot else available to buy at prices that made sense and all those capital structure considerations have to be thought about too. We've talked about on these calls. Things like, does it create a lot of tax gain that's hard for a REIT to manage. That worked out okay for us. Bob has done a great job and his team on the balance sheet, so I don't have to worry about debt maturities that we need to kind of husband our capital. And another I want to introduce is you got to be careful about platform scaling. If you sell too many assets, you can really increase your overhead as a percentage of revenue. But all that said, the Board and the management team remain open to buybacks. And for us, it's hard for me to give you a formula. We're just going to kind of see what market conditions are, where the stock goes, what's out there to buy, and, keep our mind open to doing more, stock buybacks. Robin Lu : Right. Thanks for the color. Operator : And our next question is going to come from Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Goldsmith : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. My first question kind of dovetails off of Jeff's one. If you kind of slice your portfolio between kind of core coastal, San Francisco and Seattle and then expansion markets, you talked quite a bit about just when you're expected to see the second derivative and basically how long it's going to take for the expansion markets to recover. Can you put some more context around San Francisco and Seattle, how that timeline compares? And if you're starting to see some of that second derivative recovery, now or expect to see it in the near future? Thanks. Mark J. Parrell: Hi, Michael, it's Mark, and I think, Michael Manelis may have something to add here. So, we talked a lot about San Francisco on the call, the last one and why we like the market long-term, feel the same way. The management team thinks there's going to be elongated recovery in that market. Conditions on the ground are a lot better. The mayor put out some information about crime reductions. They have the biggest class of police cadets, at the police academy in San Francisco, they've had since before the pandemic. So, there's some good things going on. But until, as Michael said, we get a little more tech job growth, which talking to the team and talking to others in the Bay area and in the city of San Francisco is probably a more later \u201824, \u201825 thing. That's probably where you get rent to take off. The thing I want you to think about is, you've had spectacular growth in incomes in the Bay area since 2019, over 30% nominal and 12% or 13% on a real basis, yet our rents are down in the city of San Francisco 20% since 2019 and kind of flattish to up marginally in the Bay area. So, this is a market that, like New York, can really take off once you get some job growth, because there isn't a lot of new supply. Housing costs are pretty high. So, the management team's optimistic about the recovery. The timing is kind of tough. I don't know, Michael, if you've got anything you want to add. Michael L. Manelis: Yes. I mean, I think we expect these markets to be volatile this year. And just starting off the year right now, I got both markets at 96%. Yes, we issued a lot of concessions in fourth quarter to get there, but the fact that we got there shows us there is demand in the marketplace. And as we think about even, like, the new lease change. So, both of those markets reported in December about a negative 8% new lease change. When you look at the January results, they're now both at about a negative 3.5%. So, it's a pretty material shift. So, the setup heading into the spring leasing season is really good, but we've been there before, and we've seen those markets kind of hit a pause and then kind of retrench a little bit. So, that's why we're just being a little cautious. We're going to wait till we see probably a couple consecutive quarters of improving fundamentals before we kind of change some of our long-term modeling on those markets. The other thing I would just add besides the value proposition of San Francisco is Seattle benefits from having, like, the lowest rent to income ratios out of all of our coastal markets. So, we just see this opportunity and the fundamentals for those markets to recover. It's just like Mark said, it's hard to pinpoint when. Mark J. Parrell: Yes. I forgot to mention something on Seattle I just want to throw out there. Seattle's nominal wage growth since 2019 is 40%, right. Yet our rents in that market are up 7%, and downtown, they're flat. So, again, these markets have the ability to pay more for great quality housing. And, again, Seattle is a supply, push this year, but after that, it gets a lot lighter. So, that's about a third of our portfolio, Seattle and San Francisco. And I hope, Michael, we're talking about that second derivative towards the end of this year for you, but we haven't embedded that into our guidance. Michael Goldsmith : Got it. Very helpful guys. And then my second question is just related to bad debt as a percentage of revenue, it was flat sequentially. I think there's an expectation that it could be choppy, but continue to trend down. So, what's assumed in guidance for 2024? And do you expect a continued slow and steady pace of improvement? Or should we expect that to kind of to get better in a specific quarter or just any sort of visibility around the pacing of improvement? Thank you. Robert A. Garechana: Yes. I'll grab that, Michael. It's Bob. So, to start with what's assumed in guidance, we do assume that we will get, we will improve. So, we ended the year at, call it, 1.4% of bad debt as a percentage of same store revenue. I think I said in my remarks, we expect to get to 1% a little over 1% for the full year. That means that by the fourth quarter, we're assuming that we're sub, 1%. You're correct in the kind of 3Q to 4Q in 2023 it being flattish, and what I would caution and is that it is, this is a thing that is very hard predict because of the court systems. It has puts and takes. There's more of a step function than a linear kind of improvement function associated with it. So, our expectations and guidance is that, Q1, which we're in right now is more flattish, and that you started see seeing improvement later in Q2, Q3, and Q4, because of that kind of case of the court system and because there is there's always been a little bit of seasonality in this number as you think about, like, post holidays, bad debt in the first quarter is always or typically a little bit higher anyways. So, expect it a little bit of a choppy step function, but expect improvement overall. Michael Goldsmith : Thank you very much. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is going to come from Jamie Feldman from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jamie Feldman : Great. Thank you, and, thanks for taking the question. So, I guess just thinking about your comments on Sunbelt versus coastal, you think about the assets you bought, last quarter, one year old, selling assets that are 40 years old. How much of your view on those markets is, tied to just the types of assets you own? At least if they're newer assets, are they in lease up where you meet, it means you have more concessions, more challenging to get, to get leased up. Is there some of that bias in the numbers you're putting out, or would you say, your view of what you're seeing in coastal is truly, a view across the markets? Mark J. Parrell: Yes. Thanks for that question, Jamie. I guess I attack it another way by certainly lease ups are different. But remember, the numbers we're telling you are same store numbers, so they won't include lease up conversations. But I would say we have relatively small portfolios in those markets. So, if one property is being hit hard, it could be one out of eight of our same store assets in, Denver. So, I think that is it. I think different people, obviously, different parts of the market feel it differently. So, that would be my comment. We have relatively small portfolios. I mean, Austin, we have three same store assets. Alexander Brackenridge : So, and, Jamie, this is Alec. I would just add, though. When you're in a market, though, that's got so much supply, and these are historic amounts, where concession levels start to get more than two months or, really excessive, I think everyone gets impacted, whether you're a B property or an A property. I can't see how you're immune, from some of that pressure. Jamie Feldman : Okay. That's very helpful. And then as we think about the investment market, I mean, clearly, the debt markets are coming back, pretty quickly. We've now seen some real estate M&A. So, I assume competition is going to get harder for the types of assets you'd like acquire in \u201824 and beyond. How do you think about the importance of just transitioning the portfolio, as soon as you can versus, really hitting that right number? Do you think maybe your underwriting assumptions have to loosen up a little bit just so you can achieve some of your strategic goals, over the next couple of years if the market gets more competitive. Mark J. Parrell: We'd love to move more quickly in completing our, repositioning. I don't feel any need to do that by selling assets cheap. I think you'll continue to see us, sell assets that are a little bit less desirable from our point of view. It's more about the difference, Jamie, between the sale and the buy, if we can sell things well, we can pay up a little bit on the buy side. And, again, we're creating that diversification we value. So, it's a little bit about if we're doing trading like that, it's going to depend on both the sale price and the buy price. To the extent we try and expand the company through debt activities, then the interest rate that Bob's borrowing at is going to become more relevant. So, I think right now would be somewhere in the name of where the 5% for 10 year money. So, I hope that's helpful, but we'd like to move faster. We point out that since 2019, when we started this, we've moved billions of dollars of capital into those markets, but the transaction markets have been closed for half of the last four and a half years because of COVID and because of the Fed. So, we're hopeful that in a wide open year, I mean, we did, I think, $1.7 billion back in \u201822. We're capable of doing $2 billion plus a year for sure. If the opportunities present themselves and we push the gas hard, it's got to make some sense. De minimis dilution is one thing. Wholesale dilution would require some sort of justification that, we could get on this call and you all would feel was compelling. Jamie Feldman : Okay. So, it sounds like it's more about the dilution than it is the absolute cap rate or the absolute IRR? Mark J. Parrell: We would accept some dilution to complete our strategic repositioning. The IRR matters. I mean, these deals got to make sense. We like owning newer assets because we'll have less capital. At the end of the day, the portfolios we'll own in Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, and Austin. We'll be the youngest portfolios of our REIT competitors. We think that's beneficial to our shareholders on the IRR CapEx side, not just on the NOI side. So, yes, we want to push the gas on this. We want to move this along. The IRR matters. The cap rate matters, dilution matters, but, getting it done matters a lot. Jamie Feldman : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : And our next question is going to come from Brad Heffern from RBC. Please go ahead. Brad Heffern : Yes. Hi, everybody. In the prepared comments, you mentioned some increased price sensitivity in New York late in the year. Can you add some color on that and talk about what gives you confidence to rank that market relatively high for 2024? Michael L. Manelis: Yes. Hi, Brad. This is Michael. So, I think in the prepared remarks, I was saying we saw just that the overall market level, there was what I would describe as just like rent fatigue where you started to see, certain types of units, one bedrooms, all of a sudden hit a price point at, like, $4,000. And it just kind of the activity level slowed. The renewal conversations became a little bit, more challenging. So, I would say we still expect pretty good growth out of New York in 2024. We're just saying we're tempering those expectations a little bit. The fundamentals there would all suggest that you have pretty good pricing power all year long because you have almost little to no competitive supply in Manhattan. You've got good demand drivers, in those markets, but I just think we're realistic that we've had two really good years of rent growth of rate growth that we're just kind of saying, okay. Let's just take a pause on that, and let's wait till the spring leasing season shows us, exactly what the market's willing to absorb. Brad Heffern : Okay. Got it. Thanks for that. And as a follow on to your earlier comments about wage growth on the West Coast versus where rent has gone. I guess, how much of that opens up an opportunity for future rent growth versus how much of that just reflects that those markets have become unaffordable before the downturn, and they've been, semi-permanently reprised? Mark J. Parrell: I guess we'll see. I our sense, again, from all our comments on San Francisco and Seattle is that they still are appealing places for our demographic to live that people will want to live in the center of those cities and the whole market and that, I don't know about some sort of wholesale repricing. And you saw New York recovered smartly on the rent side, and there's some deals going on in the investment sales market that would support New York trading at a lower cap rate as it historically has than the national average. So, I think the story is yet to be told on the West Coast markets because there's just no one selling, in the urban centers. But, I don't think, there's an answer to that, but I think the appeal of those centers is true and obvious and will come, and we've kind of given you our view of that. Brad Heffern : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question is going to come from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Alexander Goldfarb : Yes. Hi, good morning. So, two questions here. First, on the renewals, in addition to jobs, I guess renewals also seem to be a wild card. I realize there's a frictional cost to moving, especially in urban assets, but can you just walk through your views on renewal activity for this year. And it seems that you guys think it will hold up much better than new rents. And I'm sort of curious, I would think those same existing residents would see the new rates that, newcomers are getting in would want a rent reduction, not a rent increase? Michael L. Manelis: Yes, Alex. This is Michael. So, yes, I think it's a great question. And what I could tell you right now is that the quotes for the next 90 days have already been issued. We do expect to continue to renew about 55% to 60% of our residents, and achieve approximately anywhere between a 4% and 4.5% growth off of about 6% quotes that are out in the marketplace. You got to remember in the last couple of years, I mean, we put a lot of effort into this renewal process. We've centralized our renewal negotiations. That's really helped us navigate, the negotiation conversations with residents. We're leveraging all new processes in both the quote generation as well as the negotiations. We're layering in data science to help enhance some of these results. And right now, we do expect renewal performance to be fairly stable, but we have modeled for further deceleration, like, later in the year. So, the full year is expected to come in just over 4%, which is still a pretty solid growth, but we do expect to see some deceleration. And I think when you look at the spreads right now that you see in the markets with new lease change or market pricing and renewals. Sure, there's more stickiness when it comes to the renewals, and we have a lot of great rich history and data going all the way back to, like, 2006. That shows us that even when markets are dislocating, and I could use a San Francisco back in, like, 2016 where it was just getting a lot of new supply right on top of us. That market held up pretty well from the renewal standpoint and landed somewhere in that back half of the year with about 2% averages. So, it's not uncommon to see these spreads in the marketplaces. And the other thing, I guess, I would point out is we start getting into \u201824, our concession use was elevated back in \u201823. So, I can renew a lot of these residents flat in some of these expansion markets or Seattle and San Francisco and still walk away with a 6%, 8% increase on renewal. So, it kind of takes away some of the spread that you're looking at and why we have so much but in that renewal number being right around 4%. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. The second question sort of dovetails on the rent fatigue comments. It seems, I mean, using New York as an example, no new supply, people want to be back in the city, and we don't really hear stories anymore about doubling up or even moving to New Jersey is still an expensive proposition. So, from a pricing perspective, do you feel more comfortable today sort of across your portfolio, especially in markets like New York, in pushing pricing versus years ago when renters and I'm not just talking about new supply, but we're doubling up or maybe moving to New Jersey or outer boroughs or something was more of an option. Do you feel like you have more pricing power today to push rents more than historically? Michael L. Manelis: Yes. Alex, this is Michael. I'll start. Maybe somebody can layer on top of that. I think this is really a market and submarket kind of look. So, it really just depends as what is the spread, how much is Brooklyn's rent compared to Manhattan, what is that trade-off, decision to happen. So, I don't know that I'd say I have more pricing power today than I have had historically. I would say we have really good processes in place today that help us navigate through these situations. And each market is going to deliver different rate growth based on a whole lot of factors that go into the strengths of markets. And as we look for, 2024, all I can say is that the setup feels pretty good. Yes, it's like normal. The rents are doing what they seasonally should be doing, sequentially building each week. Our application volume is sequentially building each week. I think we need to see that momentum in that early part of the spring leasing season to really be able to answer that question and tell you, do I feel like I got more pricing power or less than historical times. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you. Operator : And our next question is going to come from Rich Anderson from Wedbush. Please go ahead. Rich Anderson : Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, on the topic of expansion markets, is it absolutely a fee simple type of investment? Or would you be open, given the sort of the complexity of all the lending environment and all that sort of stuff and some and distress balance sheet distress and whatnot. Would you be willing to invest, in different areas of the capital stack and with an intention to ultimately own? Or are you going to have enough opportunity to keep it simple and just go, through equity channels. Alexander Brackenridge : Hi, Rich. It's Alec. Well, we prefer simple if it's available, but if there's a good opportunity that would require us to participate elsewhere in the capital stack that would lead to us likely owning the property, we're wide open for that as well. So, I do think there's going to be a lot of fee simple stuff out there, though. So, we'll balance that out, but we're happy to talk to anyone that owns a while located apartment in the expansion markets, about any structures they have. Rich Anderson : Okay. Great. And then, if I could just sort of, ask the sort of a different question about, what you said, Mark, earlier about 2025 being a tougher year in the Sunbelt versus 2024. But then you said something like, but the second derivative might be thought to be better. I didn't quite understand that. So, maybe you can clarify that. But would you say, generally speaking that the Sunbelt sort of recovery process is maybe a year behind San Francisco and Seattle? Is that, like, does that sort of help define the condition that you see it today? Mark J. Parrell: Yes. Well, I'm going to say is just how we've seen things play out in our market. So, the first thing that you see is you start to see a decline in occupancy when you get all of this, when you get a lot supply or big demand drop or both. So, the markets you've seen competitors in the RealPage numbers sort of show declines in occupancy. That pressures owners to give concessions and lower face rate, and then that in turn eventually affects same store revenue, which is, of course, the interplay between occupancy rate, renewals, and the whole nine yards. And so, in when it reverses, the exact opposite happens. First, you start to see, I'm building my occupancy a little. As Michael spoke to Seattle and San Francisco, that gives you a little bit of confidence. So, now you're going to take away of your concessions, you're going to try to move rate up a little, especially in the spring leasing season, you're going to test that as that improves, and, eventually, that'll flow through to your same store revenue number. So, that's what I mean by that comment. So that this year, same store revenue might hold up better in a heavily supplied market or a demand challenged market because you're looking at a situation where your rents, you haven't rewritten every lease down yet. Rich Anderson : Right. Mark J. Parrell: But over the course of two years, you will. And in that process, that second year same store revenue number is often lower, But we're often telling you, hey, you know what? New lease is going up. We're feeling better in a market. And that's what I'm sort of expecting. We'll see how it goes, but my expectation is sometime in \u201825, folks will be talking about an improvement in some of those, I call it second derivative, but new lease rates, street rent numbers, and it isn't going to be dramatic right away, but it's sort of some solidification of that that's really built on occupancy starting to improve. So, again, you got all this supply. Our experience is it compounds. It gets worse before it gets better, and it just takes a little while to run through the entire P&L. Is that helpful, Rich? Rich Anderson : Yes. That's really helpful. Thanks. And then would you then sort of characterized Sunbelt as being X money months behind San Francisco, Seattle? Is it a year in your mind if you were to just sort of simplify it? Mark J. Parrell: I don't have a prediction on that. We told you we didn't put San Francisco and Seattle in this year's improvement bucket. I have high hopes, but it feels like because of supply in Seattle and just job conditions in San Francisco, it could take a little longer, and I think the Sunbelt is just starting its challenges. So, I think both areas will be a little challenged in \u201824. Rich Anderson : Okay, fair enough. Thanks very much. Operator : And our next caller is going to be John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. John Kim : Thank you. On your blended lease growth, improvement in January, can you comment on how you think this trends for the remainder of the quarter? I realize I expect it to improve in the second quarter. And if there's any discrepancies in the market performance versus what you had in the fourth quarter, as shown in Page 17 of your supplement? Michael L. Manelis: Yes. Hi, John. This is Michael. I could start with that. So, I mean, I think as you look at this and I cited before just the improvement that we saw in San Francisco and Seattle coming off of December and into January with the new lease trends going from, like, a minus 8% in December down to, like, the minus 3.5%? The portfolio itself was at minus 5.7% for new lease change in December and is now in January that we put in the release at a minus 3.7%, the expectations clearly is that you could see with sequential rents improving each week, that number is going to continue to drop, as you work your way through the quarter. So, on the renewal side, it's a little bit of the opposite story. You saw renewals were a 5.2% in the month of December, and in the release, we have January at the 4.9%. The quotes are out there, but we do expect this renewal number to keep trending down as we work our way through. Somewhere in that 4% to 4.5% range is what we expect to achieve off the quotes that are in the marketplace. So, I think you're going to see the interplay between these to shift a little bit where you're going to have strength because you're going to have new lease change starting to recover and hopefully turning positive as we start off the spring leasing season, and we'll see if we keep this kind of momentum in place to do that, and you'll see the moderation of renewals, but still at a really strong number if we come in anywhere between that 4% and 4.5% growth. John Kim : Okay. And my second question is on, your development yields. Like you said, we're trending closer to 6%, given higher concessions. Can you comment on the level of concessions that you're providing today? And if, is this really driven by your Texas and Denver developments, or is this broad based? Alexander Brackenridge : Hi, John. It's Alec. Well, we are literally just starting up our lease ups right now, so we don't have a lot of data yet. We are assuming a month right now, but that could be flexible over time. And, those lease ups are three in Texas, one in suburban New York, which will probably see very little, of that kind of concessions, and then, two in Denver. John Kim : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question is going to come from Adam Kramer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Adam Kramer : Hi. Yes, maybe a little bit more of conceptual question and I guess also kind of in-line with Alex Goldfarb's question earlier. But just looking at kind of the new lease change by market, comparing that to the renewal change by market, it's kind of interesting that new lease can vary pretty by some of these markets, but renewals are in a pretty tight band, call it 200 basis point band give or take. And so I guess the question is kind of twofold, right? Is there an ability to maybe push renewals even more And say a market like DC where new lease is holding in a lot better versus kind of expansion markets, right or San Francisco where I guess I'm kind of surprised by that historically widespread between the new and the renewal rate. And should I be maybe a little bit worried about renewals kind of falling a little bit, getting closer to that kind of deeply negative or somewhat negative new lease change? Again, a little bit more of a conceptual question, so apologies, but hopefully that makes sense. Michael L. Manelis: Yes. Hi, Adam. It's Michael. So, I mean, I think there's just more stickiness into the renewal stats that you look at this. And you're also coming off of a period of time, which is low transactions. So, there is a little bit of that in these numbers. I think as we think about this I mean, like I said, we have this data going all the way back in time. It's just not uncommon in the fourth quarter to see new lease change goes negative even in a pretty good year with rate growth happening in the marketplace. That new lease change goes negative and renewals stay positive. So, it is a really uncommon situation for our renewal growth to go flat or even think that it's going to be negative. And like I said, we've just put so much into our processes. We have so much good information and insights to it. We got a high degree of confidence. That being said, if there's a big dislocation in the market, right, even the deceleration I mentioned before could be more robust than what we've modeled. Adam Kramer : Great. Thanks. That's really helpful and I appreciate that color, and all of kind of the building blocks earlier on the call too. So, maybe on concession usage, I know you've talked about it a little bit on the call thus far, maybe just if you don't mind just some of your expansion markets, kind of the level of concessions in terms of number of weeks that are being offered? Mark J. Parrell: Yes. So, I think I would just start by just saying that the concession use right now remains concentrated in the Seattle and San Francisco portfolio for us with about 70% of all the concessions being issued. When you drill into the expansion markets, I mean, it's such a small percent of the absolute portfolio. But right now, when you go across them, it's running between, like, 30% and 45% of applications receiving about a month. I'd say Dallas right now is the one market where we're up closer to about six weeks, worth of concessions being issued. And like I said, we would expect that to kind of continue at that level in those expansion markets, and we're watching what's going to be happening with the new lease ups and how competitive are they so that we know where we need to play. The fact that these markets are now, like, 96% or even some of them over 96% with that concession use that we did in the fourth quarter is really a good sign, because the last thing you want to do is turn on concessions, do leasing, and still land at an occupancy like where you started with. That would not be a good situation. So, we feel like the setup right now is defensive. These occupancies are 2% to 3% above. We expect to issue 30% to 40% of our applications receiving concessions of a month to a month and a half in those markets. Adam Kramer : Great. Thanks so much for the time. Operator : And our next question is going to come from Haendel St. Juste. Please go ahead. Haendel St. Juste : Hi, good, I guess, good morning out there to you guys. Mark, I guess the, first question for you, following up on Rich's question earlier about your potential interest in stepping in and participating in other parts of the capital stack, seems a bit of a departure from how you responded to this the Mez Investments in the past. So I guess, first, is that fair and why the change of heart? I'm assuming perhaps it's reflective of the opportunities. But second, I'm assuming or is it fair to assume that you'd be solely focused on the Sunbelt. And then third, what level of return or premium to acquisition cap rates would you seek there? Thanks. Mark J. Parrell: Okay. I\u2019m going to start with some of that and then Alec may answer parts of it as well, Haendel, but on the Mez Investment side, I think the part that Alec emphasized was the path to ownership. So, what we've been more hesitant to participate in is to just create a book where we are consistently making mezzanine loans or preferred equity investments in deals where it's improbable that we would end up being the owner. When we're working with the lender and the owner and we get in the capital structure and there's a good chance we're going to end up with the deal. That, to us, is very different. That is stuff we did do back in \u201808 or \u201809 through 2010. So, that is a familiar thing for me and Alec and a lot of folks on the team to do. So, that's how I would distinguish the two of those. I don't know if there was anything else in that question you wanted to answer, Alec. No? Alexander Brackenridge : No. I think we're good. I mean, we will be opportunistic, though. It's free of our company, and we'll keep looking for, chances to buy great real estate. Mark J. Parrell: I guess I will, you asked about acquiring assets in one form or another in our established coastal markets, we're certainly open to that. We've got some development deals. We're likely to start in some of those established markets that are in areas really hard to build. But the primary focus is to get into these expansion markets and add capital there. Haendel St. Juste : Got you. That's helpful. But a follow-up, what level of return potentially would you or premium, to acquisitions would you seek were you to get involved in, some of these Mez or path to ownership type opportunities? Alexander Brackenridge : Hi, Haendel. It's Alec. It\u2019s really impossible to peg that without knowing the specifics of the deal and the circumstances around it. But, obviously, we're very focused on getting compensated for any risk would take beyond a typical transaction. Haendel St. Juste : Okay. Fair enough. One more on the expense side. I was hoping for a bit more detail on the key components, appreciate the overall, high level thoughts you provided there earlier, but maybe some specifics on the key components like, what you're embedding in your guide for specifically taxes, insurance, R&M, and also for the ongoing tech initiatives. I think last year, you outlined $10 million or so of savings via that. I'm just curious what level perhaps we could see from tech savings this year? Thanks. Robert A. Garechana: Yes. Hi, Haendel, it's Bob. I'll start with some detail on the expenses and then maybe pass it to Michael on the initiatives. I will caveat on the initiative side. Most of our initiatives, as Michael mentioned, are more revenue focused this year than expense focused, but he can touch on, initiatives if I don't cover something. So, on specifics related to some of the categories, we are expecting, as I kind of mentioned, utilities and real estate tax to grow higher than what they did in 2023. That implies or means that at the midpoint, we'd have real estate taxes around, call it a 3%, and utilities more around a 6% growth rate relative to what were, lower growth rates in \u201823. On the other side of the equation on the big categories, you have R&M, which experienced a lot of inflationary pressure in 2023. We expect that to normalize. So we expect, R&M to grow something more like 4%. That is where we are realizing some of the opportunities and, work that we've done on the initiative front to reduce our dependency on contract labor and places where there's wage pressure. So, that's helping us get to that 4%, anticipated growth. And payroll, we think, we're not anticipating as much, challenges on the medical benefit side, and we're just yielding some of the, payroll optimization we did was back end loaded in \u201823, so we'll realize more of that benefit in 2024. Does that help you on the color side? Is there any categories I missed? Haendel St. Juste : No. That's helpful. But in relation to I believe it was $10 million that you outlined last year from tech driven efficiencies, first, is that accurate? And second, do you have a comparable figure expectation for this year? Michael L. Manelis: Yes. Hi, Haendel. It's Michael. So, let me just start by saying, that really the entire company has been focused around these innovation initiatives for the last several years, and we now have created this foundation that really is going to deliver long-term value creation of the portfolio for many years to come. With the materials that we put in that November investor presentation highlights this technology evolution of this platform, really has been focused on creating the mobility and efficiency in the operating model while the seamless experience to our customer improves. All in, we've identified about $60 million in NOI improvements with about $35 million of that already achieved over the past several years. The early stages of this was clearly more expense focused, and that shows up in our numbers when you look at the low expense growth. And that's mostly in the payroll and some of the R&M accounts over the last couple of years. Going forward, we've identified and we expect about another $25 million. In 2023, we delivered about $10 million in NOI improvement, and about two-thirds of that was on the expense categories, primarily in the payroll accounts, and a couple of million dollars of that was in the revenue front. Specific to 2024, we've layered in another $10 million included in guidance with about $7.5 million in other income accounts. And this is realized growth as the annualized number from all of these initiatives is greater because some of these are back half loaded, meaning I only get about half of the benefit this year. So, overall, I guess, I would just say is this operating foundation is almost in place, and you really should expect that the future years are going to continue to have more revenue enhancement opportunities. But the reality is, I mean, we're never really done with this pursuit of operational excellence. It's something that's wired into the DNA of our company, and I'm sure as this year goes on, we're going to identify new things for future years as well. Haendel St. Juste : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is going to come from Rob Stevenson from Janney. Please go ahead. Rob Stevenson : Good morning, guys. Alec, can you talk about how robust the market is for dispositions in quality of life areas like urban Seattle, San Francisco or markets with ongoing bad debt issues like LA, are things trading and where are they pricing versus a few years ago if they are? Alexander Brackenridge : Yes. Thanks, Rob. It's Alec. There's almost no activity in the markets listed. I mean, we're we test from time-to-time. Not saying we wouldn't sell something, but right now, I don't, I couldn't tell you what market cap rates are because they just haven't been frayed. So, it is really frozen there. So frankly, we've concentrated our efforts elsewhere. Rob Stevenson : And I mean, is that just hold-on for a couple of years, hope that the cities get their act together, or is there something else just simply buy lower price capital that will allow that to sort of come back or are there you anticipating some sort of level of permanent impairment on some of those markets and submarkets? Alexander Brackenridge : No, I think all of the things that you mentioned are likely to happen. There is a tremendous amount of capital on the sidelines. These cities are still great cities. The cities themselves are doing a lot, particularly in San Francisco and Seattle to improve the quality of life. I mean, they're making some really serious headways. And as Mark, talked about, we expect them to recover as the jobs recover. But even absent that, we're at 96% occupancy. It's just investors sentiment's really negative right now, and, we think that there are better opportunities elsewhere, and we're frankly a buyer of what it sounds like people would transact right now. Mark J. Parrell: And, Rob, just to add to that. I mean, these markets, Seattle and San Francisco, particularly though, you could think about downtown LA too. We may have powerful drivers. For us, it's like we talked about New York when everyone was down on New York City, and we were positive on it still. That recovery has been vibrant. I think it's the same pattern here. It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when, and I think these markets will recover greatly on the rental side over the next few years. What we shied away from on this call is, excessive enthusiasm too early in the year when you're not really into the leasing season yet, in markets that do have volatility associated with them. So, I don't feel any sense of permanent impairment in these markets at all. I think that you're going to have great rental growth. You're going to have a recovery that's pretty strong in these markets. And you are likely, but not certain to follow a pattern like in New York, where again, the sales market has some deals in it in New York, and they're trading really well. And so, I'm not sure why in a few years, San Francisco and Seattle wouldn't trade very well as well, but it's just going to take some time. And, again, our hesitancy here is really around the timeline for this, not the occurrence of it. And I think it's a catalyst for our investors. I think having, a portion of the portfolio and unrecovered markets with rents lower than they were in \u201819 and incomes a lot higher is a huge potential piece of kindling wood to our earnings in future years. Rob Stevenson : Okay, that's helpful. And then lastly for me, Bob, what's the $0.06 difference between day REIT and normalized FFO guidance? Is that one or two large items that you're expecting or a bunch of small ones given what you know today? Robert A. Garechana: Yes. There's one larger contributor which I'll talk about, which is, advocacy costs. So, we are forecasting higher levels of advocacy the cost in 2024, given that it's an election year and some of the ballot sheet, ballot initiatives, sorry, that we are facing, which is not atypical as in other election years. And then the remaining pieces are typical forecast for pursuit costs and other items. Rob Stevenson : Is that advocacy in California or is there other markets as well or is that entire spend out there? Robert A. Garechana: It's predominantly California. Rob Stevenson : Okay. And is there anything, I guess, related to that that you're especially worried about this cycle? I mean, I know that a lot of this stuff keeps being put on every other ballot or every ballot, but I mean is there anything that's looking like this year or 2024 is the chance that it really passes, it would wind up being a negative for you guys? Mark J. Parrell: Rob, it's Mark. I mean, there's negatives and there's positives in the regulatory area. The ballot measure is by far the biggest point of focus in the industry. And just to remind everyone, this has been on the ballot twice before. The citizens of California rejected it by 20 percentage points each time. The industry is well organized. We're going to make the same good arguments about supply being the solution, more rental voucher funding being the solution. And to be honest, the Governor Newsom and the legislature have done a lot of supply things with the accessory dwelling unit legislation, with some of the zoning reforms. And so to be honest, when I turn to the positive on the regulatory side, people would hear us. They hear the industry's point about supply, about zoning reform. Governor DeSantis, obviously, couldn't be more different than Governor Newsom. He has done some great things in Florida as it relates to housing policy as well and zoning reform to allow more affordable housing to be built. Governor Hochul in New York was trying the same thing and got a lot of resistance, but we hope that is still in place. So California is, to answer your question, the focal point of us in the industry at large this year. But markets like New York and, Massachusetts and Colorado, there's always dialogue going on in those markets, but we're well organized to have that conversation. And I think policymakers, by and large, understand that supplies the answer, not rental regulation. That's what I think is the positive here. You hear about that a lot more in our conversations, and the reaction to rent control is, something that we talk through and, you get a lot of people calling the other direction after they've heard the arguments. Rob Stevenson : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks guys. Appreciate the time. Mark J. Parrell: Thank you. Operator : And our next question is going to come Anthony Powell. Please go ahead. Anthony Powell : Hi. Good morning. A question on new and renewal lease spreads and the leases. I'm curious, what's the absolute, I guess, rent these two group consultants are paying in terms of both gross and net effective? I'm trying to understand better about what, the actual numbers are from these two, customer groups? Michael L. Manelis: Hi, Anthony. This is Michael. Can you ask that again? I'm not sure I'm following the absolute rent part of the equation. Anthony Powell : Yes. So, in terms of this new renewal leases, absolute rent, is there a big difference between the two? Are customers paying, lower or higher of renewing new leases? I'm trying to get a sense of the absolute pricing difference between the two groups of customers. Michael L. Manelis: Yes. I think when you look at it on the new lease side because of the concessions that we're offering in some of them, I think it lowers, like, the net effective rate when you look at the absolute average of all the leases that we wrote versus the renewals. Robert A. Garechana: And one thing to keep in mind, too, Anthony, is when you're looking at the spread so if you're starting with market rate rents, right, and looking at market and that's kind of your pricing trend or whatever. Spreads can vary materially depending on who is in the mix of, moving in and moving out. So, if I have lived in a unit for one year and got a big concession, as Michael used an example, in an expansion market, and I happen to be the one renewing, then that spread can be very different than the absolute. So, just keep that in mind, as you look at any of these spreads. And then particularly keep it in mind as you think about seasonal periods, like the first quarter and the fourth quarter where transaction activity is really low. You can have even more volatility in the number. Anthony Powell : All right. Thank you. And maybe one more on transaction activity. Do you expect to see any portfolio deals, later this year? Or do you expect your deal activity to be more single asset as we had been recently? Alexander Brackenridge : Anthony, it's Alec. I don't know if I expect to. I certainly hope to and I think we probably will, but it remains to be seen. But there's some things out there that we've heard about that might be interesting, and we'll certainly be very actively pursuing them. Anthony Powell : Thank you. Alexander Brackenridge : Thank you. Operator : And our next question is going to come from Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Linda Tsai : Hi. Thank you. Just one question. In your prepared comments, you highlighted seeing stability and pullback in Seattle and San Francisco. Could you discuss that dynamic more? Is this volatility associated with job loss and return to work mandates or maybe just provide some examples of what drives this push and pull? Michael L. Manelis: Yes. Hi, Linda. This is Michael. So, I think clearly job growth is one of the catalysts that does that. The migration patterns also influence that. So, where you see a lot more of your move-ins coming to you from within the MSA, that's usually deal seekers. Those are people that are responding to see in the concessions and either breaking their lease where they were to move into it. So, it just you just haven't seen, like, the sustained momentum that you would expect based on seasonal trends. I think last year, you saw some of those layoff announcements. You saw a lot of ambiguity around return to office where people were just waiting to see what their employer was going to do, before they decided to make any kind of relocation decisions to get nearer into where their offices were. I still think some of that exists in the marketplace today. But what we did see and what we see right now is that the setup in both of those markets has positioned us with good occupancy. We are starting to pull back concessions. The marketplace, still has concessions in them, and we'll just watch and see that build as we get in towards March and April to see what pricing power really looks like. But there's a lot of factors that are going into why a market all of a sudden kind of stalls out and whether or not it shows you sustained momentum more in-line with seasonal trends. Linda Tsai : Thank you. Operator : And I have no further questions left in the queue. I'll turn it back over to Mark Parrell for closing comments. Mark J. Parrell: Thank you all for hanging in there on this long call. We appreciate your, interest and your time today. Good day. Operator : And this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Thank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our first quarter 2024 results and outlook for the year. I will start us off, then Michael Manelis, our COO, will speak to our operating performance and how we see 2024 operations playing out. And then we will take your questions. We are pleased with our first quarter performance, which was ahead of January expectations and reflects the strong demand for the lifestyle our well-located apartment properties provide as well as little new competitive supply across most of our established markets. Our same-store revenues increased 4.1% in the quarter, and our same-store expenses rose only 1.3%, which led to same-store NOI growth of 5.5% and an increase in our NFFO per share of 6.9%. So overall, a very solid start to the year across all categories, with the company well positioned to capture increasing seasonal demand as we head into our prime leasing season. As is our practice, we have not revised our operating or FFO guidance, and we'll make adjustments as we get deeper into our primary leasing season. Digging under the hood a bit, the durability of the employment picture for our target affluent renter demographic is a continuing bright spot in our business as is the cost of owned housing. Unemployment for the college educated, a very sizable percentage of our residents, remains at around 2%, considerably lower than the overall average, supporting demand. This demographic, which is well employed in the growth engines of our economy, including technology, financial services and other professional and business services, continues to grow in both our established and expansion markets. We also see a little competition from owned housing as the high cost of homes, combined with elevated financing costs and rapidly rising insurance, real estate tax and maintenance costs combine to make rental housing a very attractive option for many people. Social factors that we've discussed on prior calls like smaller households and delayed marriage and childbearing add to the attractiveness of rental housing. In the quarter just ended, the percentage of our residents leaving us to buy homes was 7.8%, a continuation of all-time lows. Strong demand and high single-family housing costs are consistent conditions across both our coastal established markets that represent 95% of our company's NOI and our new expansion markets of Dallas-Fort Worth, Atlanta, Denver and Austin, that collectively represent 5% of our NOI. But on the apartment supply side, we see 2 very different pictures playing out in our established coastal markets versus our expansion markets. With the exception of Seattle and Central D.C. in our established coastal markets, we see the terrific demand I just mentioned being met with generally little new supply, leading to solid rent growth. Across our 4 expansion markets, we see robust demand as well, but it is being met by an overwhelming wave of new supply, leading to declining rent levels, high concessions and occupancy pressure. We expect this pressure to accelerate as units continue to deliver in these oversupplied markets, especially once the prime leasing season concludes and demand seasonally declines. Switching to expenses, Michael is going to go over all that with you in a moment. But I wanted to take a second to thank our teams across the company for their amazing work on expense management. We are very pleased to have produced a sector-leading 3.1% average growth rate of same-store expenses over the last 5 years. Our teams have embraced innovation and a customer service mindset and are not afraid of change, and it shows in these numbers. Well done, team. On the investment side, we are seeing properties that we would be interested in acquiring, well-located newer properties in our expansion markets in the suburbs of Seattle and Boston trade at high prices and in very low volume compared to pre-pandemic levels. Investment sales activity in the first quarter was over 60% below average pre-pandemic levels. Estimates from my colleagues who attended the recent ULI conference indicate that there is over $200 billion of dry powder looking to invest in North American real estate, with a significant portion focused on apartments. Recent data points from the pending AIRC transaction and apartment portfolio and one-off deals are similarly supportive of much higher values than the public market is currently suggesting. While this is a huge positive signal about the underlying value of our company, it has slowed our portfolio rebalancing efforts. And while pricing in most of the apartment transaction market is strong, buyer interest is not yet fully evident for some of the large urban West Coast assets that we want to dispose of as part of our strategic rebalancing. We expect that to change as these submarkets continue to show improved operations and better quality of life conditions. In the meantime, with the lack of actionable acquisition opportunities, we saw value in our own stock. So we continue to strategically deploy disposition proceeds from the sale of older inferior properties in our portfolio into repurchases of our stock. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately $38.5 million of our own common shares at a weighted average share price of about $59 per share. Since we began this activity in the fourth quarter of 2023, we have repurchased approximately $87.5 million of our shares in what we see as an attractive valuation level of a bit below $58 per share. We are using the remaining disposition dollars to drive down our already low leverage, which will create more internal debt dry powder for when opportunities do emerge. We are going to continue to be disciplined in our transaction activities with a focus on growing cash flow over the long term. With regard to external growth, we are on track to deliver 6 newly completed joint venture developments in 2024. These 6 properties, 3 located in Dallas-Fort Worth, 2 located in Denver and 1 located in suburban New York, will be delivered at a weighted average stabilized yield north of 6% and will contribute meaningfully to our normalized FFO starting in 2025 given their completion and lease-up timing. The 3 Dallas-Fort Worth developments are the first completed projects to come out of our partnership with Toll Brothers. With some of the other equity residential executives, I recently visited all 6 of these development projects, and I'm inspired by the enthusiasm on display from our lease-up teams and excited about adding these high-quality assets to our portfolio. Before I turn it over to Michael, I wanted to make a quick comment on the new housing laws that were passed over the weekend in New York, though I know we are still digesting the law and its implications. The law allows for renewal increases of CPI plus 5% up to 10%, and provides for vacancy decontrol on the types of units we generally own in New York, which allows rents to move to market when a new resident moves in, and that's similar to the rent laws that were passed a few years ago in California. Overall, new price controls on an already undersupplied good, in this case, rental housing, is not an effective way to attract private capital to help solve the housing supply problem in New York State. However, there are also tax incentives in the new law for new rental construction subject to a new higher wage scale required for labor on larger buildings as well as permanent affordability rules. There are also some language on zoning reforms and some rules that aim to make office-to-residential conversions easier. While the rent control provisions are not helpful, we commend the governor and the legislature for focusing on a supply-based solution similar to recent legislation passed in such politically disparate states as Florida and California. We think focusing on supply, not heavy-handed regulation, has been recognized on both sides of the aisle as the long-term solution. While the new law adds to the complexity of operating in New York, a good portion of our portfolio in New York City is exempt either due to being built during or after 2009 or meeting the luxury exemption thresholds. We'll be happy to discuss all this further in Q&A. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael Manelis. Michael Manelis : Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This morning, I will review our first quarter 2024 operating performance and our positioning as we start the leasing season. We're off to a very good start thus far. As Mark mentioned, demand remains good across all of our markets, supported by a continuing solid job market and high employment in our affluent renter target demographic. One of the real highlights of the quarter was our turnover, which is the lowest we have ever seen. Our focus on customer satisfaction, harnessing data and leveraging our centralized renewal team to drive results is definitely having an impact here. In the first quarter, we renewed more than 61% of our residents, which is one of the highest percentages that we have seen. A special shout-out to New York, Boston and Seattle, who set their own high marks and greatly contributed to this result. Our first quarter same-store revenue growth exceeded our original expectations, including very good performance in San Francisco and Seattle, which I will discuss in a moment. This positions us very well for the year, but we acknowledge that this is just the beginning of a critical primary leasing season. Our efforts to build occupancy in the fourth quarter of 2023, coupled with continued strong demand and high resident retention, have resulted in both slightly above average rent growth since the beginning of the year and a 50-basis point quarterly sequential gain in physical occupancy. At 96.5% occupied this month, which is one of our highest reported occupancies in April, we have a lot of confidence that we will be able to continue to grow rates through the leasing season. The high percentage of residents renewing that I previously mentioned is also a big factor in this strength. In terms of market same-store revenue growth, the East Coast markets in Southern California are producing leading growth, as we expected, with San Francisco, Seattle and the expansion markets following in that order. As we think about these markets' performance relative to our expectations, New York and Washington, D.C. are running ahead of expectations, while Boston and Southern California and the expansion markets are in line. San Francisco and Seattle are also running ahead, but remember, these markets have been historically volatile. So we remain cautiously optimistic that we will hold on to the gains in these markets for the remainder of the year. Now a little more color on the individual markets before closing out with expenses and commentary in other income and initiatives. Starting in Boston, year-to-date revenue performance is in line with the expectations. City of Boston is currently 97% occupied and we have very little competitive supply to deal with. Concession use is little to none in this market. And overall, we continue to expect Boston to deliver some of the best full year revenue growth in the portfolio. As I mentioned, New York is performing well, with both strong demand and pricing power. The market is over 97% occupied and has very little competitive new supply. So far, we seem to have moved past the rent fatigue we saw in the market in late 2023 and expect good things from this market in '24. Hats off to Washington, D.C. as this market is outperforming our revenue growth expectations even after a strong 2023. We're benefiting from a very solid employment picture here, particularly in the defense sector which is driving consistent, stable high occupancy and real strength in our retention. We see good results across the whole market, but The District has recently begun lagging our suburban assets, likely due to nearby supply. Overall, we still expect Washington, D.C. to deliver a good amount of new supply in 2024 with nearly 13,000 competitive units. So we do anticipate the pressure to continue to grow as the year progresses. In Los Angeles, we see good demand, but not a lot of pricing power at the moment due to the additional units being brought back to the market through the eviction process. Our portfolio is 96% occupied, and we continue to make progress on the delinquency and bad debt situation, which should be a tailwind for growth in 2024. Time frames for processing evictions have recently improved from 9 months to 6 months, which should help us make more progress going forward. But they still do remain nearly twice as long as they used to be. That being said, we are very encouraged by the recent improvement. Rounding out the rest of Southern California, San Diego and Orange County are continuing to be very strong performers. The general lack of housing is keeping occupancies high. Home ownership costs are also high here, which makes renting in these markets the more attractive option. San Diego will see more competitive new supply in 2024, while Orange County will see similar amounts to last year, with limited pressure at a few of our Irvine locations. Now for the markets that may be of most interest : San Francisco, Seattle and the expansion markets of Dallas-Fort Worth, Denver, Atlanta and Austin. For the 2 West Coast markets, remember that we entered the year with relatively modest expectations but potential for upside. So far both markets are doing better than we expected, but it's early and both remain show-me stories as we saw periods of stability and pullback in 2023. In San Francisco, we are well occupied but would like to see continued improvements in pricing power. The South Bay, East Bay and Peninsula continue to perform better than our Downtown portfolio. The situation here remains the same as the market lacks the catalysts, either job growth or more robust return-to-office policies, to create true pricing power. Concessions remain prevalent in the Downtown submarket, but are being issued at a lower rate than they were in the fourth quarter, consistent with what you would seasonally expect. In Seattle, we carried strength from December into the early part of the year, leading to improved occupancy and the ability to move up rental rates, which is evident in our new lease growth for the quarter. That being said, we do expect a fair amount of competitive new supply in the market in 2024, which could temper growth. The East Side is performing better than the City of Seattle, and our Redmond assets are performing very well despite having some direct pressure from a new lease-up. Overall, the downtowns of both markets are showing real improvement in the quality of life, and the local political situation continues to get much more constructive as a focus on bringing these cities back to the thriving environments they were prior to the pandemic remains front and center with both policymakers and citizens. Recent primary elections in San Francisco were very encouraging as voters supported candidates who are focused on addressing safety and the quality-of-life challenges. Finally, some commentary on our expansion markets. Strong demand and a favorable regulatory environment continue to confirm our positive long-term outlook for these markets. Unfortunately, however, in the near term, we are seeing the pressures from high levels of new supply being delivered in 2024. Market occupancies are lower than our established markets and concessions are prevalent. So far, concession usage at stabilized asset properties in Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth and Denver are running at about 30% of applicants getting about 4 to 6 weeks. And in Austin, it's 60% of applicants getting about 6 weeks. Operating conditions are challenging across all of these markets, but Dallas appears to be more resilient, followed by Denver, Atlanta and then Austin. The job growth numbers in both Austin and Dallas are some of the highest in the country, which is clearly aiding in the absorption of some of the new supply. But the volume of deliveries is high and going to continue to grow throughout the year. With regards to bad debt and delinquency, the first quarter results were in line with our expectations. As I mentioned, we continue to see improvements in the time it is taking to process evictions in L.A., which is where the majority of our delinquent residents are, which is resulting in a decrease in the number of long-standing delinquent residents that we have. This is an encouraging sign and continues to support our view that we will see overall improvement in bad debt net contribute 30 basis points to our same-store revenue for the full year. Now let me hit on some highlights on expenses. Our 1.3% growth in the quarter was better than expected and driven by a decrease in both utilities and repairs and maintenance, coupled with pretty flat on-site payroll expense growth. On the utility expense, we primarily benefited from lower commodity pricing. We also intend to take advantage of federal and local incentive programs to continue to accelerate our sustainability efforts and moderate future utility growth. For example, we have 26 future solar installations planned, in addition to our 55 active systems, which will help reduce our future overall assumption. Our repairs and maintenance expense decrease was driven primarily by lower turnover costs and, to a lesser degree, maintenance expense, which was unusually elevated in the prior year. Once again, our disciplined approach to expense management has continued to pay off. On the innovation front, as we have previously discussed, we will be focused on a number of initiatives to drive both revenue growth and operating efficiencies. Specific to other income, our expectation remains unchanged that this will be a contributor of 30 basis points to our full year same-store revenue growth. During the quarter, we delivered 60 basis points, which was slightly ahead of our original expectations and mostly due to faster implementation of our parking revenue optimization program. In addition to our efforts around other income, we have been very focused on areas of opportunity like leveraging artificial intelligence into our business process. As early adopters of these AI interactions, we are thrilled with the performance of these tools. Over the past year, our AI leasing assistant, Ella, has engaged with just over 600,000 customer inquiries, set 2 million responses addressing prospect questions, and booked over 80,000 appointments. Leveraging this type of automation at the top of our demand funnel has been incredibly effective, allowing us to be nimble with increasing initial traffic demand without impacting our remaining on-site employees' ability to provide high-touch customer interactions when needed. We're excited to share that in the coming quarter we will begin testing an AI resident assistant, helping existing residents 24/7 with common questions about their community service and even their account statements. I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to innovation and enhancing customer service. As we sit here today, we're 96.5% occupied and continue to see strength in our renewal process, which positions us very well to capture the pricing power opportunities that the peak leasing season will bring. With that, I turn it over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Eric Wolfe with Citi. Eric Wolfe : If I look at your April new lease growth of 0.1% versus the 1.6% at this time last year, I'm just trying to understand why it's a bit lower given you're in a better occupancy position. I think you said record retention, record low turnover. So just wondering if we could see that catch up over the next couple of months. Michael Manelis : Eric, this is Michael. So yes, I think one of the things you need to remember is that, relative to the first quarter in 2023, we are issuing more concessions right now. So that does impact a little bit of what you see in that new lease change. But clearly, when you just think about the normal rent seasonality curve, pricing trend or asking rents in the marketplace, we're seeing that sequentially build. And you're seeing that sequential improvement in kind of the new lease stats for April over March. So I think what you should expect for the next several months working our way probably even through the middle of the third quarter is that we will sequentially build new lease change up, and we will see that stability in kind of the renewal, achieved renewal increase performance. So you're right to call out that it's a little lower than norm, but right now we like the sequential improvement that we're seeing. Eric Wolfe : All right. That's helpful. And then to your point on concessions, if we look at SF and Seattle, specifically, can you maybe talk about where concession usage is today versus, say, this time last year and if you're planning to dial that back further as we get into the peak leasing season? Michael Manelis : Yes. And I think I called this out even on the first -- or the call in January, that we made a strategic decision to increase the concession use, build up that occupancy in the fourth quarter, and really have been just pulling back the concession use as we worked our way through the first quarter. The most pronounced reduction actually came out of San Francisco. I think the offset to that reduction is that we also started to utilize some concessions in LA. So when you think about the sequential change from the fourth quarter through the first quarter, our concession use ticked down a little bit but not as much as what it would have been if we didn't start increasing some of the usage in the L.A. market.  Right now, about 50% of the concessions that we're using are concentrated in Seattle and San Francisco, with a large majority of those sitting in those downtown areas. Both of those markets are below where they were in January. And I'll tell you, we've had a really strong couple of leasing weeks. So I know the teams right now for the last several weeks have been strategically looking at where they can continue to dial back the concession use. Operator : And our next question will come from John Pawlowski with Green Street. John Pawlowski : First question is on CapEx, Bob. It's been running, I think, last year about 3,700 unit, up to 3,800 this year, which is 40% higher than 2022. Is this a new structurally higher level of CapEx we should expect moving forward? Or should we expect a reversion to historical levels in the coming years? Alexander Brackenridge : John, it's Alex. So there are a couple of factors at play there. One is -- and we talked a little bit about this last quarter, is leaning in more on some ROI projects, specifically renovations, some solar installations, some smart rent installations as well, and EV chargers. So there's some things that we can toggle up and down. They have ROIs on them, and they're discretionary. So that's in the mix. There's also an element of catch-up from the pandemic. Those are projects that we just couldn't get to because we didn't want to disrupt our residents who were staying at home at that time. And so there's a little bit of catch-up there. So we're going to have a couple of more years of that, we think. So I think this 3,800-ish number is pretty good. John Pawlowski : Okay. And then a question on markets. I mean, Michael or Mark, I guess, which markets when you're looking at just in terms of the absolute level of rents are you more concerned you're getting closer to hitting the affordability ceiling? Michael Manelis : Yes, John, this is Michael. So really, from the affordability standpoint, I wouldn't say we have any concerns at all. I mean we're not seeing a material shift. We still sit at about 20% rent-to-income ratios. And the range is fairly tight, running between like 18.5% to 24%. And the Southern California markets are sitting up at that higher range and they really historically have always been up at that level. So I'm not concerned about us hitting that point where the affordability index. I think what we saw in a market like New York where you had such robust rent growth through the peak leasing season last year, you hit that point where kind of you felt like you hit a rent fatigue level. We're not seeing any of that right now in the portfolio, but it's still pretty early into the leasing season. So I'm more looking at that absolute rent level than anything around the affordability of our resident base. Operator : And our next question will come from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Michael, I was wondering if you could just provide a little bit more commentary on the San Francisco and Seattle sort of strengths, and whether you can determine are those kind of folks that are returning to the market? Are they just kind of moving around the Bay Area and Seattle? Just how do we think about that demand that's picked up in the drop in concessions? Michael Manelis : Yes. It's a great question. So this is Michael. So I look at those markets right now and I think, clearly, we did see some marginal improvement with the migration patterns. We're still running with a slightly higher percent of new residents coming to us from within the MSA, meaning we're just trading around within the MSA. But we are marginally seeing some improvement, but we are elevated still from those historical norms. And I think we're going to remain elevated until you see the catalyst of either job growth or specific to like Downtown San Francisco really seeing kind of a more robust return-to-office policy. So in terms of the demand, it's not really like the migration factors that are doing it. I still think you see some folks coming from further out near or in, and that was a little bit of the catalyst that we saw. And you also get a different sense of vibrancy. I mean we talked about this now for over a year. Every quarter, the cities, those metro areas seem to start feeling better and better. And you're seeing that play out. So right now, our positioning -- we've got both markets sitting up at 96% occupied. It gives us a lot of confidence to keep pressuring whether we're raising the absolute rate, holding back the concession, we're seeing the sequential build in our net effective rent. And that's what we're looking for. As long as the velocity holds, we're going to do really well through the peak leasing season. But we've seen these markets before kind of have fits and starts. So I think it's just too early to call that these are wins for the year. Mark Parrell : Yes, I'm just going to elaborate. It's Mark, Steve, I'd add a little bit. Again, we do see that improvement in Downtown San Francisco, but it's not yet the job growth we probably need to drive rents. But we're 14% or so below rent levels that we're pre-pandemic. So there's definitely room here. Incomes have gone up, as we've talked about on the calls. The crime statistics in the city of San Francisco generally have really improved compared to last year and compared to pre-pandemic levels. And as Michael said, politically, we think the March 2024 primary was a real watershed moment. We think the citizens really took it upon themselves on both public safety and other matters to really take back their city. So we're excited about some of the progress there. The AI revolution is a big driver potentially for San Francisco, the city and the Bay Area more widely. Our numbers indicate that the Bay Area is getting 13x more funding than the next metro area in terms of AI investment. Now that's very significant. Now those jobs aren't that many yet. I mean they are a few hundred. They're not the thousands. So we're not seeing that job growth yet that we really need to drive our numbers. But we are seeing that network effect where companies like OpenAI was incubated at UC Berkeley and it opted to stay in San Francisco. Some of these incubator firms have moved back in to San Francisco from the city, from the suburbs. So that's all really positive. In Seattle, I just want to give a plug for our friends in the Northwest, I mean this enormous $700 million project, their version of the Big Dig, to take the Alaskan Way highway and put it underground and really activate the waterfront is really significant. It's driving tourism, it's driving activation slowly but surely in Downtown Seattle. Seattle's problem is really going to be the supply issues. There's just a fair bit of supply. But we do see activity levels improving. And again, politically, the city council and the mayor are much more focused in Seattle on public safety and quality of life because that's what their constituents have told them to be focused on. So again, we're pretty excited. And I guess we'd make the statement that we continue to see Seattle and San Francisco as when, not if, stories. And the when could be this year if things continue as they are, but we need to see a little few more months of continued good results in a market that, again, can give you a head fake once in a while. Steve Sakwa : Great. Maybe the second question, I don't know if Mark or Bob, you want to take this, on the -- I guess it was on the late fee California settlement and the charge that you guys took in the quarter. Can you just kind of elaborate or say what you can say about that? And does this kind of put this issue to bed? Or could there still be lingering kind of issues that come out of that lawsuit? Mark Parrell : Steve, it's Mark. Thanks for that question. I mean we are still in active litigation, as you suggested in your comment or your question. So there's not a lot I can say. Just to give you a little background, this has been a case that's been going on for 10 years. About the amount of late fees, we just got a ruling from a judge that was adverse to our interest, so we adjusted the reserve. We are considering our appeal options. So to your point about adjustments, they could go up or down depending on our actions. Also the judge didn't give us a number. He gave us a methodology, and we're working out with claimant's council what that means. So we can charge late fees, it's just the amount that's an issue. So we need to figure that out. So there could certainly be additional adjustments. I wouldn't expect them to be terribly significant upward. But if we win an appeal, I guess there could be a downward adjustment. But this is going to go on for a little while yet, I would think. Operator : And our next question will come from Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Joshua Dennerlein : I appreciate all the comments on San Francisco and Seattle, definitely a hot topic. Could you just remind us your split between urban and suburban exposure in those markets? Alexander Brackenridge : Yes. Josh, it's Alex. In Seattle, we're 60% urban and 40% suburban. In San Francisco, it's the opposite of that. So we have a broader suburban exposure there. Joshua Dennerlein : Okay. Cool. I appreciate that. And then I guess just are the trends like really materially different between the urban and suburban assets in those markets? And just trying to figure out like the dichotomy going forward. Michael Manelis : Yes. Josh, this is Michael. Yes, they're absolutely different. And again, this remains the story about kind of the City of Seattle and Downtown San Francisco is where we see kind of the least amount of pricing power, kind of lower occupancy. So the suburban portfolios are clearly outperforming the urban, and that's a trend we've seen for a while in those markets. The only thing I would call out in San Francisco is that you do have some supply coming back to the South Bay and it is back-half loaded. So you do need to see kind of that demand pick up because you have like 4,000 units coming back to that submarket just later on this year. But again, it's doing -- it's performing very well right now. We saw it absorb 4,000 units a couple of years ago. So it's nothing that we're concerned, but it's still something that we're watching for. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Derrick Metzler : This is Derrick Metzler on for Adam Kramer. I wonder if you could tell us anything about the cadence of same-store growth for the rest of the year and kind of what to expect given the strong 1Q and full year guidance that's kind of well below that? Robert Garechana : Yes. Thanks, Derrick. It's Bob. I'll take that. Let me start because there's a few pieces driving this, but let me start on the same-store revenue front with the residential rental component. Our assumption for residential rental income is that we anticipate a year that is pretty normal, meaning that sequentially, we expect the blended rates to continue to get better until they seasonally decline in Q4. And so you're going to see that normal kind of robust growth pattern as you work your way sequentially through. On the other income front, which also drives the same-store revenue piece, that's a little bit lumpier. So we expect to see bad debt improvement and increased income from initiatives later in the year as well. So that will all help growth as you kind of continue on sequentially as well. And then the nonresidential side, which you saw some lumpiness in the first quarter that we disclosed in a footnote on the bottom of Page 10, that is going to be a little bit of a drag when you get to the back half of the year. But when you get to the full holistic year, it doesn't really impact same-store revenue overall. So normal kind of seasonal trajectory. Given the comp period, when you put it in the blender, when you look at quarter-over-quarter, we would expect the quarter-over-quarter to be lower in the back quarters of the year than they are in the first quarter. Derrick Metzler : Got it. And anything on expenses, too? And the cadence there for the year? Robert Garechana : Yes. Also pretty typical. We certainly had a very good first quarter on the expense side, better than what we anticipated as we kind of highlighted in the disclosure. And we didn't adjust guidance at all. So we do expect that it's -- while it's early, we're being a little bit cautious on the expense side. So we're hopeful that we can do better than the midpoint of our guidance range, but we'll see. But from a growth trajectory standpoint, remember that Q2 and Q3 are always usually the higher growth rate periods because you have more turnover going on in the portfolio because you're in the leasing season. So you expect those growth rates to be higher. And then the only other thing I would highlight is 4Q had a difficult comp period. 2023 fourth quarter growth rates were really low, and so we have a little bit of a harder comp period in the fourth quarter. But we're off to a really good start on expenses, and so we're cautiously optimistic there. Derrick Metzler : Thank you. Congrats on the strong quarter. Operator : And we'll take a question from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Michael Goldsmith : At what point during the year do you feel confident about maybe not hitting the low end of the guidance, like recognizing you don't make adjustments for the first quarter of print, you did speak about trends being ahead of expectations, I guess maybe the question is, are you, at this point, do you feel like you're trending at the higher end of the range or above the range? Where you sit today? And what will give you confidence about adjusting that with the next quarter? Mark Parrell : Thanks for the question, Michael. It's Mark. We generally look at this at the end of each quarter. And because we have so much disproportionate activity in the second quarter, that it makes sense to us that that would be the time to really look hard at this. It's a really volatile world, even more so than usual, both in the economic terms and every other term you could think of. So to us, it makes some sense to wait. We've got a few markets that feel like they're poised to recover, but Seattle and San Francisco specifically. And those have been a little bit -- markets with a little bit of volatility as well. So I guess I don't know what to say about whether you get the low end of the guidance or the high end of the guidance, but right now we're clearly pointed to the high end of the rev number and the lower end of the expense range. But this is just 1 quarter and there's a lot of time to go. And again, we feel very optimistic and very excited about the fundamentals of the business, and we'll report back in July and tell you where we are. Michael Goldsmith : And my second question is, you sold a couple of properties during the quarter, used that to buy back some stock, paid out some debt, maybe fund some of these development. Would you look to kind of continue to sell at the current piece? And does the fact that -- you did talk about how there's $200 billion of dry powder on the sidelines to reinvest into real estate, like would you continue to sell even if there is nothing to acquire? Alexander Brackenridge : Michael, it's Alex. We're going to slow down the dispositions until we see better visibility into the acquisition side of the market. And it did feel like 2 or 3 weeks ago we were getting there, that there were -- buyers and sellers were kind of finding common ground at around 5 to 5.25. But then the inflation report came in hot, hotter than expected, and that really kind of threw everything backwards to where we were a quarter ago, where there's a pretty good spread right now, the tenure, I think, is over 4.6 today. And so we're just trying to figure out what the cap rate environment is for acquisitions. And so we'll just temper the dispose until we get a better sense of that. Operator : And our next question will come from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Haendel St. Juste: I had a follow-up on, I guess, the rent reversal -- I'm here. Can you hear me? Mark Parrell : Yes, we can now. Go ahead, Haendel, we can hear you. Haendel St. Juste: Sorry about that. So had a follow up on the rent reversals during -- okay. I had a question on the rent reversals in the quarter. The improved collectibility expectations you outlined, I assume they were tied to Rite Aid. So can you outline what's changed there and why you're adjusting your expectations? And then what's the net-net of all of this beyond this year? I think you said this year was a net neutral event. So just curious if the space now spoken for or what we should expect over the next year or 2. Robert Garechana : Yes. Let me -- Haendel, it's Bob. Let me clarify real quick. So relative to expectations, we had in our guidance expectations as we called out the straight-line receivable reversal as it relates to nonresidential. So there's no change to expectations. The other thing I would point out is that the benefit in the first quarter actually has no relation to the Rite Aid lease that we talked about last year. So let me describe what it is. You may recall that during the pandemic, we actually took a large write-off of the straight-line receivable related to a variety of tenants, which converted those nonresidential tenants to a cash basis of accounting. Under the accounting literature that, over time, when your outlook on collectibility changes, you convert them back to an accrual basis level of accounting. So you put that straight line receivable back on the books. As you can imagine, given the nature of the tenancy and the nature of that space in the retail, we're very cautious to ensure that there was our collectibility view change. So we had a pretty high hurdle rate in terms of determining that we thought that these leases would be collectible, and we did so in the first quarter, but that was intended and anticipated in guidance. So what you saw was a return of that receivable balance. We don't expect there to be much more there in the quarterly cadence for nonresidential. And so that's kind of what that nature was specifically. Since you mentioned Rite Aid, I will just say one quick thing on Rite Aid because that is a rather large space. So that space, the lease was terminated associated with Rite Aid, but we have re-leased it. So we have an active lease with a very high credit quality tenant. We're in the process of putting TI dollars into that. And once those TI dollars are completed, which should happen later this year, at that point, we'll turn the space over and we can begin revenue recognition on that lease specifically. And that's the update on Rite Aid. But otherwise, there's nothing -- there's no relationship with Rite Aid at this point. Haendel St. Juste: That was helpful. And then on -- a question on the second quarter guide here. Yes, a quick one on the second quarter guide. It seems a bit low versus what we and I guess the Street was expecting, especially in consideration with the rental dynamics you're enjoying. So curious if there's any one-timers impacting that. Anything in there from a dispositions perspective, anything moving the needle? Or is that a clean guide? Robert Garechana : Yes. Good question. So as you saw from our full year guidance, we didn't adjust our full year guidance, but we did give -- provide for the first time NFFO guidance for the second quarter, and continue to maintain what is probably a little bit of a cautious outlook still. But there are a couple of callouts that I would say that are inherent in the Q2 NFFO guidance, that range that we provided, that are a little bit different than what you would have normally seen sequentially between Q1 and Q2, which I think is what you're getting at, Haendel. The core business continues to do what we would expect it to do as Michael just outlined. So the core kind of residential NOI business is growing the way that it would normally grow, but we won't have that sequential benefit from the straight-line receivable that I just described. So that's a little bit of drag on the sequential component. Overhead is also not declining as quickly sequentially as what it has done in historical periods for a few puts and takes. And finally, there is a little bit of transaction noise because we are front-end loaded on the disposition side. Oftentimes, when we do dispositions, we put those proceeds into 1031 accounts, which are interest-bearing cash accounts, but they don't earn as much interest as the NOI loss. That's a temporary dilution that we incur. And so that's putting a bit of a drag on the sequential Q1 to Q2 numbers. Mark Parrell : Just to elaborate, it's Mark. We don't expect overheads to be higher or different than our guidance range. It's just the cadence of it is a little different where, for a variety of reasons, the first and second quarter are more similar than usual. And you should expect a real decline in quarters 3 and 4. So we'll update that all in July, but we don't have any expectation that overhead is net higher. It's just the drop between the quarters is occurring between quarters 3 and 2, not between quarters 1 and 2 as has often been the case. Operator : And we have a question from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. James Feldman : Great. I guess just a follow-up to the 2Q number or 2Q guidance. So can you -- since it sounds like there's a lot of moving pieces, can you talk about just the core numbers? I mean what are you expecting for rents, blends, occupancy, same-store revenue in 2Q, just to maybe level set? Robert Garechana : We typically don't provide that degree of guidance. But I would tell you in terms of the actual same-store kind of revenue piece, what I would tell you is that, sequentially, what you normally see between -- in same-store revenue is call it $0.02 to $0.03 -- or NOI, sorry, is call it $0.02 to $0.03 of sequential improvement in NOI between Q1 and Q2. And that's pretty much where we are on the residential side. But we're losing, call it, about $0.01 from the nonresidential piece. We're also losing about $0.01 from the overhead kind of sequential piece along with a handful of other things in the transaction activity that we mentioned. And that's why you're only seeing $0.01 improvement sequentially. Keep in mind that the leasing activity that you execute in the second quarter typically has a bigger effect on revenue in the third quarter because those leases are ratably reset during the second quarter. So hopefully, that helps from a color perspective. James Feldman : Okay. Yes, that's very helpful. And then maybe thinking about your debt maturities in '25. You've got $250 million expiring, you're sitting on pretty low leverage at 4x debt-to-EBITDAre. You've got 8.25 preferreds out there. It sounds like you're slowing down the disposition pipeline. I mean what are your thoughts on just other investments, other uses of capital here? What do you think on the balance sheet side -- you probably just let things ride through year-end without any kind of meaningful changes of -- or debt pay downs or pay downs of any sort? Robert Garechana : Yes. As you mentioned, Jamie, the balance sheet is in phenomenal shape. I mean from an absolute leverage standpoint, it's very low. But you're also highlighting something that I think is worth noting, which is we have very little interest rate exposure because we don't have a maturity or any refinancing needs until the middle of 2025. And even when you look further out, there is a modest kind of maturity piece. So I think when you look at use of proceeds, probably in the menu of choices, debt paydown is the last one, to be frank. And we'd be more interested on the capital allocation front, whether it's acquiring assets or otherwise, even buying back shares just from a standpoint of whatever presents a better value proposition because we don't have any maturity issues and we have very limited exposure to rates. Operator : And we'll take a question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Mark, you mentioned $200 billion of dry powder, a lot of that focused in multifamily. At the same time, we have the Blackstone-AIR transaction. How do you think that's impacted pricing or will impact pricing on sales of either assets or portfolios in the market? Could pricing be more aggressive despite the recent rise in interest rates? Mark Parrell : Yes. That's -- I'm going to pull a little bit. It's Mark, on the comment Alex just made. I think when people saw the AIRC print, there was enthusiasm. I think when people felt like that, combined with the thought that maybe rates were going to go down in the relative near term, and you had some certainty on sort of the financial markets and such, that that was a positive thing for stability and for kind of closing that bid-ask spread that's existed for a while that Alex talked about for several quarters. And I think when the treasury sold off, when you saw rates really, that inflation print was high, and you have a 460-plus tenure, all of a sudden that threw that all back into play again. So I would say right now, we continue to struggle to see a great deal of product offered. I think the obvious evident enthusiasm for apartments in the private space, and we hope soon in the public space more so, is powerful. But I think there's still a bit of -- a pretty big difference between seller and buyer expectations, that I think was the gap was closing a little and now I think the gap remains. And Alex, how would you expound? Alexander Brackenridge : Yes, John, this is Alex. One thing that hasn't changed, although the rate environment is confusing to many investors, is the amount of product that's delivering, particularly in the expansion markets that we're excited about. And a lot of that just isn't capitalized to be owned for the long term. I mean it was merchant built in many cases. And we're eager to pursue that. We just need to come up with pricing that makes sense in the current rate environment. And there's some other owners of more stable properties that also were seeing some debt challenges, and we just expect more opportunities where, as Bob has mentioned, really well poised to take advantage of them. We just need the right price given the rate environment. John Kim : On the rebalancing strategy, it sounds like you mentioned that pricing has slowed down those efforts a little bit. At the same time, you seem very encouraged by the political environment improving in San Francisco, Seattle and New York. Do those policy changes or anything new in data as far as net migration or any other items potentially reconsider your views on either the timing or the strategy of redeploying capital into the Sunbelt? Mark Parrell : Yes. That's really an outstanding question. I think the really good news here is that both sides, whether it's Governor DeSantis in Florida, whether it's Governor Newsom in California or in New York or Governor Healey up in Massachusetts, everyone's thinking about supply as a solution. Where in 2018 when all the tumult happened started on rent control with the California Ballot Initiative, it was all about price controls, which obviously are not going to improve supply. So I think it's really a positive that everyone is trying to address supply in different ways, with different levels of effectiveness. I think the industry has done a good job. I give a lot of credit to Barry Altshuler who is our lead regulatory guy on that and many other people in the industry who pushed that supply argument, and we're seeing the results of that, and you're right to recognize it. But I also would say that places like New York, California, continue to need to work on being an attractive place to live and for businesses to locate. They need to be able to more effectively compete against places like Texas that are more attractive than they used to be in terms of amenities to our residents, our demographic, as well as to business leaders who just want to expand their operations in places where it's less complex and less expensive to do business. So I do say we remain open. I think New York is something we'll continue to think on. Right now, our opinion is you need to have some regulatory reforms away from housing just to make public safety better in some of those places and both to sort of encourage employers to relocate or to stay located in those markets. But I definitely see this as progress for sure. Operator : And we have a question from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Unknown Analyst : This is [indiscernible] on for Nick. On your expansion markets, could you share the lease rates and concessionary activity for Atlanta, Austin and Dallas in 1Q and April? Michael Manelis : Dennis, this is Michael. So in my prepared remarks, I kind of gave you some clustering around the expansion markets concession use. Right now, for us, I would kind of cluster Denver, Atlanta and Dallas together with about 25% to 30% of our applications receiving right around anywhere between 4 to 6 weeks. Austin is a little bit of the outlier and it's running about 60% of our applications with almost 6 weeks of concessions. But again, we only have 3 assets in Austin, so I don't think it's kind of overly indicative of what may be happening in the broader market. I'll tell you, we've been watching the new lease-ups and the concessions that we see. And right now, they really seem to be in line with what you would expect. There's nothing like out of the norm that's running anywhere between 4 and 8 weeks across all of those markets. And that's kind of one of those positive signs for us. Relative to the first quarter, I'll tell you, we've ticked down a little bit of our concession use. Most all of these markets have occupancies above 95% right now. So as soon as we get to that threshold, we kind of pulled back a little bit of the concessions and see what does that velocity look like. And we've had a couple of strong leasing weeks. So I think the teams are dialing it back. But we do expect concessions will remain in place in those expansion markets throughout the year because the levels of supply is going to continue to increase, which means we're most likely going to see these concessions stay. As long as they stay within the realm of reasonableness in this 4- to 8-week range on the new lease-ups, I think we're okay. That's kind of how we've modeled it. Unknown Analyst : Follow-up question, maybe at a higher level for Mark. You talked about this in your prepared remarks, turnovers at historic lows is a real affordability benefit for the rental product versus homeownership. Just curious if you could share any high-level thoughts on how you see this dynamic evolving in the near to medium term? Could this in theory be a durable demand and profitability tailwinds over the next cycle? Mark Parrell : Yes. I think 2 of the biggest structural advantages to the rental housing business and the apartment business are what you just identified, the fact that home ownership is just tough. And that's for a lot of reasons. So many people are locked in with the real low rates on mortgages. It makes it very attractive to stay in place even if they might move or downsize. So that will slow things down in that market. I think the amount of production by the homebuilders is just a lot lower than it was pre-GFC. I think the cost of ownership, including things like insurance, are significantly higher. And I think all of that together makes rental housing a lot more attractive, and that's likely to be a persistent benefit. And embedded in that is just a lack of supply. So even though Michael just talked about some of the impacts of supply in these expansion markets for us and for people that own in the Sunbelt, that's certainly a pretty profound impact for the next couple of years. It still means that the U.S. as a whole is undersupplied in housing. And I think at 1.5 million units a year of owned and rental housing supplied, the same as the number was in 1960 for a population twice as big, you can see the opportunity there if you own like we do, 80,000 well-positioned nice units to rent in some of the higher growth parts of the country. So I think those are huge secular tailwinds to our business and are likely to persist. And that's why, again, we want to stick with our strategy of having balance, being in the 12 best markets, these expansion markets, for 20%, 25% of NOI, and the remainder in these established markets where our higher-end resident wants to be and take advantage of the supply imbalances, and frankly, the preference that we think is going to be pretty persistent for rental housing. Operator : And we'll take a question from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Linda Yu Tsai : Where are renewals going out in May? Michael Manelis : This is Michael. So I'll just give you a sense. So renewals right now are out in the marketplace for the next 90 days, for the next 3 months. Very consistent right now, the quotes are running between 6.5% and 7%. And that gives us a lot of confidence that we expect to achieve somewhere right around that 5% on the net effective side. Linda Yu Tsai : Thanks. And then just on bad debt, there's going to be a 30 basis, I guess, contribution. What's the cadence of like that is as you move through the year? Robert Garechana : Linda, it's Bob. We would expect to start seeing improvement in the second quarter because you saw Q4 to Q1 was relatively flat. But we're seeing some of the lead indicators, as Michael mentioned, in terms of the timing of the courts and other things, indicate that we should start to see some sequential improvement in Q2. And then we would expect it to continue on that process, although it can be volatile in Q3 and Q4 such that, by the end of the year, Q4 is maybe ends at, call it, 90 basis points of total revenue. That means for the full year, you're getting that 30 basis points of improvement. Linda Yu Tsai : Helpful. And then one last one. On the NYC housing laws, do you view that as more of a net benefit or a detractor for your apartments in that region? Mark Parrell : Yes. I'm going to answer your question very precisely because I take it to mean impact on Equity Residential, and I'd say the impact on Equity Residential is pretty modest, pretty insignificant. That's because about 40% of our units are either called luxury units under the law, meaning the rents are at higher levels, or that we own newer buildings, buildings built in 2009 or later. And for the other units, for us to get over an 8% or 10% renewal increase, which is what the law would limit, 2023 was a great year in New York, so just looking backwards, but it wasn't that great. And it would be more impactful to us in a year like late 2021 or 2022 when we were trying to recover from the pandemic and rents were going up more quickly on renewal and we were taking away concessions. That market is not that kind of market right now. So I would expect right now for it not to be terribly significant to us. And again, a great benefit, I think, in trying to encourage supply, which I noted in my remarks. I just think rent control in general does not encourage more supply into the market. So we got to work through that in New York. But I do think having some certainty here for everyone involved is a plus. Operator : And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference back over to Mark Parrell for closing comments. Mark Parrell : Thank you all for your time and your interest in Equity Residential. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you and that does conclude today's conference.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead. Marty McKenna : Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's Second Quarter 2024 Results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer; Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, is here with us as well for the Q&A. Our earnings release is posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Thank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. I will start us off, and then Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer, will discuss our second quarter 2024 revenue results and outlook as well as give some recent highlights from what we call our property operations innovation machine. And then Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer, will discuss our expense results and updated normalized funds from operations guidance, and then we'll take your questions. Looking at our quarterly results. Same-store revenues increased 2.9%, and same-store expenses rose only 2.7%, which led to same-store NOI growth of 3% and an increase in our NFFO per share of 3.2%. So far this year, our revenue performance has exceeded expectations as steady demand across all of our markets has met limited supply in our coastal established markets. As a reminder, approximately 94% of our NOI comes from our coastal established markets. Michael will get into the details shortly, but the Northeastern markets of Boston, New York and Washington, D.C. as well as Seattle are standouts relative to our expectations back in January. Our expansion markets of Atlanta, Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth and Denver, which together constitutes 6% of our NOI, continue to have good demand, but remain under pressure from continuing high levels of supply with our Atlanta and Austin portfolios most impacted. Putting all of this in a blender, this led us to increase our same-store revenue guidance by 70 basis points at the midpoint to 3.2%. Underlying these positive results and outlook are several trends that continue to support rental housing performance, including high homeownership costs, limited for-sale inventory and a steady though moderating employment picture. We continue to see high levels of retention among our residents due to elevated homeownership costs, with homeownership processing record levels last month, making rental housing a good value alternative. We also see a steady employment picture in our target higher-earning renter demographic leading to sustained good levels of demand. In the second quarter, we saw a continuation of total employment growth across nearly all of our markets. Drilling down the office using employment, we saw a return to positive growth in Q2 for the first time in several quarters, with strong numbers posted by Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and Atlanta. And, of course, lifestyle factors like delayed marriage and childbearing, which we've talked about on prior calls, continue to be a positive factor. The expense side of the equation is similarly positive news as we continue to utilize our sector-leading innovation machine to drive improvements in both our cost structure and our resident service experience. We lowered the same-store expense midpoint of our annual guidance by a full percentage point to 3%, leading to a new same-store NOI guidance midpoint of 3.25% for the year, which is 145 basis points better than our prior midpoint. My appreciation to all my outstanding on-site and corporate colleagues, their hard work and dedication to our customers and to supporting each other. Switching to capital allocation. We're seeing more transaction activity as the interest rate climate stabilizes and sellers and buyers cap rate expectations coalesce around 5%. Transaction volumes in our markets in the second quarter of 2024 was almost triple what it was in the first quarter and double what it was in the second quarter of 2023. As you saw in our release, during the second quarter, we acquired one property in suburban Boston. And subsequent to the end of the quarter, we acquired a property in Atlanta and one in Dallas. Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, is here to answer your specific questions in a moment. But generally speaking, we are buying recently built properties in our expansion markets at a basis that compares well to replacement cost and underwriting a 5% forward cap rate with our pro forma assuming further degradation of rents, but also assuming the benefits in year one of our more focused delinquency and vacancy management processes. In year two, as we get the acquired properties fully integrated into our superior operating platform, we are assuming that we can pod the acquired properties with our other nearby properties as we obtain scale in these markets and efficiently share employees across properties as we do in our coastal established markets. While we acknowledge that current rent levels are weak in these expansion markets and likely to remain so in the near-term. In the longer-term, we see relief on the way that starts in these oversupplied markets have collapsed and deliveries in 2026 and in 2027 are likely to be much lower than both current levels and historical levels. These expected lower supply levels underpin our property acquisition underwriting in outer years where we expect a significant rental rate recovery. We are excited to acquire these properties at a basis that we see as highly favorable and add properties with strong cash flow growth prospects once supply levels normalize in a few years. The entire Equity team also looks forward to demonstrating our core competencies of smartly acquiring and efficiently integrating new acquisitions. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael Manelis. Michael Manelis : Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This morning, I will review our second quarter 2024 operating performance as well as provide some highlights of our increased same-store operating guidance. As you saw in our release, our overall operating fundamentals remain healthy, driven by good demand across our portfolio and a strong renewal process that resulted in low resident turnover and strong occupancy of 96.4% for the quarter. As Mark mentioned, we are benefiting from what we see as a solid job picture across the country keeping our residents well employed with growing wages as well as very little competitive new supply in our established markets. The rent-to-income ratio on new move-ins during the quarter remained stable at around 20%. Not surprisingly, we are also benefiting from a very low percent of our residents moving out to buy homes. About 7.5% of our move-outs gave bought home as the reason. This is the lowest number we have seen in any given quarter. That, along with the benefits of our centralized renewal process, has made our year-to-date results on renewals, both in terms of the volume of residents renewing and the achieved renewal rate increases, a key driver to our outperformance. As has been the case for a while now, our East Coast markets are the best performers with occupancies around 97%. On the West Coast, Seattle is performing particularly well, and San Francisco is showing improvement but not quite at the pace of Seattle. Our Southern California markets have good demand, but are feeling some pressure on pricing. In our expansion markets, we continue to feel the impact of new supply as expected, but have been able to maintain occupancy at or above 95% given the strong demand in those markets. Overall, we continue to see improvements in the eviction process times as the court systems work through their backlogs and the number of long-standing delinquent residents continue to decline. This trend continues to support our view that we will see overall improvement in bad debt net contribute 30 basis points to our same-store revenue for the full-year. Given all of these trends, we have revised our full-year same-store revenue guidance midpoint to 3.2%, which includes an assumption of seasonal moderation in both new lease and renewals and a normal decline in occupancy later in the year. Now a little more color on the individual markets. Starting in Boston, the market is performing in line with our expectations, which assumed that it would be one of our best markets in 2024. Occupancy is holding strong amidst the highly seasonal summer leasing months as compared to past years when we often saw a declining occupancy as residents churned in and out more frequently. Overall, strong retention in the second quarter, along with continued new lease growth, has positioned us well as we finish the primary leasing season. We are seeing good performance in both our urban and suburban portfolios here, but the urban portfolio produced stronger results in the quarter. The market has a stable employment picture and little new competitive supply being delivered in 2024. New York continues to perform very well. We think this market probably has the best supply-demand dynamics in the country for the next couple of years. We're over 97% occupied, with both new leases and renewals coming in better than expected. Overall, the economy in New York feels healthy with a solid and increasingly diversified employment base. In fact, the private sector employment in New York is at an all-time high. All indications are that this market will continue to show strength through the remainder of the leasing season. Washington, D.C. continues to be a real standout performer for us in 2024. The market is over 97% occupied and showing great rental rate growth. Demand feels good across all of our submarkets, and we expect this to continue, but we will be keeping an eye on new supply deliveries in the back half of the year as we have felt isolated periods of pressure in the central D.C. submarket. In Los Angeles, a generally stable employment picture is leading to good demand in the market. Traffic and applications are up, and our second quarter occupancy, while slightly below where we wanted it to be, is up 70 basis points from the second quarter of 2023. During the quarter, our new lease change was negatively impacted by some concentrated new supply in Hollywood Mid-Wilshire as well as some shadow supply coming into the market in downtown and West LA submarkets from evictions. Our suburban deals in Ventura and Santa Clarita, which did not experience this, are leading the pack. We are already seeing marked improvement to the new lease change in the third quarter, but we expect this stat to continue to be volatile as the market works through filling these units, which remains a catalyst to our revenue growth. Rounding out the rest of Southern California, San Diego and Orange County are continuing to see good demand, but we are seeing some price sensitivity with residents willing to move further out in these markets for affordability reasons. Now for the markets that may be of most interest, San Francisco, Seattle and our expansion markets of Dallas-Fort Worth, Denver, Atlanta and Austin. San Francisco and Seattle continued to perform better than expected, with Seattle outperforming the most. Remember that we entered the year with relatively modest expectations and the potential for upside in both of these markets. In San Francisco, demand feels good right now, and we are seeing some of the best weeks in terms of traffic and application volume. We continue to see really positive signs in the downtown submarket in regards to the quality of life issues. Property crime is down, and the city's nightlife scene is thriving. Recent reports that Salesforce is pushing harder on return to office should have a positive impact on the city. Looking forward, there is little new supply coming to the market. Overall starts are way down, and there have been no new starts of competitive products for the last three quarters, which supports improving conditions for the next couple of years. As I mentioned earlier, Seattle is really showing signs of recovery. Occupancy is 96.2%. Our renewal performance remained strong. We're feeling good about both the quality of life issues in the market as well as tractions in places like South Lake Union from the return to office at companies like Amazon. The tech employment here looks solid as we see more postings for positions in both the city of Seattle and the Bellevue, Redmond area. And looking at our migration patterns, we are also seeing more people come to us from the farther out suburbs, which is an additional demand driver to our assets. Also, we expect our large concentration of properties in Central Seattle to benefit from a newly completed $800 million infrastructure project that better connects Downtown to the waterfront and created a spectacular new park for our residents to enjoy. We are excited to join in the effort to enhance Downtown Seattle with our newly completed $8 million improvement of the Staircase Plaza at our 761-unit Harbor Steps Apartments. Our steps and the associated new retail there are another way to connect the city down to the newly activated waterfront park. At this point, the Seattle market is positioned to do well, but there is supply coming later this year, and we need to see if the demand and pricing holds through the third quarter. Switching to the expansion markets. There's really no surprises here. We continue to see demand, but it's a challenging operating environment for both new leases and retention given the amount of new supply. Right now, the pressure on new leases makes renewing residents the number one priority in these markets. Overall, the expansion markets are performing in line with our expectations, with Dallas and Denver leading the way. Looking forward, we're excited to grow our portfolio and create operating scale in these markets that continue to demonstrate long-term demand from our target affluent renter demographic. And finally, on the innovation front. This past quarter, we began testing a new AI resident assistant that we anticipate could handle 75% of general resident inquiries, including the ability to help residents triage basic service requests and then automatically submit those that require a visit from our service members. In addition, we continue to see promising results with a self-guided tour experience app that increases tour availability to meet the needs of our prospects. We are very excited about these initiatives as they will continue to create future operating efficiencies, while providing a more seamless customer experience. I want to give a shout out to our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to innovation, enhancing customer service and their exceptional disciplined approach to expense management. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob. Robert Garechana : Thanks, Michael. Mark and Michael went over the drivers of our 70 basis point improvement in same-store revenue at the midpoint. So I'll focus on our revisions to same-store expense and NOI guidance, along with normalized FFO. Turning to same-store expenses. Expense management continues to be a core competency for the team. Our revision reflects this with a 100 basis point reduction at the midpoint, which is now below the low end of our prior range. This reduction reflects really solid year-to-date performance driven by three major categories : repairs and maintenance, payroll and utilities. These categories make up about half of our same-store expenses, and all three have growth that is either flat or negative year-to-date. While we expect growth to accelerate in the second half of this year given more challenging 2023 comparisons, we still anticipate delivering very low growth of around 3% for the full-year. This is yet again a reflection of the value in our platform from harnessing innovation, technology and efficiency to deliver outstanding results and attribute to our capable team. With these revenue expense and expense improvements, we are increasing our same-store NOI growth outlook and now expect same-store operating margin expansion for the full-year, something of a rarity in the apartment sector today. This NOI growth is the main driver of our $0.04 or 100 basis point improvement to NFFO growth reflected at the midpoint of our guidance. Page 2 of the release provides a detailed reconciliation of our revised NFFO guidance for your reference. One final note before I turn it over to the operator. This quarter, we enhanced our capital expenditure disclosure with the intent of providing stakeholders better insight into the value-enhancing CapEx activities we undertake. In 2024, these activities primarily consist of unit renovations, technology spend, and sustainability initiatives that are discretionary and provide positive return on investments through enhanced revenue growth, additional income or reduced expenses. These projects are often some of the best risk-adjusted returns we can make. With this new disclosure, we also believe that we are presenting our CapEx spend more in line with our industry peers. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi. Eric Wolfe : Hey, thanks. I was hoping you could go into greater detail on what you're expecting in terms of seasonality for the rest of the year. And I asked the question in part because it looks like you did of around 2.4% employment rate growth in the first half. You're guiding to 2.5% in the third quarter. So it feels like you're guiding to no deceleration in the fourth quarter, but just trying to understand if that's actually the case? Michael Manelis : Hey, Eric, this is Michael. And I guess I'll just start out. I'll give you a little bit of color. So first and foremost, I think specific to the third quarter, right now, we expect very stable kind of achieved renewal rate increases around 4.5% and slight seasonal moderation of new lease change. We do have a little bit of an easier comp in September from the declines that we saw last year. So it may hold up a little bit better than expected, but we didn't include kind of a lot of that in the initial forecast right now. Overall, for us, I think the key takeaway should be that we originally modeled kind of this full-year blended rates to be about 2%. And right now, we're expecting them to be closer to like the mid tubes. And a lot of that is going to depend on the mix of the renewals and new lease transactions, both in the third and fourth quarter. But if we just look at the snapshot today, I mean, the portfolio is over 96% occupied, our application volumes remain solid, and our net effective pricing trend curve is more in line with a normal year as compared to the slightly muted curve that we initially modeled. So I think right now, we feel like we're in a really good spot for July and all of our dashboards, all of these metrics just point to kind of normal seasonal deceleration curves both in the third quarter and fourth quarter. Eric Wolfe : All right. That's helpful. And then as far as LA, you mentioned some of the pricing weakness you're seeing from evictions. So I was wondering when you would expect that impact to sort of make its way through the market? And what type of improvement you would expect to see once that happens? Michael Manelis : Yes. I mean I think specific to LA, so first and foremost, right, we were focused on the occupancy build. We mentioned that on the last quarter call that we were doing some concessions. We were able to see a year-over-year lift in occupancy of about 70 basis points. And the new lease change in LA, it was less than what we anticipated by staying negative in the third quarter. And a lot of that was really based on the impact that we saw in new supply in some key submarkets of Hollywood Mid-Wilshire in Downtown. So I think when we think about the LA performance for us and like the recovery, clearly, we have upside built in for us. I still think for the balance of this year, we're going to continue to feel some of the pressure from the supply in those isolated submarkets. The start numbers are materially down, so that bodes well for future year performance. So in my mind, I think you should just expect as we continue to work through this year and get ourselves into next year for 2025, we're going to have some upside potential on the recovery. But we really like the total revenue story right now because we are filling these units with paying residents. So despite the new lease change stat that you kind of see being a little softer in the third quarter, the total revenue is still producing a pretty strong number for us. Eric Wolfe : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks, good morning. Michael, could you maybe just speak a little bit more about the renewals? I know it was 5% in the quarter. How did that trend kind of April, May, June? And then where are you sending out renewal notices today for kind of the July, August and maybe September time frame? Thanks. Michael Manelis : Yes. So first, I think the renewal performance through the quarter has been pretty stable for us right around that 5% mark. And I think as we look at the third quarter, like I said, we have a lot of confidence right now. We have quotes out in the marketplace for the next 90 days that range between like 6.5% and 7%. We're negotiating still a little bit more than norm, and we think this kind of slight bias towards occupancy, clearly, in some of like the expansion markets and even like the LA market that I just discussed, makes sense for us from a total revenue standpoint. So I think we expect, even as we work our way through the third quarter, pretty stable renewal performance results and we'll achieve somewhere right around that 4.5% mark. Steve Sakwa : Okay. Thanks. And then maybe on the capital deployment front, either for Alex or Mark, you sort of -- it sounds like everything is somewhere in and around five caps. I guess, how are you thinking about IRR hurdles today? And has that really changed as kind of the stock price has gone up and bond pricing, bond yields have certainly come down. So I guess, are you changing your underwriting criteria at all from an IRR perspective? Alexander Brackenridge : Hey, Steve, it's Alex. And you're right, we're pricing things that are generally say, newer -- or new product in say an $80 million to $120 million price range, typically in the suburbs and what we've been buying has been our expansion mark that around a five cap. And when we filter in relatively -- some slightly negative rent growth in the first year, offset by some operating platform improvements, flat year two and then a recovery in year three, which may be 5% for the next couple of years. As you're into -- half of '27 and half of '28, you're getting to a number that's around an eight. And that's a deal that works for us and fits within our cost of capital. Steve Sakwa : Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Adam Kramer : Great. Thanks. Maybe just focusing on the expansion markets. I want to kind of hear your view on maybe the potential progression of new lease growth, marketing growth this fall. If you can even kind of compare it to kind of typical seasonality, obviously, more supply there. So I just wanted to know kind of how do you think the Sun Belt will play out this fall relative to typical seasonal patterns? Michael Manelis : Yes, Adam, this is Michael. So I think I would just start by saying, as we think about the new lease change performance in the expansion market. So far, there's nothing that's really surprised us. I mean what you're seeing today is that we have a lot of former residents moving out that never received a concession. We're averaging anywhere between like 35% to 50% of applications receiving about six weeks. That's what's driving some of that new lease change. And I think as we think about the balance of the year and the seasonality, the interesting thing about these markets is that, one, they definitely demonstrate a little less demand seasonality, meaning that they don't drop off in demand quite as much as some of the shoulder -- in the shoulder seasons as some of the coastal markets do. So I think we have this opportunity that we could just kind of stay in the zone that we've been in. But we expect challenging operating conditions in those markets for the balance of the year. You can look at the new supply that's coming in. You look at kind of how we're balancing the trade-offs between occupancy and rate. And I think we just expect that we're going to be in this place for the next couple of quarters. I don't necessarily forecast that we're going to see marked deceleration from this point forward. But I think we would clearly expect to have difficult operating conditions for the balance of the year. Mark Parrell : And just to be fair, Adam, it's Mark. These are markets we don't have very large exposures. Meaning Denver now with 10 assets, that's a meaningful portfolio. But some of these markets, we're still building up our portfolio. So we're telling you what we see on the ground. It's certainly not maybe except as to Denver comprehensive. The portfolio will get larger. But I would say we ran in these markets until about 2015. We understand the impact of supply, and I think Michael's comments are generally applicable. But again, our knowledge on the ground is more for Denver and a little bit less for those other markets as we build the portfolio out. Michael Manelis : Yes. The other thing, I guess, I would just add besides the read through to a broader market is not our numbers is that a lot of the assets we own are brand new in the areas where a lot of the new supply is being built. So that's why we kind of say we expected those difficult operating conditions. But again, it's playing out kind of like we expected. Mark Parrell : Yes. And we bought those assets knowing that. And really depending on less CapEx in the long run, a better resident base. I mean we had a lot of reasons we thought these assets even though they would face that supply. We're better than maybe owning deep suburban assets that add outdated physical plants and outdated unit layouts and just would require a lot more CapEx over time. Adam Kramer : Great. That's really helpful. And I thought the blended rate for established market disclosure that you guys added this quarter relative to the kind of whole portfolio. I thought that was really helpful in just kind of showing the impacts of these markets. Maybe just -- and sort of to be fixated on supply here, but I think you guys had some interesting color on kind of the Seattle supply cycle maybe hitting a little bit later this year. Just wondering kind of among the established markets. Is this the market that you kind of have -- you're watching most closely in terms of supply? Are there others that maybe have a similar cadence in terms of deliveries maybe later than later peak than the national peak in terms of deliveries? Michael Manelis : Yes. Adam, this is Michael again. I really do believe that it is the Seattle market. Outside of the expansion markets that we just talked about, it's the Seattle market right now that we're going to have probably the most focused because it was back half loaded. There are a few more deals coming online in Redmond where we have a concentration of newer assets that will go head-to-head. And really, outside of that, when you look at this overall level of competitive supply pressure, which for us, we kind of defined by the proximity 1, 2-mile radiuses depending on the market. We have some isolated pockets like in the Korea town area and a little bit of Central D.C. that I mentioned in some of my prepared remarks, where we know we're going to continue to feel some limited pressure from the supply. But outside of those areas, we really feel like we're in a good spot from a less pressure from the supply coming online in the balance of the year. Adam Kramer : Great. Thank you so much for all the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Josh Dennerlein : Hey guys. Mark, just wanted to follow-up on a comment you had in your opening remarks on podding of the Dallas and Atlanta acquisitions. What kind of uplift do you expect from that podding effect versus that I think year 1 underwriting of, call it, 5%? And then does that podding effect assume additional properties in those clusters? Michael Manelis : Josh, this is Michael. So I'll just talk in general like about how we're approaching podding, which to us is really just sharing resources. Across assets today, we have about 65% of our properties that are already functioning with some level of shared resources. As we think about going into these expansion markets, clearly, we need the acquisitions to create those opportunities to create the density because the proximity of assets to each other really does facilitate the upside. And I think what you see is the benefits coming off of podding. Clearly, you see that show up in our payroll growth numbers, and that is what we would expect going forward in those expansion markets. But there's also opportunities in the service side of the business as we think about leveraging resources differently that take our dependency off of third-party contractors off. That kind of keeps that R&M number down as well. Mark Parrell : And just to elaborate -- it's Mark on that. It depends on where the asset is. In some cases, we're buying assets that are a ways out from what we have in contemplation or own already. So if it's an asset that's nearby, for example, in Central Atlanta, we own assets in Midtown already. And so owning more of their shared services are an obvious play. We bought assets in the Northeast quadrant of the suburbs. That asset is a little further out. There isn't as much shared service opportunity there. So it's a little bit asset by asset as well. Josh Dennerlein : Okay. I appreciate that. Maybe just stepping back, just how should we think about maybe the margin expansion opportunity across your portfolio in the years ahead? Mark Parrell : So I'm going to start, and then Bob may elaborate on this. So a little bit right now with inflation tailing off, I really thought about margin expansion more in terms of just blunting the rate of inflation in our expenses. Right now, I think what technology is allowing us to do is really harvest expense savings and not sacrifice on the service side. Michael Manelis has spoken to this, we're really shifting more to our revenue focus. So I think you're going to see us talk more about ways that we can provide additional services to our residents or be more efficient on that revenue line as opposed to just simply continuing to screw down expenses. There will always be opportunities there. But I think we're getting to a point on expenses where there's probably more opportunity on the revenue line for a bit. I don't know, Bob, if there's anything you'd add on the margin side there? Robert Garechana : No. And clearly, obviously, the revenue opportunity helps the margin even more so than the expense side, right? So being able to drive that kind of top line revenue opportunity, coupled with expense discipline that we've demonstrated and continue to demonstrate, we think that we can deliver a margin that is approaching 70% or hopefully even better as we kind of layer in these innovation and this technology and just -- the team operates at maximum efficiency. Mark Parrell : There's just a number of ideas that the group has that we're testing is the highest number we've ever seen. So just when you think about both expense and revenue opportunities, there's a lot of open experiments. And one of the great things about our platform is we can test it on three or four assets. If it works well for us and for our residents, we can roll out. And if it doesn't, well, that's fine, we'll go on to the next idea. So I think that's what's exciting about where we sit in our journey. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Anthony Paolone : Yes, thanks. Just to follow-up on the OpEx side there. So given all these initiatives, do you think we are back to a 2% to 3% expense growth range for the next couple of years? Mark Parrell : Hey Tony, it's Mark. I'll start. Bob will correct me as usual. I think it's going to be hard to say that with property taxes being 45% of our expense load. We've got a little and we footnoted 421-A burn-off pressure there. So I think that number is easily going to be three-plus and close to four at times in the next couple of years. And so it's going to be a little bit difficult for us to push that number below three consistently, I would think, without seeing some other big innovation occur. We'll continue to challenge Mr. Manelis to do that. But I think the property tax part is pretty uncontrollable. I do see some opportunity in insurance. I hope we get some benefit there, especially if the hurricane season isn't too bad. We don't own in those markets, but it's all very much connected. So I don't know, Bob, if there's something you'd add on the expense side. But to me, the challenge would be property taxes are tough to manage. Robert Garechana : And we do have some -- like Mark mentioned, this year, we had some step-up in 421-A. We will continue to have some more step up. But I think what we can kind of endeavor or what we do endeavor to promise is depending on the context is if inflation is X, we endeavor to perform the best we can at X minus, right? And so that's what those initiatives will do, and we continue to pressure Michael to deliver. Anthony Paolone : Okay. Thanks. And then just my second one, I know these are not big dollars for EQR. But I noticed that your advocacy costs are up a lot in the quarter versus, say, what you were spending in 2022 and even into 2023. So can you maybe just step back and give us a sense as to how you're thinking about the regulatory landscape and if anything has changed there? And perhaps whether some of the risk there has shifted to the federal level or if it's still just very much a local matter? Mark Parrell : Yes. Thanks, Tony. There's a few things in that, so I'll try and go through it. But first, directly, when you have a year like this with the California ballot initiative, you're going to see a lot more spending. So this is going to be much more akin to 2018, 2020 levels of spend on our side when we fought and successfully fought off valid proposals with the rest of the industry on rent control in California. So I would expect that number to be $10 million or more this year, and that's what's sort of contemplated in the numbers. There's a Reg G sort of reconciliation towards the back, but that's in there and that's something we would expect. And a lot of that spend will occur in the third quarter in contemplation of course, of the election in November in California. So a lot of the regulatory effort right now for the industry and for our company is focused on California. It is something we've beaten off two prior occasions by more than 20 points. So voters, I think are very sophisticated in hearing the arguments against rent control. I think it's really interesting in California that the forces of anti-housing, the people who don't want a single unit of housing built in places like Orange County love this measure, know that rent control means less production of housing. And I think people in California see that. So we're optimistic we can, again, help educate the voters in California and win on this measure again. In terms of federal versus state, I think there's just more activity that's more relevant at the state level. State and local is where most of our focus is. We did think that the President's statement about rent control is not productive. We talk to a lot of people in the administration, and a lot of those conversations are much more constructive than that sort of directly political proposal that came out that we think isn't going anywhere, but it's not helpful. So I do think most of the effort here is on the state and local side. We certainly are working with the two candidates for President, trying to educate staffs and talk to them about the opportunity to encourage supply at the federal level. And that that's something constructive the federal government can do. And so that conversation is ongoing with both the Harris campaigns and the Trump campaigns. But that's a focus on the federal side more is educational. On the states, it's both electoral and educational. Anthony Paolone : Okay. Thanks. That's really helpful. Appreciate it. Mark Parrell : Thanks, Tony. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Michael Goldsmith : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. With the increase in the occupancy guidance, does that reflect stronger demand or an intent to lean more heavily into occupancy in the back half of the year? And related to that, can you talk about which markets maybe where you're seeing occupancy build versus those where you may be pushing rate? Thanks. Michael Manelis : Yes. Hey Michael, so first and foremost, I think recognizing the gains that we've seen in occupancy year-to-date is a lot of the driver to the increase because we are modeling for kind of normal seasonality to occur, which would allow that occupancy to start drifting back down probably towards the later part of Q3 and into Q4. So I think for us, right now, East Coast stands out, right? I've got all three of our established markets on the East Coast running 97% plus. I don't know that I would say that overall, I have a theme that we're biased towards occupancy. I think we're looking market and submarket. We're really focused on how do we maximize revenue. And in several of our markets and submarkets, we saw really good demand, which meant we were going to put our foot down on the gas with rate and see what we could achieve and hold back some of that occupancy. And in other markets like the expansion markets and even L.A., we had demand, but we saw this opportunity, and we know what conditions are going to be like kind of for the next quarter or so, and we thought we would lean towards the occupancy. So I think every market and submarket has a different kind of strategic approach to it. But overall, right now, I would say that the raise is more indicative of what we've seen so far with the ability to achieve outsized occupancy gains and just expect normal seasonal drop-offs to occur for the balance of the year. Michael Goldsmith : Thanks, and as a direct follow-up, you talked about kind of like the expectations for a normal seasonal back half of the year. So if you take the blended spread expectations, it looks like it -- you took it from two to maybe the mid-2% range and assuming a typical seasonal year, like should we be thinking about the earn-in as we sit today for 2025 is 1.25%. And within that, like what are the factors that could change that over the coming months? Mark Parrell : Hey Michael, it's Mark. So we're not going to speculate about the earn-in yet. I think it's just too early to have that conversation. Michael Goldsmith : Got it. In that case, can I ask another question in that, right, like the NOI guidance grew by or moved higher by 145 basis points and the FFO guidance grew by 100 basis points. So can you just walk through some of the moving pieces in overhead and other that may have limited the flow through during the period? Robert Garechana : Yes, Michael, it's Bob. And I think there's a forward rec in the earnings release that can help you. But it is basically the main contribution to NOI growth offset in part by overhead growth that -- a good portion of that overhead growth is actually coming from property management and is related to legal costs associated with defense. Unfortunately, we do live in an environment where we are sometimes facing litigation -- regulation by litigation or attempts at regulation by litigation and our regular way kind of defense costs for various cases go through that property management line item, and we include those in normalized FFO. And so a good portion of the increase or the $0.02 production that you saw in that rec is associated with legal costs and the remaining is just kind of your regular way compensation accrual adjustments and the typical stuff you see in the second quarter. But that's basically getting you down to the -- reconciling you down to the $0.04 increase and the 100 basis points versus the 145 basis points difference. Michael Goldsmith : Thank you very much. Good luck in the back half. Robert Garechana : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thank you. I was curious if you could provide your thoughts on the spread between renewal and new lease pricing being several 100 bps? How sustainable do you feel like that is? And do we think that that may return to a more normalized spread later this year or more of a next year change? Michael Manelis : Hey David, this is Michael. So we've looked at the data going all the way back in time between these spreads, and it's not uncommon for the spreads to be 300 to 400 basis points different from each other, clearly, looking at the second quarter. I do think you're going to see a little bit of tightening in that spread going forward. I think with a little bit of that moderation of the renewals, just based on kind of where pricing is today in the marketplace, you'll see a little bit of that compression. But I don't think they're going to be sitting right on top of each other because it's fairly normal for us to maintain a spread between those two stats. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you. And I was curious if you could give the numbers for what the loss to lease was in 2Q? And where does that sit at this point in the summer? Michael Manelis : Yes. So I think first, let me just explain that. At the beginning of the year, our portfolio was in a moderate gain to lease position. We're about 60 basis points gain. And since then, we've seen that pricing trend sequentially tick up and follow kind of a more normal rent seasonality curve. And it's put us back into a loss-to-lease environment. As of the middle of July, our loss-to-lease in the portfolio was negative 3.6%. It's a little bit less than kind of what you would have saw in historical years, but a lot of that is just due to the expansion market pricing as well as kind of what we were seeing in the Los Angeles market. I do think it's important for everyone to remember that gain to lease, it's just a snapshot like point in time where you mark all leases in place to the market, and they don't directly translate into like a full-year revenue number growth. A lot of that has to do with the timing of who moves out. But again, I'm going to reiterate kind of what I said before, which is when I snapshot the portfolio sitting at the end of July today, we like the position we're at both from a pricing trend, from an occupancy, from an application volume. And even with the loss-to-lease at 36, we feel like we're in a really good spot for late July to deal with kind of the balance of the year. Unidentified Analyst : Amazing. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Nicholas Yulico : Thanks. Just going back to Los Angeles. I know you mentioned some supply impact, but I imagine there could be some demand impact as well from some of the disruption going on in Hollywood TV film industry. Can you just talk a little bit about any trends you are seeing in kind of exposure to that sector within the region? Michael Manelis : Yes, Nick, this is Michael. So I haven't seen anything right now in our numbers. For us, when we're looking at kind where the residents are coming to us from, the industries, I don't have an overly heavily concentrated kind of bucket that says I'm tied to like the studio activity. I think there's a lot of peripheral jobs that are all dependent upon that activity of the studios. But right now, the demand actually feels pretty good for us in L.A. What we're dealing with right now is that you have a lot of what I would say is the shadow supply occurring in the market, where units, not only in our own portfolio but in all the properties we compete against getting through the court system, getting through the eviction process. And that's really just bringing additional supply to the market. So you look at demand, you look at the fact that the occupancy is holding strong, 95.5%-plus. There's demand in the marketplace. It's just that you've got a lot more units coming into that market through this eviction process. And I think you just got to give it another couple of quarters for us to work through the absorption of those units. Nicholas Yulico : Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just -- one other question is on the transaction market. If you could talk a little bit more about maybe what you're seeing out there in terms of how buyers are underwriting assets in terms of rent growth for the next several years, how much that could be impacting like an initial sort of cap rate expectation? Alexander Brackenridge : Hey Nick, it's Alex. It really depends where you're underwriting that opportunity. In the expansion markets, as I said, most people are slightly negative and flat the first couple of years and then seeing a pop as supply goes away. In a more urban setting, say, in San Francisco, where there's still some recovery coming, it's a different underwrite, but probably starting at the same cap rate. There haven't been a whole lot of trades, but there are deals on the market right now, and my understanding is they're probably going to trade for a round of five. And that buyer is expecting better things coming. They're not seeing the supply issues, obviously, that we are in the expansion markets, but they're expecting that the city continues to improve and that rent growth is a little outsized for the next few years. So -- however you slice it, it does seem like the magic number is a five right now. And that number works well for us. We're going to be active both on the acquisitions and disposition side. Nicholas Yulico : Appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Thank you. It looks like new lease rent softened a bit in June relative to May. I know it's only 20 basis points. But I was wondering if you can comment on rents peaking earlier than what you've seen historically. And also as part of that, do you expect new lease pricing in the third quarter to potentially be flat or negative? Robert Garechana : Hey John, it's Bob. I'll start with kind of the monthly commentary, and then I'll pass it off to Michael to give trends. And to be honest with you, while your inference is not incorrect based on the information you have, one of the challenges of producing these monthly numbers, particularly when they are interim numbers, which is where you would have gotten those or that inference for June is that they were interim and the final was different. So if you actually peel back the onion and looked at the quarter monthly-by-monthly, June was our best number on new lease and on blend. April and May were slightly lower, which is very typical and very normal. But it is -- it gets confusing when you're producing these monthly numbers that are preliminary that change over time, which is one of the reasons why we don't think it's helpful to provide that degree of disclosure when you're not in meaningful inflection points. So -- and that's why we're moving away from those. But to reiterate and answer specifically, June was actually the best month in terms of spreads on new lease and blend, and I'll pass it over to Michael on the outlook. Michael Manelis : Yes, so in terms of rent peaking, I guess I would tell you going all the way back in time from like 2005, we kind of understand the rent seasonality component. And rents typically would peak somewhere in that July to the second week of August time frame. For the last two years, we've seen what we've described as almost like a double peak, where rents peaked in June then they softened down a little bit and then they come back up in that August period. Right now, we're in a little bit of that kind of mix where we've decelerated a little bit in the last couple of weeks. But we've got good volume. We've got strong applications. So my guess is we'll see kind of that pricing trend line pick up a little bit. Regardless whether we pick up and have a double peak or not, I'll tell you, our rents today are up 7% from where they were at the beginning of January. That's about 40 basis points stronger than a normal rent seasonality curve and definitely stronger than kind of the muted expectations that we started the year. So I think we like the rent level position that we're at right now. Whether we get a little bit more acceleration for the next couple of weeks really doesn't impact kind of our full-year outlook. John Kim : Okay. And then if I could ask about turnover, it went up a little bit, but still relatively low compared to where it's been historically at 11.7%. But can you discuss any differences between your established and expansion markets on turnover? Michael Manelis : John, this is Michael. So turnover clearly in the expansion markets is higher right now than the established markets. The renewal process, the residents have a lot of choices in the market. We're working really hard to do it, but the percent of residents renewing is more like in the mid- to high-40s, not the 55% to 60% that we see across the established markets. And I guess I would look at that overall turnover number and even in those established markets, I tell you, it's still pretty low. Right? And you could see that kind of versus all of our historical trends right now that we are at kind of historical lows for turnover across all of these markets. And that's just -- it's a good position for us to be in right now. John Kim : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. James Feldman : Great, thank you. I guess sticking with the turnover topic, I mean, are there any markets where you're actually seeing an inflection point of turnover rising? And similarly, any markets where you can flag price sensitivity more than others or an inflection point in price sensitivity more than others. Kind of tying into some of the comments INVH made on their call that there are some markets where they're seeing a change. Michael Manelis : Yes. I mean, I think I said in my prepared remarks, we saw in Southern California, clearly in the Orange County and San Diego just a little bit of a willingness to move further out for a lower price point. You could see that in the reasons for move-out kind of showing up in those markets. The overall numbers, though, when you look at the move-out reasons, our increase is too expensive, which is one of those areas that residents could denote when they're moving out. Actually, it was about 16% of our move-outs. And that actually ticked up a little bit from the first quarter, but remained well below what our historical norms were for that stat, which was more like 20%. And that really just continues to support this notion that our residents remain in really good financial shape and aren't really kind of feeling that immediate pressure. But as I said in the prepared remarks, I did -- this last quarter, we saw a little bit of that in Southern California kind of play out and it's something we're just going to continue to watch. But the overall rent to income ratios in the portfolio for new residents coming in is right at 20%, which continues to support this notion that they're in good financial shape. James Feldman : Okay. Thanks for that. And I appreciate your comments on the political environment. But I guess just sticking with D.C. specifically, and it sounds like either way, we're going to have a change in administration. Just historically, how does that market tend to trend around a Presidential election around a change in administration just in terms of demand? And what should we expect to see on the occupancy side? Michael Manelis : Ins and outs and very stable, actually. We've looked at this, trying to see if the actual administration completely change out what happens. Right now, we can't see anything in the data to suggest that there's a material impact to our overall demand drivers there. James Feldman : So you think it's pretty smooth, just through '25? Barring just normal... Michael Manelis : Yes, I think it's just stable. Mark Parrell : I think the federal government is a bit of a monolith. Keeps going. James Feldman : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Haendel St. Juste: Hey, good morning out there. Thanks for taking my questions. Mike, I was hoping you can provide a little bit more color on the West Coast portfolio. What you're seeing concession-wise across L.A., San Fran and Seattle. And what's your expectations are for blended rate growth for those markets in the second half versus the mid-2% portfolio? Thanks. Michael Manelis : Yes. So first, concessions for us in the portfolio do remain concentrated in the West Coast, and it's really Downtown San Francisco, the City of Seattle and Los Angeles. And for us right now, the volume of concessions in those markets it's really ranging about 15% in Los Angeles, just receiving under a month and in Seattle and San Francisco were more like 30% to 40% right around a month in those Downtown areas. So I think for us, we expect that the concessions are going to be stable here for the next couple of months. And then we do anticipate a little bit of an acceleration in the back half of the third quarter and in through the fourth quarter. And that's just kind of looking at what we've seen from a demand seasonality standpoint, where our expectations are. Our overall concession use did come in a little better than we expected. It was 25% lower sequentially from the first quarter and about 7.5% lower than the second quarter of '23. In terms of like the stats as to how to think about the third quarter there, we do have a little bit of an easier comp coming at us in Seattle and San Francisco. So my guess is the new lease stack could hold up a little bit better. Not a lot of impact on the renewals. We expect the stability there. And I think in Los Angeles, I don't anticipate a material change because like I said, the pockets that were feeling supply pressure, we don't anticipate that abating. And I think we're going to continue to work through some of the excess inventory from the eviction process, and that's going to take us through the year. So I just don't have a specific number I would give you for the quarter. I just think we've got different scenarios playing out across those markets. Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. That's very helpful. And Mark, maybe one for you. I guess I'm curious if any of the assets you bought here. In early third quarter, Atlanta and Dallas were from Lennar as they monetized their Quarterra [ph] portfolio. And I'm curious on your view overall of the portfolio trade that they had with KKR. It seems like a lot of that portfolio could fit your wheelhouse, newer assets, some coastal, some Sun Belt exposure. So I'm curious if you took a run at it? And any interest in the remaining assets that they may not have sold yet? Thanks. Alexander Brackenridge : Hi, Haendel, it's Alex. Yes, we did take a look at that portfolio. And no, we didn't end up with any of those assets. We were interested in a subset of the assets that KKR ended up taking down. So they included things that KKR wanted that we didn't want, frankly. So unfortunately, of, say, the 38 assets, there were about nine that were a good fit for us, and that wasn't a big enough chunk for us to prevail relative to KKR as a much bigger offer. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. Okay. So the ones here in early third quarter had nothing to do with Lennar. Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good morning out there. Thanks. And Mark, hopefully, that apartment education extends to Albany here in New York, definitely could use it. So two questions here. The first is, in the second quarter, you guys took a sizable, I guess, it's called commercial dispute and construction defects charge. So maybe if you could just walk a little bit more through that and maybe just a little background and if there are any other projects that could fitness or this is just something that had been growing for a while and finally came to fruition? Robert Garechana : Hey, Alex, it's Bob. So we did take a charge that you can see on Page 27, it's about $9 million. A portion of it was from a commercial dispute, which was basically a dispute related to a brown lease. So a very unique bespoke situation that is not recurring in any regard. So that was a portion of it. And unrelated to that, on a separate asset, there was a construction defect that was identified at a property, and we took a reserve around that construction defect. We are pursuing the parties involved in the construction of the assets. So there is an opportunity in the future to potentially recover some of that. This isn't that uncommon to have these kind of small construction defect issues where you have a situation and then a few quarters later, sometimes years later, you recover that amount from the insurance company of the contractor or a builder or from them themselves. So -- but it's nothing systemic or nothing that is recurring in nature. There's just two unique situations. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second question is, as you guys look at the landscape and everyone sort of has the same playbook, right? Supply is plummeting. Late '25 to early '28 is going to be these great years for multifamily. Given your degree of existing assets, are you guys thinking more about buying more existing assets to benefit as presumably rents really improve during this time period? Or your view is you'd rather invest more in joint developments, whether it's presales or JV developments, what have you, in getting more into development activity to have product that may come up and deliver sometime during this period? Just trying to figure out what you guys view as more advantageous, to buy existing assets or to invest in development, given what looks to be a healthy two to three years that are coming after the supply wave currently delivers. Mark Parrell : Alex, it's Mark. Thanks for that question. We're open to buying existing streams of income or open to developing assets. We'll do either, and we're doing both. But right now, our lean is towards the existing assets. We think there's still going to be quite a bit sold. You saw the comment I made about transaction volumes going up, a lot of nonnatural owners, just people that are developers that are in assets with shorter-term bank debt that we think are going to sell. And may not quite be at the fire sale price as people expected a couple of years ago, but there's still going to be good values compared to replacement cost, and we like that basis. There may be a play on development later. You may see more opportunities there. You've got construction cost issues. You've got execution issues all across the industry still. And you've got funding issues. I think development in a REIT is just very challenging at scale because you either have to prefund yourself and carry that cash to the detriment of shareholders or you have to go naked and hope that at the time you need the money, the capital markets are hospitable and you're able to raise it in an accretive fashion. So we like development. We like it up to a limit. And that limit usually is about what our free cash flow is, which is about $250 million a year. Because then we can sort of self-fund it and not worry too much about the external capital markets. So right now, again, the lean is towards the existing assets. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Mark Parrell for any additional and closing remarks. Mark Parrell : Well, thank you all for your time and interest on the call today. We appreciate it. Good day. Operator : This does conclude today's -- everyone else has left the call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Equity Residential Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Marty McKenna. Please go ahead, sir. Marty McKenna : Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's third quarter 2024 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer; and Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer. Bob Garechana, our CFO, is here with us as well for the Q&A. Our earnings release and management presentation are posted in the Investors section of equityapartments.com. Please be advised that certain matters discussed during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. The company assumes no obligation to update or supplement these statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. Now I will turn the call over to Mark Parrell. Mark Parrell : Thank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2024 results and outlook for the year. I will start us off, then Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, will discuss our recent acquisition of Blackstone and the overall transaction market. And then Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer, will speak to our operating performance, then we'll go ahead and take your questions. We posted solid performance in the third quarter, driven by continued good demand and little competitive new supply in our established markets, which constitute 90% of our portfolio. Big picture, we continue to see a stable environment and a healthy consumer. Unemployment is low and wage growth is steady, both of which bodes well for our customers. In a moment, Michael will speak to the various puts and takes we saw in our operations during the quarter. As is usually the case, we saw some items like occupancy and retention exceed our expectations, while others like blended rate came in lower in terms of our expectations. As you can see on Page 5 of the management presentation that we posted to our website last night, this type of variability in pricing is not uncommon. In fact, pricing so far in the fourth quarter has normalized consistent with seasonal patterns and with our expectations. In sum, we remain on track with our same-store revenue guidance, and we expect to end the year in a good position for 2025. On the expense side, the machine continues to churn out to terrific results with same-store expense growth of 3.2% for the quarter and our expectation for full year same-store expense growth of 3%. I want to thank the team across our organization for their continuing focus on innovation, cost control and our customer. Turning to 2025, while there remains a considerable amount of economic and geopolitical uncertainty, that could impact our business and the economy generally, we like our setup. We are too early to give 2025 guidance at this point, but we have given you some insight into our preliminary thinking on some of the inputs for 2025 same-store revenue on Pages 7 through 9 of the management presentation. In sum, we think 2025 should produce solid same-store revenue results for Equity Residential. We see steady demand from a well-employed affluent renter base, a favorable supply picker and the 90% of our NOI in the less supplied established markets and continuing cost and lifestyle preferences favoring rental housing. In terms of our expansion markets, we expect that a recovery in same-store revenue will not occur until 2026, given continuing high supply levels, but we do hope to see some improvement in currently highly negative new lease rates and to see lower concessions during next year's leasing season. Now switching over to capital allocation. We accelerated our acquisitions of newer, well-located assets in our expansion markets of Atlanta, Dallas and Denver in the third quarter. We are excited to acquire these properties at a basis that we see as highly favorable and add properties with strong cash flow growth prospects as supply levels declined substantially over the next few years. The entire equity team also looks forward to demonstrating our core competencies of smartly acquiring and efficiently integrating new acquisitions. We now have approximately 10% of our net operating income in our expansion markets assuming stabilization of our assets under development. In a moment, Alex will give you more detail on our transaction activity. We are funding our expected $1.6 billion in acquisitions this year, with a mix of fixed rate debt, dispositions and the use of commercial paper supported by our unsecured line of credit. In a moment, Alex will give you detail on the disposition activity funding these acquisitions. The one source I did want to highlight is the $600 million in fixed rate debt we raised in September. These 10-year notes were issued at a coupon of 4.65%, which is the lowest 10-year coupon issued in the REIT space since 2022, and would be hard to replicate today. So, a nice job by Bob and his team on this. Before I close, a quick note on where these acquisitions fit into our overall capital allocation strategy. Our goal remains to own an apartment portfolio that has the highest long-term total return in the sector with a focus on cash flow growth and taking into account risk and with the least amount of volatility possible. We intend to achieve this goal by catering to well-earning renters in the 12 or so metro areas that we think have the most desirable lifestyles for this demographic and present the best balance of long-term supply, demand, regulatory and resiliency opportunities and risks and where we can efficiently operate our properties with our industry-leading people and systems. As the last few years have shown, there is no riskless apartment market. The volatility and negative rental growth we see in the expansion markets and the strong results we are seeing in our Northeastern markets, many of which were recently left for dead by investors, reinforces our commitment to our strategy of better balancing our portfolio between coastal markets and select sunbelt markets as well as urban and suburban locations. We expect the benefits of this balanced strategy to play out in 2025. Seattle and San Francisco, particularly our uniquely urban portfolios in those markets should generate better same-store revenue results, which, along with the continued strength in the Northeast, and the favorable 2025 supply picture across almost all of our established markets should more than offset continued supply-driven weakness in our expansion markets. In later years, the supply wanes in our expansion markets, those markets will be more of a same-store revenue growth engine for our company. We are confident this balanced geographical strategy, coupled with our efficient operating platform will create value over the long term for our investors, and are eager to demonstrate this over the next several years. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Alex Brackenridge. Alex Brackenridge : Thank you, Mark. As we discussed on our call in January, we came to 2024 committed to continuing to reposition our portfolio by increasing our presence in our expansion markets of Atlanta, Dallas and Denver. For the first half of the year, the market remained frozen and we made no progress. However, in the third quarter, as interest rates dropped and the possibility of a soft landing for the economy became more evident, market opened up and we significantly stepped up our activity, closing on 14 assets with over 4,400 units and a total price of $1.26 billion. Those acquisitions were funded by a combination of the proceeds from the $600 million bond issuance that Mark mentioned, $365 million in dispositions and $295 million of commercial paper. The dispositions consisted of six assets located in San Francisco, Washington D.C. and Boston that averaged 43 years old and sold for a 5.7% disposition yield. All of the assets were noncore holdings that had a combination of significant CapEx needs in a variety of operating challenges. The acquisitions meanwhile averaged just seven years old, have limited retail and are all 100% market rate. 11 came from an off-market portfolio from Blackstone that was tailored to fit our expansion strategy in terms of asset quality and locations. Recognizing our ability to provide speed and certainty of execution, Blackstone chose to deal directly with us rather than execute the typical auction process. The other three acquisitions were one-offs purchased for merchant building. After end of the quarter, we closed on an additional asset in Atlanta for $89.5 million. The weighted average cap rate on all this activity was 5% and is anticipated to generate an 8% unleveraged IRR. These transactions appeal to us because they allowed us to expand our presence in markets with strong job growth, increasing numbers of affluent renters and relatively low regulatory risk at an attractive basis that is approximately 15% below estimated replacement cost. Admittedly, these markets are also seeing outsized supply relative to our coastal markets. Accordingly, our underwriting reflects competitive leasing environments for the first two years of our ownership with rental income down or flat depending on the amount of approximate deliveries. We expect that some of that back to NOI will be offset by running these assets more efficiently on the revenue and expense side as we integrate them into our superior operating platform. We anticipate having further opportunities to purchase assets in these markets as the supply pipeline is up in 2026 and more robust rent growth will be on the horizon. But at that time, pricing will likely be at lower cap rates and at a less attractive price relative to replacement costs. As we head into the end of the year and plan for 2025, we expect to continue to see attractive acquisition opportunities at around five cap rates in Atlanta, Dallas and Denver. And with a cost of capital advantage and the ability to complete due diligence quickly relative to leverage buyers expect to close on a sizable share of transaction activity. We currently have an asset in Denver and one in Atlanta, totaling approximately $190 million under contract to close before the end of the year at around a five cap. Austin, our fourth expansion market, where we have only three assets remains challenged with a historic amount of deliveries that is resulting in a highly competitive rental market leading us to stay on the sidelines given hard it is to assess when things will stabilize. With our recent closings and assuming stabilization of development deals in progress, as Mark noted in his comments, we now have approximately 10% of our portfolio in our expansion markets, towards a goal of 20% to 25% that if the transaction market remains favorable, we expect to achieve over the next 18 to 24 months. We are excited to add exposure to these high job growth markets that will see declining supply over the next two to three years. What should not be forgotten, however, is that the reduction in supply is even more dramatic in our coastal markets, where starts are down nearly 60% in 2024 after being down over 30% in 2023. With 2025 starts projected to be down again, we anticipate one of the best supply-demand balances in our coastal markets that we have seen in a very long time. Our expansion market exposure, combined with our coastal market presence, positions us to generate optimal risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders, catering to a customer with a resilient and growing income while balancing out supply, regulatory and resiliency challenges. I will now turn the call over to Michael Manelis. Michael Manelis : Thanks, Alex. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. This morning, I will review our third quarter 2024 operating performance, as well as our expectations for the remainder of the year and what the setup for 2025 could look like. As Mark mentioned, fundamentals in our business remain solid. During the third quarter, our focus on serving our customers and our corresponding strong renewal process led to the lowest reported third quarter resident turnover in our history, and strong physical occupancy of 96.1%. Move-outs to buy homes remained extraordinarily low and renewal rate achieved was strong across most markets. Blended rate, however, ended up at the low end of our expectations for the quarter, primarily from lower-than-expected new lease change driven by the City of Los Angeles and continued pressure in our expansion markets. In these markets, the pressure from excess inventory from both eviction-related, existing and new supply, has led us to prioritize occupancy to maximize revenue, which came at the expense of some rate growth during the quarter. It is also important to remember that it is often not uncommon to see variability in new lease change over relatively short periods of time. For example, while we saw a steeper and earlier decline than usual and new lease change in the third quarter, we have seen a better picture so far in the fourth quarter for this volatile statistic. Looking at the remainder of the year, our strategy of maximizing revenue by maintaining higher occupancy heading into the quieter months of the year should drive performance along with positive contributions from other income and bad debt net. We still anticipate normal seasonal rent deceleration which will result in negative new lease change in the fourth quarter. But at this point, we are seeing very stable renewal rate achieved results. And of note, Seattle and San Francisco have both a relatively easier pricing comp in the fourth quarter and have shown good early signs of improvement, including maintaining strong occupancy and reducing concession usage. Sitting here today, our net effective rents at the portfolio level are close to 2% above prior year, which is also a solid position to be in. Now let me give you some color on the market starting with East Coast. The Boston market is one of our best performers in 2024. Both our urban and suburban portfolios are performing well, but consistent with our expectations, the urban portfolio produced stronger results in the third quarter. We like our positioning here as our urban-centric portfolio will see very little competitive new supply for the remainder of 2024 and the full year of 2025. Moving on to New York, demand feels good as we are more than 97% occupied. And as we have said on past calls, with a solid job market and very little competitive new supply, we think this market will continue to produce good revenue growth, and we'll have some of the best supply-demand dynamics in the country for the next couple of years. Rounding out the East Coast, Washington, D.C. continues to be the rock star of 2024. The market is over 96.5% occupied and is producing some of the top rental rate growth in our portfolio. Demand feels good across all of our submarkets and is expected to continue but we do expect some pressure from deliveries in the fourth quarter, particularly in the central D.C. submarket. On the West Coast, as I mentioned, Los Angeles showed some weakness in blended rate growth, particularly in the new lease change. We think there are a few factors in play here. First, our overall pricing power here was clearly impacted by less job growth than anticipated, especially office using jobs and a bit of a pause from the L.A. studios in the content production. Second, on supply, we are seeing some competitive new supply, particularly in the downtown, Koreatown and West L.A. submarkets, as well as some excess supply coming online due to continued improvements in the eviction process, which is now taking about four months, down from six months earlier in the year. Finally, the city is still working through some quality of life issues in the urban submarkets like Koreatown and Downtown L.A. Our suburban portfolios, primarily driven by Santa Clarita and Ventura County, are performing better than our urban submarkets. The good news is that we are seeing some positive momentum across the entire Los Angeles market right now. And with our rents on top of last year, a condition we have not seen all year long, puts us in a favorable position. In addition, today\u2019s occupancy is running 40 basis points above both the prior year and is trending positively versus the third quarter. We are also experiencing some of the highest retention rates of the year in Los Angeles. And while job growth has been somewhat muted in 2024, projections for Moody Analytics are much more positive for growth in Los Angeles in 2025, particularly office-using jobs. Assuming that comes to pass, then along with the modest new apartment deliveries in most places across this vast geography, we think we should drive a reacceleration of results in 2025. In the rest of Southern California, San Diego and Orange County, we continue to see demand but evidence of some price sensitivity with residents willing to move further out in these markets for affordability reasons. After showing some of the best growth in the portfolio over the last few years, we are likely returning to more normal long-term growth rates. Rounding out the West Coast, San Francisco and Seattle continue to perform better than our original modest expectations. At this point, we feel good about the pace of recovery in these two markets and they are set up to contribute to growth in 2025, and we have included a page in the management presentation that highlights some of the favorable trends we are already seeing in these markets. In San Francisco, demand feels good with occupancy of 96.2%, which is 90 basis points higher than last year. Rents are following normal seasonal patterns, but we are seeing slower deceleration compared to last year and renewals are performing well. In addition, some impactful return to office policy from firms like Salesforce, are helping to drive significant improvements to street activation. Having just spent a week in the market, you can really feel the energy and a reminder of why this market is the center of the tech universe, including the rapidly growing AI sector. On the supply side, there is very little new supply coming to the market. Overall starts are way down, and there have been almost no new competitive starts for the last year, which supports improving conditions for the next couple of years. We are optimistic about this market and its ability to drive our results in 2025. In Seattle, the recovery feels similar to San Francisco but further along. During the third quarter, same-store revenue reflected improvement driven by low turnover, strong occupancy and better-than-expected renewal rate achieved. New lease change, while still more negative than we would like is better than last year, and we would expect this metric to improve over time. As we sit here today, demand drivers are better than we thought. Our occupancy is over 96% and our renewal performance remains strong. And looking at our migration patterns, we are also seeing more people come to us from further out suburbs, which is an additional demand driver for our assets. The big recent story here is the five-day week return-to-office announcement from Amazon, which is the 800-pound gorilla in the market. For the past several weeks, our local team have reported increased interest from Amazon folks who are living further away from the office and looking for apartment homes in the downtown and South Lake Union submarkets. With focus from city government and the local business community, along with increased business and tourist foot traffic, livability in the downtown just keeps getting better. Another reason positive is that the tech employment in the market looks solid as we see more postings for physicians in both the city of Seattle and Bellevue, Redmond's area. As previously discussed, there is supply coming in the fourth quarter, and we will need to see how the demand and pricing holds. But at present, it should finish the year strong and like San Francisco, we have some real optimism on this market and what it can contribute in 2025. Switching to the expansion markets. The volume of competitive new supply continues to impact both occupancy and rate. Denver is our best performer of the expansion markets and our relatively small same-store portfolios in the other expansion markets, Dallas is producing the best revenue results in Atlanta where we have the most direct exposure to new supply right now is the worst. We continue to see demand, but it is a challenging operating environment for both new lease and retention given the amount of new supply. Similar to last quarter, the pressure on new leases makes renewing residents and maintaining occupancy, the number one priority for these markets. As you know, we added a number of new suburban assets to our portfolio in Atlanta, Dallas and Denver during the quarter that will have a while before they are in our same-store reported results. Overall, we are excited to grow our portfolio and create operating scale in these markets. While these markets have near-term supply risk, they continue to demonstrate long-term demand from our target renter demographic and provide a nice balance to our core portfolio. On the innovation front, we are very pleased with the initial results of our new AI resident inquiry application, which was able to handle almost 60% of our inquiries in our test market. We have a lot of confidence that as this application keeps learning we will get to 75% to 80% coverage, which will create an additional layer of operating efficiencies in the company. Looking ahead, now that we have centralized the support of many parts of our customer journey, we are looking forward to improving and optimizing those processes, including the upcoming efforts to streamline the leasing process to make it faster and easier for our renters. Before I discuss the 2025 building blocks, I would like to highlight our expense performance in the quarter. Continued favorable results on property taxes, low increases on repairs and maintenance and utilities and an actual decrease in on-site payroll drove the quarterly results and should get us to our expected 3% midpoint for the year. We are very proud of our 10-year same-store expense compounded annual growth rate of 3.2% and consider cost control and innovation implementation as core to our DNA at EQR. In closing, as Mark mentioned, while it's still too early to give 2025 guidance on Page 7 in the management presentation that we have published last night, we gave some building blocks for next year's revenue performance. Overall, the setup for 2025 feels solid. Today, we expect that we will start the year with embedded growth near 1% and in a very well-occupied position. We also have a very favorable setup as the expected deliveries of competitive new supply in our established markets will be lower again. And while the expansion markets still have significant supply expected, the absolute quantity is beginning to come down. On top of all of that, we like our ability to attract and retain new residents. In particular, we are most excited about the potential we see from our focus on the customer and our ability to maintain occupancy along with the upside we see from our West Coast markets of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle, which make up 42% of the company's NOI. Those factors, coupled with the continued performance in our East Coast markets should deliver solid revenue results for the company in 2025. I want to thank our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to innovation, enhancing customer service and their exceptional disciplined approach to expense management. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Eric Wolfe with Citi. Eric Wolfe : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. You mentioned in your presentation the potential for bad debt and other income to add to revenue growth next year. I know it's still early, but could you just give us a sense for what you're thinking about that potential? For other income, I would assume it's mainly tied to the WiFi program. So we think there's some good visibility there, but correct me I'm wrong. Bob Garechana : Yes. Eric, it's Bob. I'll start, and Michael might augment on some of the other income stuff. But starting with bad debt, we continue to expect to end 2024 around, call it, 1% or maybe slightly better than that of a percentage of revenue. So bad debt as a percentage of revenue. If normal is \u2013 normal, meaning pre-pandemic is around 50 basis points. The opportunity set is delta between there, right. We'll have to see what the progress looks like. We'll have to see what the court system looks like as to whether or not we get all the way there, but to kind of frame a construct of what the opportunity set or contributions incremental growth is, is somewhere between that 1% and back to normalcy. We'll give you more color as we get to the fourth quarter guidance as to what's embedded in our numbers overall. On the other income side, you're correct that a lot of it is \u2013 and we mentioned this, this will be a contributor to fourth quarter performance as well. But a lot of our initiatives were back-end loaded, in terms of their implementation, particularly the bulk WiFi and the adoption of the bulk WiFi. So that will start contributing in a more \u2013 it already has started in the third quarter, but will be more meaningful in the fourth quarter and will continue to contribute as you get into $25 million. With that will come a little bit of expense component, which I think you're familiar with in the industry when you implement this, but there should be good contribution that will be potential for being greater than what you saw in 2024 because of the timing of those rollouts. Eric Wolfe : Got it. That's helpful. And then you also talked about seeing more Sunbelt opportunities. I think you said low 5% cap rate range. We've seen a lot of volatility in the 10-year dropping below as I think it's 3.5%, now back up at 4.3%. I mean as it sort of oscillates back and forth, does that change your pricing that you're willing to transact at all? Or are you just less sort of focused on your short-term cost of capital? Alex Brackenridge : Hey Eric, it's Alex. Rates have moved so quickly. It's a little hard to assess that. But I will tell you that as of recently as last week, there were opportunities pricing at like 4.75-ish in markets like Denver and Dallas. So there's a lot of capital, a lot of people interested in apartments. Now we're at a 10 year, it's 4.3 something, maybe that changes a little bit. The reality is with the uncertainty about rates plus the election coming up, there isn't that much product on the market right now. I think this will be a feeling out process for everyone, as we see where things end up, but there's still all this capital. I think overall, the 5% cap rate feels pretty good to me looking forward. Eric Wolfe : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll move next to Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Hi, good morning. I guess, given the projections that you guys have for fourth quarter on blended leasing spreads, that's going to sort of bring the figure in somewhere just under 2% for the year, and that's down about 100 basis points from the 2023 number. So as we kind of think out into next year, I know supply is coming down, but it's still relatively heavy, and you still have deliveries that are kind of working through the back half of this year that haven't been fully absorbed. So I'm just curious, is it your expectation that leasing spreads could actually hold next year? Or do you think with slowing economy, slowing job growth. And still some heavy deliveries that leasing spreads likely moderate again next year? Michael Manelis : Hey Steve, this is Michael. Maybe I'll just start and just say. So first, we're just \u2013 we're in the very early stages of our kind of budget process that we're putting in all those factors that you just described. In terms of the leasing spreads and how to think about this, I revert back to kind of this Page 5 in the management presentation that really talks more about just the pricing trend and what's happening with absolute market rent growth, kind of on a year-over-year basis because that's really going to be the catalyst that's going to drive a lot of that. Right now, a lot of the factors for the setup for 2025 feel very similar as we were heading into 2024 and how we talked about it. But I still think it's a little bit too early for me to kind of give you the guidance on where we think intra-period like market rent is going to grow. But I don't \u2013 I mean we have a lot of things that are set up to be catalyst for us, but we also know we still got to work through some of the absorption of supply in some of these markets. So I think we'll just see kind of how this plays out for the next couple of quarters. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And then maybe on the expense side, kind of following up on Eric's question about the WiFi. I know you get the benefits of revenue, but there's also a cost associated with that. You guys have done a very good job keeping expenses down around the 3% level. Is that growth rate achievable next year, you think, with kind of these added expenses? Or is it likely that we see a little bit of pressure on the expense side just due to the pickup in other income revenue growth? Mark Parrell : Hey Steve, it's Mark. You may see a little pressure above that 3%. We talked about on the last call, we've got still pressure from the 421-a burn-off of the tax abatement in New York. So it will be a little there. Certainly, the inflation numbers this morning were a little discouraging. So there may just continue to be some cost pressure. But whatever that number is, we'll be at the low end of it. And I think we'll quantify it for you, so you know exactly what the WiFi impact is. And of course, there's an offsetting much more significant revenue benefit. But I guess, it wouldn't surprise me if the number was a little bit higher than the number we're going to put up this year. But we're still rolling numbers up. Steve Sakwa : All right, thank you. Operator : We'll go next to the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Haendel St. Juste: Hey, good morning, guys. So first question, I guess, was just on the portfolio performance during the quarter. Maybe you could kind of walk us through how that evolves over the course of the third quarter. It seemed like there was a bit of a drop there in December in new lease rates. And maybe as we look ahead to the fourth quarter, I think new lease rates are expected to fall to about negative 4% from the minus 1% in the third quarter. So I'm looking for some color on kind of where you see perhaps the incremental drag? I'm pretty sort of San Francisco and Seattle pretty easy comps given last year's performance. Michael Manelis : Yes, good morning, Haendel, this is Michael. So I think what I would start and just say is let's just back up and think about the third quarter. So what we saw in the third quarter and it was really the later part of the third quarter is, we've had an occupancy kind of bias. We've been leaning into that. And specific to really the city of Los Angeles and the expansion markets, we did drop some of the rates, we increased some of the concession usage. And you can kind of see that on Page 5 in that pricing trend where you just didn't have as much robust kind of pricing power near the tail end of the quarter. And that translated right into that new lease change for us for the number. Where we sit here now in October, right, we've got a setup where you do \u2013 like you said, we have a little bit of an easier comp coming at us in Seattle and San Francisco. I've got a market like Los Angeles, right now have rents on top of prior year, and that's a condition we haven't seen all year long. So now you look at the October stats and you feel like you're pretty well positioned, but I've said before, right, these metrics are best viewed over a longer period of time versus kind of any stand-alone month, especially kind of given the quantities. And like specific to the fourth quarter and like our assumptions for that blended rate growth between 75 and 125 basis point growth. We have fairly stable achieved renewal rate increases kind of expected, and we are allowing for some continued moderation of new lease change. But the setup right now in the first month, we still got two-thirds of the quarter to get through feels pretty good to us. Mark Parrell : Yes. And Haendel, it's Mark. Just to add to that a little bit. This is a give-and-take type process. I mean, we can get new lease rate to be a higher number by letting occupancy decline, and that may not benefit same-store revenue growth, which is our ultimate goal. So we're trying to make as much money as we can in the current quarter and have a nice setup for the next year. But just viewing one factor either in one month or in \u2013 without context to the other ideas. If we were hurting on blended rate and hurting on occupancy. That would be a much more serious situation for us than what happened in September, which thus was just a blip around the average. Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. Thanks for the color. And then one on the Blackstone transaction. It looks like you guys used a bit more debt proportionately to fund that, I'm assuming capitalizing on lower debt costs, as you highlighted the unsecured issuance, but also the opportunity in your underlevered balance sheet. So maybe can you talk about the appetite for using a bit more leverage to fund acquisitions in the near-term? And then maybe some color on the IRR that you underwrote the Blackstone portfolio for? Thanks. Bob Garechana : Yes. So I'll start with the balance sheet, and then I'll pass it over to Alex to talk about the IRR. But we have an incredible, as you pointed out, incredibly underlevered and strong balance sheet. As you may recall, and as those on the call may recall, we have spent a long time frankly, warehousing capital looking for opportunities. And we warehouse capital by paying down debt and going well below our own targeted kind of debt metrics of net debt to EBITDA of 5 to 6 times. And so when the opportunity presented itself on Alex side, we capitalized on that by using the debt capacity we had, and further capitalize on it by the fact that we were able to do so at a very attractive rate overall, particularly with the use of proceeds. So we think that there is a lot more capacity given where the metrics I just outlined and the fact that we're sitting at, call it, 4.6 times. And we would look to use that debt capacity to take advantage of opportunities that make good long-term sense to lock in a really good cost of capital and allow for P&L accretion over time. Alex Brackenridge : And Haendel, in terms of IRR, we underwrite to an unlevered IRR, and then we compare it to our weighted average cost of capital. In this case, with that unlevered IRR was about an 8%, which at that time was in excess of the WACC at that point. Haendel St. Juste: Thank you guys. Operator : We'll go next to the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning. Morning out there. Bob, maybe just sticking with the balance sheet for a minute. You guys are one of the REITs that's got an active CP program, obviously, you take advantage of the unsecured debt markets. Can you just walk us through the difference in the two programs as far as the underlying rate? And does using more CP impact your ability to \u2013 the pricing that you get on unsecured? Or how about alternating between the two programs? Bob Garechana : Yes. So I guess, let me step back and make sure I got the question. But commercial paper for us is kind of short-term floating rate exposure that we use to deal with working capital cycles and working capital for us really means transaction volume. And so the CP program is \u2013 we'll use a portion of it. We use it in the construct of our overall capital structure to balance how much floating rate we have, et cetera, and it much cheaper than our line of credit, right? So we can borrow at, call it, SOFR plus 20 basis points and the line of credit would be contractually SOFR plus 75 or so. But we're really toggling between short-term and long-term issuance when it comes to like the unsecured market by balancing a bunch of factors, right? How much floating rate exposure, what does our liquidity profile look like? What does our maturity profile look like? What does the whole thing look like coupled together, and balancing that out? And because we've done such a great job on the balance sheet over the years and extended our duration and have a lot of capacity to have some short-term usage and some long-term components, we can use a little bit of all pockets to reduce our aggregate cost of capital, which is the goal overall. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then second question is, you guys seem to be more hopeful on Seattle and San Francisco. Over the past few years, there have been a lot of companies that have announced return to office and it's fizzled out. And obviously, we've all been collectively hoping for a rebound of Seattle and San Fran for the past few years. What gives the team on the ground confidence that this time, the return-to-office mandates and some of the positiveness that you've seen in those two markets are actually finally truly taking hold versus this could be sort of a false start that we've seen before? Michael Manelis : Yes. Alex, this is Michael. I could start off here. So first, I just spent a week in San Francisco, and you could feel it and the on-site teams will tell you just based on the prospects that are showing up for the tours, what\u2019s driving some of that. So the migration patterns show people from further out coming back near in, when they walk into the office, they're talking about the fact that they need to be back into the office for work several days a week, and that's driving a lot of their decisions. So it's still a little bit early, I would say, in San Francisco to feel it. But when you have the big company like Salesforce making that announcement, you see the activity in the ground and the office is from the prospect. A lot of the other peripheral companies start to follow some of those bigger tech companies. And this is probably the most serious we've seen them actually talk about all of this in the marketplace. Specific to Seattle, I'll tell you, we could see it like job postings from some of the major tech providers in that market are up in the city of Seattle, job postings in Bellevue, Redmond are up. Our on-site team, we've been talking to them like every week for the past several weeks once that Amazon announcement came out. And the Amazon employees are trying to get out in front of that January start date because they're concerned that there's going to be this pent-up demand coming in, and that either the rates or the availability of certain apartments won't be there in the marketplace. So they're actually buying early from us. So we could see it right now, and Seattle just feels a little bit further along than San Francisco from that, and we feel like Amazon is really kind of serious about what they're saying to their teams. Mark Parrell : And a little of this, Alex, it's Mark, is premised on our perspective, gleaned from the Moody's Analytics numbers for next year, that there's going to be some good job growth in the Bay Area in terms of office-using jobs. The barriers shed a lot of tech jobs and the jobs that have been added in AI have not been sufficient to offset those jobs, but we're hopeful that, that reverses itself. So I think when you talk quality of light, Seattle is definitively better. I've been there recently as well, same thing. San Francisco is better but not quite as good. I think LA is less advanced in quality of life considerations being addressed. And then you got this job overlay. And I think on the job overlay side, you feel pretty good about Seattle and you're feeling better about San Francisco and a little bit of what you saw in the third quarter for us was LA being a little sideways on jobs. So we do need that ingredient to come through for these markets to fully recover, but we feel that, we see that. Those are great industries, and I think they will attract and start to hire again if the economy keeps churning. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to John Pawlowski with Green Street. John Pawlowski : Hey, thanks for the time. Michael, I wanted to pick up on that conversation in Seattle. I'm just trying to help \u2013 can you just frame it with some specific metrics so we understand kind of the night and day difference. Just trying to get a sense of it's a surge of kind of foot traffic applicants or just a steady trickle post-Amazon announcement? Michael Manelis : Well, I mean, I think we saw these trends in migration patterns even last quarter, and we did put some good details on Page 8 in the management presentation that talk about kind of not only that urban suburban mix, but what we're actually seeing the fact that concessions are down 40% year-over-year. But I think we've seen some of these migration patterns. We've heard some of this before from our new residents moving in. And I think when you look at what the comp looks like, the comp line of our pricing trends for the fourth quarter, this time last year, we were issuing concessions, right? We had rents decelerating. And right now, while you're still seeing some normal kind of rent deceleration there, the concession use is actually kind of abating or softening a little bit in the downtown kind of submarkets. So, I think we're just seeing what we would describe as like the greenest shoots that we've seen and felt in a while. John Pawlowski : Okay. And then a question on L.A. in terms of the overhang on market vacancy and market rents from the eviction backlog, not just in your portfolio, but surrounding competitors. What's your best sense of the inning we're in on that overhang on market fundamentals? And when do you think the Anvil on market rate and occupancy will finally be gone? Michael Manelis : Yes. So John, this is Michael. That's a hard thing to understand exactly when we think we'll be kind of back to normal. I feel like when you just look at the sheer number of quantities of kind of pending evictions in the marketplace that we have. We are more than kind of two thirds of the way through kind of our backlog. It was a positive sign for us to see that the duration dropped to four months from kind of the six-month average that we saw early in the quarter. But we really need to see another drop down to probably like two months for it to get back to like that normal swing of things. So my guess is, we think about our modeling for next year with L.A. besides some of those top line drivers that Mark just talked about, besides the fact that we have rents on top of prior year, we'll see how kind of how they hold up. We really are looking now at probably another couple of quarters of this pressure from this excess inventory in the market. But when you look at the occupancy for the quarter, positive is that while we're getting some of this excess inventory occurring, we are able to rent those units out and we are getting new residents in that pay the rent. So that's a positive to us. It's just taking us a little bit longer to backfill some of those units than you otherwise would have had in normal market conditions. John Pawlowski : Thanks, Michael. Operator : Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Mark Parrell : Good morning. John Kim : You talked about the net migration trends being favorable to Seattle and San Francisco. Where are the residents coming from? Is this a reversal of the Sunbelt migration you've seen in the last few years? Michael Manelis : Yes. John, it's Michael. So it's not so much the migration is happening or in migrations happening from out of state. What we're seeing is the migration patterns are shifting from being 20-plus miles out coming near in. So it could even be within the same MSA, they're just coming near or in to us. So that's another source of demand for us. You are seeing kind of some out-of-state in migration occur, but it's still not back to like what we saw in like the pre-pandemic era. We're still slightly elevated from getting more of our new residents from within the MSA. John Kim : Okay. My second question is on the Blackstone acquisition. I realize it's immediately accretive to earnings. You bought it below replacement costs. But the operating environment in your expansion markets are going backwards, maybe more quicker than you anticipated. Could you have waited on acquiring assets in these markets given NOI is going negative in some of these markets? Mark Parrell : Yes. It's Mark. Boy, I wish we were that present. We've talked before on the trade-off here, you're going to get some weaker gross rental growth numbers, but you're going to get a better price now and then we'll likely continue to be a buyer, and you'll probably pay a higher price and you'll have less of that rental growth weakness. Frankly, it's very, very early on that deal, but everything is tracking very consistently to slightly better than our numbers in a pro forma. So again, the Sunbelt is weak, we expected it to be weak. Those are pretty well exactly as weak as we thought they'd be. And again, we do run things differently. Michael is an excellent operator, and he and his team, there are things we can do better in terms of delinquency management and vacancy management that even if rents are going down, we can underwrite, and we see those sorts of improvements. So I guess I don't have any regrets about the timing, because I think your dollar cost little into this I think we really love our basis here with that kind of replacement cost discount. And I think in a few quarters, you're going to start to see some improvement in the second derivative in the Sunbelt, but it's going to take a while for our big three Sunbelt markets to see significant improvement in same-store revenue. We did assume that would take a little bit longer. Alex Brackenridge : And John, it's Alex. We are in just those specific three Sunbelt markets, two when you think of Denver being outside the Sunbelt, not in some of the markets that are just seeing massively historic amounts of oversupply. So our \u2013 we feel like there's a little more digestible over time. We are not \u2013 we have not been buying in Austin as an example, where we do have three properties, but we're standing pat because the amount of supply is just sold for whaling. John Kim : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Ami Probandt : Hi, this is Ami on for Michael. Have you been seeing the same in-migration trends for the East Coast markets as you've been seeing in the Seattle or San Francisco? Michael Manelis : Ami, this is Michael. So really, when you look across the East Coast markets, our migration patterns are very much in line with pre-pandemic kind of norms, both from how we're actually attaining new residents and we also watch when residents leave us where are they going, both the out migration and the immigration patterns across those East Coast markets very much in line with historical norms that we saw back in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Ami Probandt : Okay. And then one on bad debt. How are the bad debt new levels of bad debt, so for new residents coming in the door, bad debt levels presidents trending? Is this in line with historical or elevated below normal? Bob Garechana : Yes, it's Bob. So in terms of new entrants from a bad debt standpoint, it's very wise. So it's normalized back to pre-pandemic levels. So the quantity of nonpaying residents that are coming in the front door, has very much normalized back to new \u2013 to pre-pandemic levels. The thing you have to keep in mind and the thing that we keep in mind as we manage this is that if eviction processes take longer, each one of those quantity of people actually still cost more. So we have a bunch of initiatives and technology that we utilize to try to actually make it lower than normal to the extent that we think the eviction process is going to be extended. But in terms of quality of resident kind of getting at that level, it's still very high quality, still low percentage of people coming through that don't pay. Ami Probandt : Thank you. Operator : We'll go now to Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Unidentified Analyst : It's [indiscernible] along with Nick. Maybe following up on John's question from earlier. Alex, how are you underwriting rent growth on new acquisitions today in those higher supply markets? And I think you mentioned flat in the first year or two, but that probably assumes some high growth in the out year. So curious how you were maybe just generally private market players are baking in that rent growth to get the IRR math to work? Alex Brackenridge : Hey, Daniel, it's Alex. So every property is a little different, but certainly, all three markets are seeing higher than historic supply. So over \u2013 across the board, the first year has always been less, a little bit less than what the prior year was. The second year is maybe flattish to a little bit less. But part of that is offset by operating efficiencies that we have from our platform and other income that we're layering in. So the net-net is an improvement by the end of the second year. And then we do think that in years three and four, we will see outsized growth. So if you thought the historic norm might be 3%, 3.5%, I think 4.5% is going to be highly achievable. And so we do factor that in \u2013 depending a little bit on the approximate supply for each asset, but that's generally the trend that we show. Unidentified Analyst : Sorry, I was on mute. I appreciate that. And then I had a follow-up maybe for Mark. Just wanted to ask your high-level thinking on the election, different legislative things. Are there different \u2013 like what are the variables maybe you're focused on? Maybe what's less topical now? And do you think maybe could be more topical next week or next year? Mark Parrell : Yes. Thanks for that question. I mean, of course, the federal election is getting a lot of notice. I will say state and local government is generally more impactful to our business. And so most of our focus and the industry's focus has been on Proposition 33 in California, and we've been very active there, and we remain optimistic that Californians will reject for the third time this sort of anti-housing rent control proposal. So that is certainly topical. Depending on the President, there is a difference in approach there. The federal government has important levers it can pull in terms of the GSEs, Fannie and Freddie, and how they put capital into the market and FHA and HUD as well. So I guess that's an impact. So we'll have to see all that settle out. And then, of course, whoever is President will inherit some challenging budget circumstances, and we'll see how that impacts things like the voucher programs, expansions of the which is the low income housing program. Middle income housing tax credit program in the industry is advocating for. So there's a lot of topics on the table that I hope in a week, we know a little bit more certainty. But the main discussions that the industry is having right now and the main focus are the state ballot initiative in California. And we've had some terrific lock across the country in the last year or so, whether it's the Massachusetts housing bill, which was very supply focused, very much trying to generate affordable housing, whether it's in Florida, a very different government there, of course, their housing bill, which again focused on supply and zoning reform, California, transit-oriented development, Governor is focused on. So I think everyone gets the message about supply being a solution. I think the industry has just got to push that, whether it's the federal or state level, as well as voucher enhancement in public-private partnerships like 421-a and the BTI [ph] program in Seattle and things like that. So again, I think we're going to have a great dialogue when the smoke clears, but for a week or maybe a little longer, there's going to be a little uncertainty. Unidentified Analyst : Right. Thanks for the time. Operator : We'll go next to Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Adam Kramer : Great. Thanks for the time. I wanted to ask maybe a couple of quick ones. Where is the loss to lease in the portfolio today? And where are you sending out renewals for November, December here? Michael Manelis : Hey, Adam, this is Michael. So first, I'll just start off. So the loss to lease \u2013 and maybe I'll just back up. So at the beginning of the year, we actually started in a moderate gain to lease position at about 60 basis points. And then as that pricing can kind of improve kind of we moved ourselves back into a loss to lease position. As of kind of the middle of the month, October 15, we were in a slight gain to lease of about 10 basis points which, again, it kind of tells us that we're going to wind up at the end of the year in a normal range. Because any given year, you can start in a slight gain or a slight loss to lease position, but that's kind of where we're positioned right now. We do have a little bit of that easier comp in the fourth quarter in a couple of these markets. So we'll see kind of how that plays into the final year-end number. In terms of the renewals, right now, our quotes are out in the marketplace for the next 90 days. We still expect to continue to renew a high percentage of our residents. We put some stats in there. We've been really focused on that, the customer service side of the business and leveraging our centralized team. With the quotes that are out in the marketplace that are around a 6.5% or 7%, we expect to achieve around a 4.7% renewal increase, or a little bit better because, obviously, if the markets continue to improve some of those West Coast markets, we have the ability to kind of dial down some of the negotiations that we're doing, which could produce a little bit higher results in the quarter for us. Adam Kramer : Great. That's really helpful, Michael. Thank you. And just maybe switching gears on kind of external growth, maybe a two-parter here. I guess first part is just when you're thinking about dispositions going forward, which markets are you focused on? And then the second part of that is, obviously, pretty quite here with this large portfolio. Is there more to come? And if so, is it kind of more on the one-off side of things? Or is there the potential for kind of further portfolio opportunities here? Alex Brackenridge : Hey, Adam, it's Alex. First, on the dispo question. As we've talked about in the past, we are focused on decreasing the exposure in California, and we've done that recently, and we'll continue to do that. We'd also decreased more in the urban core of a couple of other cities as well outside of California. It's just not a great bid right now for that yet. But we're starting to hear requests for information about properties. We're talking to people who are kind of taking a contrarian view. But as you know, we're never in a position where we have to sell something. So we're just kind of waiting for the market to come to us a little bit on that. But I think you'll see us continue to spread our footprint into these expansion markets and then within our coastal markets become more \u2013 a little bit more suburban than we are right now. So a little more urban, but brought the market to come to us a little bit, and we have the ability to sell other assets while we're waiting for that to happen. In terms of the one-offs versus portfolios, we're out there trying to create opportunity every day. That's how the Blackstone deal came about, and we're talking to any of the major developers or owners and we would love to do business and volume. And if not, we'll keep doing the one-offs, but we expect to be able to find more opportunities like the Blackstone deal. Adam Kramer : Great. Thanks for the time. Operator : We'll go next to the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Josh Dennerlein : Hey guys. I just wanted to follow up on one of the opening remarks about the resident AI rollout and how you're going to get to 75%, 80% coverage pretty shortly. I guess \u2013 just how should we think about the benefits of this rollout impacting the P&L? And then maybe any thoughts on potential margin improvement opportunity here? Michael Manelis : Hey, Josh, this is Michael. So maybe I'll start with the first one and just talk about like what we're doing. So we were early pioneers of kind of leveraging AI into our leasing process. We did that back in 2019. And you saw that benefit almost immediately in the reduction of on-site kind of payroll or mitigating payroll growth on site as we continue to centralize a lot of those kind of customer experiences. Right now, in this last quarter, what we're doing is we're actually rolling out an AI tool that deals with resident inquiries \u2013 questions that residents have not necessarily prospects. And what we hope to see with that is that as these kind of machine learning applications get in there, they get better and better. Out of the box, we started with like 60% coverage of being able to answer inquiries from our residents. We think over the next couple of quarters, we'll get to that 75%, 80%. And really, what you get then is you get another layer of operating efficiencies, whether that's the on-site side, where we're able to kind of pot or flex staff across multiple properties even further than what we've already done or you start looking into our centralized teams and you say where can we create efficiencies there so we could take on new tasks. So we're really excited. And again, this is something that we're never done with, but you're seeing some of these applications come to the market that really do have a pretty quick impact on the operations of the company. And the second part of your question, I just want to make sure I understood. Were you talking about like market upside? Josh Dennerlein : No. I guess, sorry, just like margin expansion opportunity across the portfolio, it seems like this might generate some expense savings. So just trying to think about the opportunity set here? Mark Parrell : Yes. I'm not sure, it's Mark. How much margin improvement as much as it is just blunting the rate of inflation, I mean, you've got a fair bit of growth of just various costs, I mean just break payroll as well as medical and the rest of it. And I think what you've seen us do is kind of hold those costs to sub-inflationary levels. And when we do that and we grow revenue, that's the margin improvement. But again, we seek to be closer to 70% better in that number, but a little bit of this is just being, and I think Bob Garechana said it well on the last call, whatever you think inflation is, we're a little bit below it. And this is part of that sort of effort. Josh Dennerlein : Thanks guys. Operator : We'll go next to the line of Julien Blouin with Goldman Sachs. Julien Blouin : Yes. Thank you for the question. Bob, you talked about an openness to continue to deploy leverage capacity here. Maybe, I guess, bigger picture, I get the geographic mix reasons for the acquisitions. But why does now feel like the right time to be deploying your leverage capacity into acquisitions when maybe the spread between cap rates and your cost of debt remains at some of the tightest levels in maybe the last decade? Mark Parrell : Interesting. It's Mark. I'm going to start, and Alex may add to it. Cap rates aren't the only inputs to this calculus. I mean replacement cost is really important, too. And as we've said on prior calls, the replacement cost thing isn't just about buying an asset at a good basis; it means that's unlikely to be a lot of supply there because it's not an economic incentive to build. So there is, in our minds probably much better revenue growth prospects especially in the outer years, as Alex just described, years three and four than what we've underwritten. And so that's a little bit of what we're buying as well here. In terms of the spread between our cost of funds and the disposition assets and the like, you also have to think about CapEx. The assets we're buying generally are pretty new and have relatively little capital. You saw us sell and we'll continue to sell these much older assets with a bigger capital load. So when you think about AFFO kind of yields, those are better, then they look on the surface on the FFO side. So I think there's a few things going on here. And I also say apartments are such a desirable and liquid asset class, the idea that you're going to get like you do in some other sectors that are less well owned these gaps between your cost of capital and what you can invest at, that's just not realistic. We just don't see that happen often or at all in the last, I guess, almost decade. So I guess I'd end with that comment that, that sort of view would be great if it happened. But I think some other sectors have that happen a lot more, and that means that frankly, they don't trade very well in the private market. And our assets do trade really well in our super liquid, and that means they tend to compress to the cost of capital more quickly. Julien Blouin : Got it. And maybe sort of thinking about the other potential use of capital development. I know your view sort of over an entire cycle that acquisitions produced sort of better risk-adjusted returns on your capital. But I guess at this point in the cycle, why not maybe tilt more aggressively towards developments? I know you expect to complete $780 million in 2024 and 2025. But I guess, why not sort of bring that a little bit higher? Alex Brackenridge : Hey Julien, it's Alex. The markets that we're particularly interested in like Denver, Dallas and Atlanta have all the supply coming. So sure, we could look at building into those markets. But I'm not really sure that that's the most best risk-adjusted return that we're going to get when you look at the amount of opportunity we're going to have to kind of cherry big properties that really work well for us. So our development instead is focused on places where we don't see those buying opportunities. And that's why you saw us with starts in suburban Seattle and suburban Boston, where we looked historically at how hard it was to amass a portfolio with one-off acquisitions. Julien Blouin : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Jamie Feldman : Thanks. I know we've covered a lot of ground here. I guess, just thinking about insurance, I know your renewal doesn't come up until March, but can you give us any initial thoughts just where you think property insurance or commercial property insurance rates are heading and what your conversations be? Mark Parrell : Hey Jamie, it's Mark. Coincidently, I was just talking to the risk management team yesterday about that. So our renewal on our property is done in March of each year. And just to remind everyone, our increase was about 10% year-over-year, and that included us enhancing increasing our coverage a bit as well. So we had a pretty good renewal we thought. And remember we didn't have those giant renewals, a lot of the folks with more hurricane exposure. We don't own in places that have windstorm risk, so that's a huge benefit to us. But having spoken through our risk management team to ensure the two big stores this year, people don't feel will have a big impact on 2025 renewals at this point because the insurers had apparently relatively little exposure to Helen, and the exposure that was triggered on Milton, which could be $50 billion of insurance losses was within what they thought they would underwrite to. So it appears to us that the insurance market was mostly prepared for what occurred. I can't give you an exact number because we're still rolling up budgets. But we don't see yet. We're not hearing from insurers that this is like after Hurricane Ian where there's sort of a catastrophic increase in insurance rates coming across the whole property sector. Jamie Feldman : Okay. Thank you for that. And then I guess just quickly for Bob, the debt coming due in 2025, any initial thought on timing of when you'll try to get after that? Bob Garechana : Yes. So we have about $500 million coming due, as you mentioned in 2025, which is kind of in the middle of the year. So we'll look at the market opportunistically. $500 million for a company of our size, our liquidity, our credit rating is not particularly large. So really, we'll just be opportunistic at how we minimize what that cost is. And we have a lot of \u2013 like I mentioned in response to some other questions. We have a lot of variables that we can pull in terms of tenor, in terms of size, in terms of all of that stuff and the maturity is in June, by the way. But we have a lot of \u2013 just a lot of leverage and a lot of excellent access to capital in the mix of tools that we can use. So very manageable. Jamie Feldman : Are there any types of instruments that look particularly interesting to you now? Bob Garechana : It's so volatile lately that it changes almost on a daily basis. Like the 10-year $600 million that wasn't that long ago that we did in September, when we kind of bottomed ticked the treasury of 3.75. That the 10-year look great, the spreads were low, and it was great. As the curve steepens, obviously, maybe a little bit of shorter tenders begin to become interesting right because you've got you're getting paid for that. And because our duration is so long and because we've got some 30 years outstanding, et cetera, we can take advantage of that. And to be honest with you, we also have \u2013 our target for floating rate exposure is around 15%. We're under that right now. And if the Fed does start cutting more aggressively, doesn't look like they will now, but they might it doesn't hurt to have a little bit of floating rate exposure, too. So it's a little bit of \u2013 it's good to have options. And I think we have a lot of options in seems like with the volatility in the markets right now that every day, something new is more interesting than it was the day before, and we'll have to see as we get closer to what the opportunity looks like. Jamie Feldman : Okay. Great. Thanks for your thoughts on it. Operator : Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Bob Garechana : Hey Linda are you there? We can\u2019t hear you. Linda Tsai : Sorry, if this question has been asked already. Is there a sense of when new lease spreads get more positive? Michael Manelis : Yes. Hey Linda, this is Michael. So the new lease spreads, there's a lot of seasonality that goes into that. And I think what you should expect, and we said this in the prepared remarks. And you can kind of look at Page 5 in that management presentation to understand how pricing trend curves throughout the year. But as we typically will start, we will decelerate in the fourth quarter with those spreads then you start into the first year, you'll start to get some acceleration in your pricing power and that usually then transfer results were the positive new lease spread somewhere in that kind of later first part of the first quarter. Linda Tsai : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Alex Kim with Zelman & Associates. Alex Kim : Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. I'm going to \u2013 piggyback off Julian's second question a bit here. Can you talk through what you're seeing in your expansion markets that makes them so attractive on a long-term system and then. I guess, just any other markets that you're looking at that fit that criteria as well? Alex Brackenridge : Hey Alex, it's Alex. We're really following our customer. We see these high-tech jobs in marketplaces that didn't use to have them in volume like Denver, Dallas and Atlanta an example. And so we're \u2013 that will be the principle that guides us. And we continue to see good numbers coming out of those places, particularly Dallas, which has been fantastic recently in terms of the demand side. Other markets that we've talked about are specific to North Carolina, Charlotte and Raleigh because they have many of those very same dynamics with the really great tech job base, particularly in the Raleigh area and then more finance in Charlotte. But we've been slow to get going on that because like Austin, the amount of supply is just daunting. And when that really gets absorbed, it's hard to project right now. So we're willing to accept some dilution, but there's a limit to how much we want to accept. So I think you might see us enter those markets in a little bit when that becomes a little more clear. Alex Kim : Got it. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : We go next to Rich Anderson with Wedbush. Rich Anderson : Hey, thanks. Good morning. So first question on the Blackstone deal. Bob, what's the longer- term out plan on the CP side of the financing? Bob Garechana : So in the near term, a good component of it will be disposition proceeds because it was \u2013 the CP balance was partially elevated just from timing and disposition. So we still have, call it, with our guidance like $400 million or so of dispositions that we have planned for the back half of this year or for the fourth quarter, could slip into early Q1 of next year. But that will bring our CP balance back to kind of what is the normal line that we call it $500 million to $700 million or keep it around that level. So it's really disposed. Rich Anderson : Okay. And then a bigger picture perhaps for Mark. In 2016, the company sold, not \u2013 it's probably not fair to call it all suburb or Sunbelt, but a chunk of Sunbelt to Barry Sternlich that was almost 10 years ago, and now you're kind of reversing course with the expansion today. Is this all a function of how tech business has moved in business-friendly climates have gotten better and other areas outside of, say, California and so on? Or is there something else that has caused the company to sort of arguably reverse course on the Sunbelt? And why you're doing this now versus the decision you made eight years ago? Thanks. Mark Parrell : Thanks, Rich. It's good to talk to someone who has such a long amount of history in our business. You look at every one of our competitors and their market mix is morphed. We may be more vocal and more communicative about it. The people have left tertiary markets and focus, they've left lower-end renters in Sunbelt markets and focused on higher. So just to be fair, I mean, really every company does adjust to circumstances and be among them. I would say several things changed. Regulatory risk became more significant in some of our coastal markets. And for a while, you might remember, we thought it was a big advantage because no could build in those markets. But it got challenging enough for some of those states and some of those jurisdictions became difficult. Alex mentioned following our customer, which is kind of our buy line. And our customer, there are more higher-end jobs in the Sunbelt markets like Atlanta than there was when we exited those markets. And the other part that goes with that is housings are lot more expensive in those places. So it used to be our best renter in Atlanta. They'd be with six months and they buy a home. And our worst rider would move out in the middle of the night and it was a pretty low quality tenancy, all right? And that's really changed. You go to these places and much higher quality job growth. So it was a combination of regulatory risk, following our residents and much higher single-family housing costs in desirable areas. Rich Anderson : Okay. Good luck. Thanks very much. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : We have no further questions. I'd like to turn the floor back to Mark Parrell for any additional or closing remarks. Mark Parrell : Thanks, Melinda. As we close the call, I want to thank my colleagues at our Augusta, Georgia Accounting Center for the work above and beyond the call of duty to close our books in the aftermath of what Hurricane Helene's terrible damage was to that city. I salute all of you and the folks in the counting here in Chicago; we picked up the slack and got all our quarter end financial work done on time. There are other conference call listeners, thanks for your time today, and we'll see you on the conference circuit for the rest of the year. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Marty McKenna. Please go ahead, sir. Marty McKenna : Good morning, and thanks for joining us to discuss Equity Residential's fourth quarter 2024 results. Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer.

Mark Parrell : Thank you, Marty. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2024 results and outlook for 2025. I will start us off then Michael Manelis, our COO will speak to our 2024 operating performance and 2025 revenue guidance. Then Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer will cover our 2025 expense and NFFO guidance. Then we'll go ahead and take your questions. We also posted a management presentation to our website last night with some additional detail. Before I get to the meat of my remarks, I want to spend a minute thanking my colleagues in the Los Angeles market for all they've done to support our residents and each other during this very difficult time. We are fortunate to have not had any property seriously impacted by the fires, but our teams and everyone else in LA has been through a lot. A special shout out to all the firefighters, first responders and everyone else worked tirelessly to battle the blazes. Now turning to 2024, we finished the year with solid same store revenue results that were a good bit better than the midpoint of what we had expected at the beginning of the year. But with slowing bad debt improvement in the fourth quarter leaving us at the lower end of our previously upwardly revised guidance expectations. Demand remains very good across our portfolio with levels of supply the main determinant of market performance. Before putting 2024 in the rearview mirror, I want to thank my colleagues across our 300 plus properties and at corporate who once again did a great job managing expense growth while providing outstanding customer service. We are very proud of delivering same store expense growth in 2024 of 2.9% and delivering an average of only 3.2% same store expense growth over the past five years. Well done team. And now moving on to 2025. While we're expecting similar annual same store revenue growth in 2025 as last year, the pace of our same store quarter-over-quarter revenue growth should show acceleration throughout the year, with the back half of 2025 considerably better than the first half. In contrast, the deceleration in quarterly growth we saw in 2024. In both our earnings release and in the management presentation we provided guidance for our 2025 operations. Michael and Bob are going to provide some color on that guidance in just a minute, but I want to take a moment to talk about the economic outlook that supports these guidance expectations. Based on the third party economic projections we use, we expect office using job growth, which we see as a key driver of our business, to be higher in 2025 than in 2024, especially on the West Coast. The improvement we are seeing in our downtown Seattle operations and beginning to see in the San Francisco market, both downtown and on the Peninsula are consistent with that theme. Unemployment of college graduates, the bulk of our residents, is currently very low at 2.4% and we expect it to stay in that range in 2025. With the supply of housing already tight in most of our markets, we see this setup is very positive for our business. I also note that our current earnings guidance is driven by the positive signs we are seeing looking at our operating dashboards as well as our deep knowledge of supply and demand dynamics in our markets rather than by looking at the headlines. While we certainly acknowledge that there is a higher level of uncertainty in the forward path of the economy than usual, given various recent governmental actions relating to tariffs and other matters, the impact of these actions on the larger economy in our business is hard to estimate currently, will evolve over time and is not included in our guidance expectations. That said, being a strong cash flow business without foreign operations and with a fortress balance sheet in times of heightened uncertainty is a definitive positive. We're looking at supply in our coastal established markets where we have 90% of our net operating income. We expect completions of competitive units to be similar in 2025-2024, but at a considerably lower level as a percentage of existing apartment inventory than in the Sunbelt markets. With some localized exceptions that Michael will discuss, we expect this coastal supply to be absorbed well in these housing starved markets. So while 2025 will be similar to 2024 in terms of established market units delivered that are competitive with our properties, overall supply levels continue to be manageable. While there continues to be a lot of conversation about declines in Sunbelt starts, we think it is at least as notable that 2024 competitive starts and our coastal footprint were about half of normal levels with 2025 starts likely to be similarly restrained. In fact, as a percentage of existing inventory total starts in our established markets in 2024 were at rock bottom levels last seen just after the great financial crisis. As a result, we see 2026 total deliveries in our coastal markets around 30% lower than the pre pandemic average. In sum, the supply versus demand setup is good in our coastal markets now and will likely trend even better later this year and into 2026. Turning to our expansion markets in Atlanta, Austin, Dallas and Denver where we have about 10% of our net NOI, we expect 2025 deliveries to be lower than in 2024 but still at an elevated level. We also expect that in 2025 these markets will still be working off the supply delivered in 2024. Overall demand remains good in our expansion markets and these high job growth markets will eventually absorb the current and incoming supply, but it will take some time to do so and progress we think will be uneven. In a moment Michael will go over what we are currently seeing in these markets. When we apply all this to our capital allocation strategy, it confirms to us again the wisdom of having a strategically diversified portfolio. Our goal is to own an apartment portfolio that has the highest long term total return in the sector with a focus on cash flow growth, taking into account risk and minimizing volatility. We are achieving this goal by catering to well earning renters in the 12 or so metro areas that we think have the most desirable lifestyles for this demographic and present the best balance of long term demand, supply, regulatory and resiliency opportunities and risks and where we can efficiently operate our properties with our industry leading people and systems. We made substantial progress towards our goal of having 20% of our NOI in our expansion markets by investing almost $2 billion in acquisitions and delivered development projects in these markets during 2024 while disposing of about $1 billion of older assets located entirely in our coastal markets. Our portfolios in the expansion markets feature newer, well located properties with a healthy balance between suburban and urban. We have given guidance for $1.5 billion of acquisitions and $1 billion of dispositions in 2025. As you can see, we expect to fund the bulk of our acquisition activity using proceeds from dispos. We are also assuming in our guidance that we will be a net acquirer and that we will fund that net acquisition activity using debt. You should expect material net acquisition activity only if like in 2024 where we acquired $600 million using debt. The numbers support that activity. Currently, transaction activity is very light. Assuming market volatility abates, we would hope that activity would pick up. Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, is here in the Q&A period to add color. Finally, I wish to thank Barry Altshuler, our Regulatory Affairs Guru and others across the rental housing industry for doing an outstanding job advocating for pro housing solutions like less regulation and better public private partnerships to encourage more supply and against anti housing ideas like rent control. We had great success in California and across the country last quarter. Equity Residential will continue to be a leader with its industry partners in advancing pro housing policies while political risk remains in our markets. We have definitively seen the tide turn towards more thoughtful housing policies and a focus on quality of life and public safety in our central cities. And with that I'll turn the call over to Michael Manelis. Michael Manelis : Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This morning, I will review our fourth quarter 2024 operating performance and our operating outlook for 2025. In addition to our earnings release published last night, we've also published a detailed management presentation that provides additional color on the drivers of our guidance that I will refer to. We ended the year with continued healthy fundamentals and solid demand from a well-employed renter population, which drove strong occupancy of 96.1% and a blended rate growth of 1% both of which met our forecast for the quarter. I'd also like to highlight that our fourth quarter turnover was just 9%, bringing our full year turnover to 42.5%, which is the lowest we have reported in our 30-year history as a public company. This clearly demonstrates our success in creating remarkable resident experiences and reflects the favorable supply demand dynamics in our portfolio. On the expense side, for the full year, we have kept growth in same-store operating expenses below 3% with a special call out to the relatively flat payroll growth and 2% growth in repairs and maintenance including a 5.5% reduction in turnover expense. This again highlights our ability to share resources across properties and minimize reliance on outsourced labor. We are pleased to report that two-thirds of our properties have a shared resource model in place, and we're excited about the additional opportunities that further automation and centralization provide. Moving to 2025. Our same-store revenue growth guidance range is 2.25% to 3.25%, with an expense rate growth range of 3.5% to 4.5%. Bob will provide color on the expense guidance in a moment, but let me focus your attention on the building blocks for revenue growth as detailed on Page 6 of the management presentation. Our revenue midpoint assumes the following : we start with embedded growth of 80 basis points in 2025, this is 40 basis points lower than our starting point in 2024 and at the lower end of the historical averages, but the gap is largely expected to be made up through stronger leasing activity during 2025. That strong leasing activity will be driven by continued strength in overall demand from better job growth forecasted in our markets and very manageable levels of competitive new supply particularly in our established markets, which are 90% of the total portfolio. This is expected to yield blended rate growth between 2% and 3% for the full year which is about 60 basis points better than what we delivered for the full year 2024, with a good portion of that improvement coming from the recovery of some of our West Coast markets that I will discuss later. We also expect continued strong resident retention as a result of both the benefits of a centralized renewal process, our enhanced data and analytics insights and the high cost and low availability of owned housing in our markets. As I said earlier, turnover in the portfolio remains the lowest that we have seen in the history of our company, and we expect that trend to continue in 2025. This leads to approximately 3% residential same-store revenue growth, which is identical to 2024, which is then partially offset by declines in nonresidential same-store revenue to get to the 2.75% midpoint of our guidance range, as described on Page 6 of the management presentation. Occupancy should hold at levels similar to last year, which at that strength will allow us to capture rate. Operating results will also benefit from our continued execution on innovation initiatives with the majority of it running through the other income line. This year, we will be focusing on our analytical efforts with data-driven pricing and retention strategies, expanding automation to drive additional operating efficiencies and all the while endeavoring to ensure that we provide a great customer experience. In 2025, we expect about 70 basis points or nearly $20 million in other income growth with a large majority of it coming from initiatives that we have discussed in the past and the further rollout of our Internet connectivity and technology programs. Bob will walk through the associated expenses with that, but net-net, these will be additive to earnings overall. In terms of the overall market performance, Seattle and DC should lead the pack with same-store revenue growth of approximately 4% and New York and San Francisco will follow very closely behind. While we did include some further recovery in downtown Seattle and San Francisco in our guidance, both markets have the potential to outperform if we get more robust pricing power early in the year. And our expansion markets, which reflect only 10% of the total company NOI, we expect to produce negative same-store revenue growth given the impact of elevated, albeit declining levels of supply that need to work through the system. As we look at the individual markets, let's start with Los Angeles, where I would like to echo Mark's comments with tremendous gratitude to our amazing team in this market. Our guidance does not assume potential operational impacts in either revenues or in terms of cleanup expenses from the fires that I will discuss in a moment. Here's what we have included. So first, the market will see more supply than it did in 2024, but we expect the impact on our portfolio to be manageable and consistent with last year, with the Mid-Wilshire, Koreatown submarket fueling the most competitive pressure followed by the San Fernando Valley, which will see an increase, but without significant impact to us. Our guidance assumes that the market will continue to work through delinquency and bad debt issues, which will contribute to additional revenue growth. As I'll discuss in a moment, depending on the regulatory actions taken in L.A., this improvement may happen more slowly than what is now assumed in our guidance. Physical occupancy and pricing trends started improving late last year, and we modeled a continued pace of improvement, which results in our full year same-store market revenue projection for L.A. to be around 3%, but again, this may be impacted by any regulatory limits put in place in response to the fires, which brings us to the potential impact from the virus. While there has been a lot of speculation, we believe it is still too early to understand the full impact on operations. There will likely be more demand in the market as fire impacted residents seek new accommodations, especially in the two and three bedroom units which comprise about 45% of our L.A. portfolio, which we have already seen in certain submarkets. There will also likely be cleanup expenses the company incurs from the fires and various governmental actions that could negatively impact our operations. There are also likely to be twist and turns in the recovery process and governmental response. For now, we feel like the base case we outlined is our best assumption. We'll keep you posted on what happens here and anticipate that we'll have a better color on our first quarter call in April. Staying on the West Coast, San Diego and Orange County were some of the better performers last year. In 2025, we expect that these markets will continue to see good demand. Job growth in both markets is expected to exceed 2024 levels, and there is a general lack of housing. High homeownership costs make renting in these markets the most attractive option. Both markets are expected to see slightly more competitive new supply in 2025. But overall, we would expect good performance here. In San Francisco, we are optimistic about the mayoral administration and its commitment to improving the quality of life in the city. Job growth expectations continue to improve, and demand in the downtown and Peninsula submarkets are strong which should lead to additional pricing power in 2025. As I mentioned a moment ago, we have modeled some improvement in the operating conditions for the overall market of San Francisco with growth primarily coming from both the Peninsula and downtown submarkets. A more robust recovery is certainly possible as demand and pricing improved early enough in the year. Currently, concession use remains elevated in the San Francisco market, especially in the downtown submarket but overall improved significantly in 2024. We expect with improving occupancy, we will begin to see net effective pricing improvements in the market as rents and occupancy are increasing, which will most likely lead to a further pullback in concessions if these occupancy gains hold. New supply forecast for 2025 in San Francisco is very similar to 2024 quantities with almost no supply in downtown San Francisco and most of it concentrated in the South Bay, where absorption has been strong. We also are feeling really good about Seattle in 2025. Despite heightened pockets of supply, particularly in the Urban Core and Redmond, some margin, we finished 2024 in a strong position and look to have increasing pricing power resulting from continued demand as employers like Amazon bring their teams back to the office and supply begins to abate in the second half of this year. Quality of life issues in the city continue to improve, and the city has a bounce in its step after a pretty good stretch in the doldrums. Competitive deliveries with our portfolio peaked in the fourth quarter of 2024, and our pricing power held up during a period of time when it normally declines. We expect Seattle to be one of our strongest revenue growth markets in 2025. Moving to the East Coast starting in Boston. With high occupancy and limited new competitive supply, this market should perform low in 2025. The market is supported by a strong employment base in finance, tech, life sciences, health and education. Overall, new deliveries will be about the same in 2025 as last year, but the majority of the deliveries will be in the suburbs, which bodes well for us, given 70% of our assets are located in the Urban Core Boston. Our urban assets outperformed suburban ones in 2024, and we expect that spread will be even greater in 2025. New York was a top performer in 2024, and we expect that to continue in 2025. The employment base is strong, market occupancy is high, and there's almost no new competitive supply being delivered in Manhattan, where we have the majority of our portfolio. Washington, D.C. was our top performer last year, and our expectations remain high for 2025. The absorption here has been very impressive, considering that the market has been delivering more than 10,000 units a year and will do so again in 2025. We're almost 97% occupied in the market, which is a good start to the year. And the wild color here is what impact the new administration and its focus on both cost cutting and a return to office policy for federal employees will have on the local job market. In the expansion markets, our long-term outlook remains positive as we expect to continue to see higher-than-average job growth in those metro areas. But our near-term operating environment is challenging. We have seen stability in new lease rates and occupancy in Atlanta and Dallas the last two months. And while volatility is possible, we currently expect that new lease rates will improve as they usually do in the busy -- spring leasing season in these markets. In Denver, conditions today are challenging as we have some new deals in close proximity to our assets that could push the improvement later in the year. Even with these hope for improvements in operating conditions, we expect same-store revenue in our expansion markets to be lower in 2025 than it was in 2024. Looking at the overall company level as we sit here today, we really like our position. We're looking forward to capturing the opportunities the spring leasing season brings, which will help frame pricing power for the full year. I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to our residents and focus on delivering these results. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob to walk through the rest of our guidance expectations for 2025. Robert Garechana : Thanks, Michael. With Michael having just walked through 2025 same-store revenue expectations, let me finish with same-store expenses, normalized FFO and provide some color on anticipated capital markets activity for 2025. Turning to expenses. Expense management remains a core strength of EQR as demonstrated over the years and during 2024. Our 2025 guidance of 3.5% to 4.5% implies somewhat higher growth in 2025 than 2024, as outlined on Page 6 of the management presentation, but still reflects that strength. As you can see, the incremental growth in expenses are stemming from a couple of items. First, connectivity expenses are adding approximately $5 million to expense growth as we deploy bulk WiFi in the portfolio. As Michael mentioned, they are also adding revenue, so we will be accretive to NOI for the full year. Second, we have another year of 421-a tax abatement step-ups in the New York portfolio. We're down to only a handful of properties and step-up with most nearing the end of the period. As we have mentioned in the past, once fully taxed, there is an incremental income opportunity as affordable units convert to market rate in the future. Beyond those two items, same-store expense growth will look relatively similar to 2024, but with a little incremental growth from utilities and payroll given the low growth in 2024, setting up a tough comparable period. Moving to NFFO. Page 8 provides some narrative around NFFO contributors outside of same store, along with a bridge to the midpoint of our guidance range. This bridge can also be found in the earnings release. Beyond residential same-store NOI, let me provide some color around a couple of the larger categories. First, transaction NOI. The majority of this contribution is coming from 2024 transaction activity and our buys themselves last year. There is some impact from our assumptions in 2025. But as Mark mentioned, this will be contingent upon what market conditions look like, so that could change. Second, interest expense. The majority of the increase in interest expense is coming from increases in anticipated balances from investment activity, mostly acquisitions, with about $0.01 of the increase also coming from refinancing of our 2025 maturity and what we expect to be a higher rate. More about that in a second. And finally, lease-up NOI. The $0.01 contribution from lease-up NOI is coming from our few consolidated lease-ups. The majority of our lease-ups are from unconsolidated joint ventures in our expansion markets that are encumbered with project-level debt and the net income from those projects runs through the income from investments in unconsolidated entities line. Four of these unconsolidated JV development deals were completed late in 2024 and will be leasing up throughout the year. Given current leasing velocity and the cessation of capitalized interest on loans, we do not expect these joint venture assets to contribute to NFFO growth in 2025. We've added specific guidance on this income to the guidance page of the earnings release. Finally, let me briefly mention our anticipated capital markets activity for 2025. We have won significant maturity, which is a $450 million, 3.375% note due in June of this year. We would expect to refinance this note at or near the maturity, most likely with unsecured debt. We have ample liquidity and capacity under our recently expanded commercial paper program to float this pay off and be opportunistic about when exactly we refinance the maturity. All other financing activities will be dependent upon transaction activity and conditions, as Mark mentioned. Our guidance assumes $500 million to $1 billion of debt issuance because we modeled being a net acquirer of $500 million in our guidance. Expected that issuance, however, will adjust as that adjusts. With that, let me turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Eric Wolfe with Citi. Eric Wolfe : Hey thanks. You mentioned that same-store revenue should accelerate throughout the year. Can you just talk about how much of that is driven by other income versus improved fundamentals? And then what type of acceleration you're expecting in the second half versus first half? Or where you expect to start the year versus the year however you think we should think about it? Robert Garechana : Yes. Hey Eric, it's Bob, but I'll start with that kind of outlining the shape of what we expect revenue to be. The shape should be such that as you mentioned that the acceleration of the year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter growth will be higher in the back end of the year than the front end of the year. And there's two main drivers associated with that. The first driver is really that we're starting the year with a lower embedded growth than historical, and a lot of the growth is coming from actual leasing activity in 2025. And so as you get to the second quarter and the third quarter, which are the prime leasing season, you start to see that contribution coming through the quarter-over-quarter. And so there's a good portion of growth associated in the back-end quarters. There relative to the front quarters, which will be lower because of that lower embedded growth. Additionally to that, you also have the other income, which has kind of got the same shape to it. So you have -- the other income is a lot of it, as Michael mentioned is connectivity, so you have that growth component also more weighted in the third and fourth quarter as you roll through the program of rolling out the WiFi piece. So from a kind of quarter-over-quarter perspective in same-store revenue, you should see the first quarter being the lowest and a little bit lower, and then it builds as you see the leasing activity and as you see the other income contribute overall such that you get to a higher Q4 relative to Q1. Eric Wolfe : Got it. That's helpful. And then you outlined some markets that you expect to improve throughout the year, I think many SS and Sunbelt, at least from like a blended rent perspective, maybe not from a same-store revenue for Sunbelt, but can you just talk about how much better the sort of second half blended rate growth might be versus the first half? I'm just trying to understand the sort of the degree of improvement you're expecting in those markets? Michael Manelis : Yes, Eric, this is Michael. So I mean I think you would follow a shape right now. We gave some guidance in the release for the first quarter as to how blends will play out, which is the 1.4% to 2.2%. And I'll tell you, in that equation, I mean, you've heard me talk before about the consistency in our renewal process. So renewals are pretty much flat going month by month throughout these quarters. So I think the build, as you see the year play out, you would clearly start to accelerate in the second half of the year, which the third quarter probably having the strongest but then you would expect moderation again in that fourth quarter. So the shape doesn't look materially different than other years. It's just -- it's going to be elevated as you work your way through the middle of the year. Eric Wolfe : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Yes, thanks. I know you're trying to get away from a ton of sort of KPIs on the leasing side kind of month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter. But could you just maybe provide some color on where our renewal rates are going out? I guess we were pleasantly surprised that, 5% renewal increase in the fourth quarter, but new leases did come in, I think, a touch weaker than we had expected. So maybe where are you sending out renewals today across the portfolio in the first quarter? Michael Manelis : Hey Steve, this is Michael. So first, I just want to remind you, we do have a centralized renewal team handling our entire renewal process, including all the negotiations which has really allowed us to execute like various strategies across the markets as we see conditions changing. Right now, we're in the process of tightening up negotiations as we start dealing with renewal months that are heading into that leasing season like Mark. We have conditions that are improving in Seattle, San Francisco, LA. We love the current occupancy position that the portfolios in. So for the next several months right now, the quotes that are out there in the marketplace are about to 7% and I'd say that we would expect to achieve increases somewhere right around that 5% kind of range. We've got good insights. We got a lot of confidence in the stability of this renewal performance in the portfolio right now. Steve Sakwa : Great, thanks. And then maybe on capital deployment. I know you've got net acquisition volume of $500 million, but you do have a moderately active development pipeline. I'm just curious, how does development sort of play into your thought process today where are yields on new projects? And how do those development yields kind of stack up to the acquisition yields you're looking at? Alex Brackenridge : Hey Steve, it's Alec. It's a pretty uncertain market right now, just to be able to even start and peg an acquisition cap rate. But for the moment, assume it's a round of 5, I can't tell you there are a lot of transactions right now because the market is pretty frozen. So you'd like to think you could build to around a 6. And I think that's the number most people are shooting for. And with rents where they are and costs not going down too much. There's been some lower costs. But overall, it's pretty hard to get to that 6 for a location you really like, unless it's really simple product. So we're seeing is more stuff being built further out further more suburban, even ex urban and not really the stuff we're crazy about. So we've been really patient. We have -- just 3 starts this year and nothing geared up yet for this -- sorry, sorry, 3 starts from last year and nothing geared up for this year. But we keep looking at if we can find the right location, which would be a place where we don't think we'll be able to buy -- and the 3 starts last year, as a reminder, we're in suburban Boston and suburban Seattle, that's what we would pursue. But right now, it's really tough to make the numbers work on something that's appealing to us. Steve Sakwa : Great. Thanks. Operator : We'll now take a question from John Pawlowski with Green Street. John Pawlowski : Hey good morning. I have a follow-up question on the -- your comments around supply likely being down 30% in 2026 relative to pre-pandemic -- pre-pandemic norms. I'm curious if you bifurcated that between urban and suburban. Is it fair to assume that Urban's down significantly more than that 30%. And then -- if so, how are you just thinking about your ideal market mix right now or submarket mix between urban and suburban given Urban might have a longer runway of no supply than the suburbs? Mark Parrell : Hey John, it's Mark Parrell. First off, go Eagles, right? Second, I'll say to you, we agree, I think, with your comment, I think that's perceptive. On the urban side, we see a lot less being built, the high-rise product you need to build to make those numbers work. Frankly, don't work at all of those numbers at this point. And we see a longer runway in some of the urban submarkets. And that's why we've talked a little bit about continuing to stay exposed in our legacy established markets to the urban core and in our new markets of having a presence in urban areas as well. There's deeper pools of demand in urban areas. It's typically been more, supply, but we think that dynamic is going to change. So we like being differentiated by continuing to think of the urban centers is worthy of investment. But every city varies and Alec can amplify that. There's places that are less appealing, like frankly, Dallas, Central City. And there's places like Midtown Atlanta that do have a lot of supply, but are much more appealing to our demographic. So, we're going to continue to balance that out. But we are investing in urban areas, both in our current coastal markets as well as these new kind of expansion markets that we've been focused on. Alex Brackenridge : Yes. To Mark's point, so we do distinguish between, say, the CBD, which sometimes people think is only the only urban area. With some neighborhoods that are closer still very dense but offer a great quality of life without some of the legacy issues that we're seeing in CBDs throughout the country. John Pawlowski : Okay. But I guess in terms of the capital allocation read-through relative to 6 months or 12 months ago, you guys being -- are you guys becoming more open-minded that your urban concentration should be higher than you expected it to be 6 months to 12 months ago moving forward? Mark Parrell : I'm not sure that's changed a great deal. I think it's just the balancing act. There are a few assets in urban centers on the West Coast that we probably will sell over time because, John, we're a little over concentrated in certain submarkets. But I mean, we talked about the benefits of urban concentration even when things were difficult during COVID. The opinion has changed. We like the exposure in the urban areas. We like it. Now I think you're going to see the benefit of it in our numbers in the next year or so -- so I think having that diversification not being all suburban or ex-urban or whatnot is a good thing for us. But there's going to be markets like Dallas, where as Alec said, we're kind of a little more distant urban and a lot more suburban. And then markets like New York where we're entirely urban. And I like having that toggle. I think markets have different best spots to invest in. And -- so yes, we feel good about our urban, but frankly, we feel good about it a year ago, too. John Pawlowski : Okay. My last question, Michael, just on the D.C. market. I know it's really early in the news flow changes by the hour. Just curious what your local team is seeing on the ground in terms of foot traffic, pricing power on existing tenants or new tenants just given the uncertainty about potential layoffs for federal employees? Michael Manelis : Yes. It's a great question, John. So I mean, right now, I got to tell you, the DC portfolio is occupied 97.1% today. We have a pricing curve that's on par to slightly better than what you would expect for the beginning of the year. In terms of like the feedback on on-site right now, we haven't really seen anything kind of flow through with renewals. I think everybody is still a little bit on edge. And I think as I said in my prepared remarks, there's still a lot of uncertainty on the overall impact, I guess, I would say, to demand in terms of layoffs versus this concept of bringing people back into the office, like does that neutralize each other in the demand. So I think it's still a little bit too early, but I can tell you I know there are people that are on angst right now in the market, and we just kind of need to see how this plays out over the course of the next couple of months. But the positioning of the market and the portfolio today is really strong. Mark Parrell : And the diversification of employers is a lot better in DC, John, it's Mark than it used to be. I mean there are other employers there. There's a lot, by the way, of defense industry-related stuff, which may not be subject to the same staffing restrictions. I know some of those people weren't sent the same e-mail that I guess was sent to the general federal workforce. So I think there are definitely ups and downs there. And probably a smaller federal workforce going forward. But in terms of the DC focused workforce, that number might end up being higher because of the defense concentration. And as Michael said, them just asking or demanding that people be in the office. Those people that are far away are not currently renters from us and maybe new renter soon for a portfolio that is very little slack in it already. John Pawlowski : Okay, thanks for your time. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Michael Goldsmith : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is on seasonality. It seems like in the second year in a row, maybe a weaker fourth quarter, but with expectations of a stronger first quarter. So can you talk a little bit about the factors that are influencing that? And then also within the comments that it seems like the momentum should be sustained through this year into the fourth quarter of 2025. So what gives you confidence that the momentum can be sustained through this year, which was kind of like the trends in the last 2 years? Thanks. Michael Manelis : Yes. Michael, this is Michael. So I think from a seasonality standpoint, I would tell you, the fourth quarter kind of played out the way we expected it to play out. I mean, you normally see deceleration. Clearly, we have some very seasonal markets like Boston is a great example of that, where you do see that deceleration occur. And then you turn the corner into January and you start your run into the spring with pricing and momentum building. So I think the shape of the curve for this year is not materially different, right? You're going to build up as you work your way through the spring and into kind of the fall and have stronger momentum and stronger kind of new lease change than what we experienced in 2024 because I just think the macro indicators for us tell us that we are in for a period of stronger pricing power this year than what we had last year, but that doesn't mean that we won't see deceleration in the fourth quarter of 2025. We would expect to see some deceleration at that time just based on normal seasonality trends in the way these markets act. But the strength in the portfolio right now gives us that confidence of having this pricing power build and some of the recovery in these West Coast markets clearly are going to put us in a position to start having stronger blended rates than what we've seen in the past. Michael Goldsmith : Got it. Helpful. Second question, on the 421-a the expense component is pretty clear, but how should we be thinking about the potential benefit to these buildings in terms of revenue as restrictions burn off? And if I can squeeze one more in as well. How much Sunbelt is entering the same-store pool this year? Thanks. Alex Brackenridge : Michael, it's Alec. Just on the 421-a question. It's really hard to project that because they don't turn to market until they vacate. So if someone stays in the unit a longer time, you obviously can't get to that unit sooner. They could -- they could move out tomorrow and we get to it right away. So it's hard to peg, but the upside is high because a lot of these rents are like, say, $1, $1.50 a foot and they could go up to $6, $7 a foot. So there's some pretty dramatic increases that are potentially possible. Robert Garechana : Hey Michael, and on the same-store component with the Sunbelt, the 2025 same-store set is not materially different than the 2024 same-store set. There's a couple of assets coming in to it from the Sunbelt. The majority of our transaction activity won't hit the full year annualized same-store set until 2026 because recall that, you might see it in Q3 and Q4 are the quarterly set because we bought the assets like from the Blackstone portfolio and did most of our transaction activity in the back half of 2024. But until you enter the full year same stores that it won't materially change until 2026. Mark Parrell : And just to add a little more color, Michael, a good question. In 2026, a lot of those units are going to be suburban. It just happens by coincidence as we built these balanced portfolios that we bought, for example, more in Denver in urban areas initially. Those properties are in same store. They did really, really well for us. And now they're getting hurt by the supply. So you see our numbers sort of suffer disproportionately. But the non-same-store pool, which is predominantly almost entirely suburban in those big three markets for us of Atlanta, Dallas and Denver. When that rolls in the same store in 2026, I think that's going to be very helpful. And I think it's going to prove out the benefit of having a balanced portfolio in kind of both parts of the market, not just all suburban, not just all urban, we will have gotten benefit through the whole cycle. Michael Goldsmith : Well thank you very much. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Anthony Paolone : Yes, thanks. I would like to shift over first to acquisition market. Can you maybe give us a sense as to where private market is right now in terms of IRRs, where thinking is for NOI growth the next few years and just how you're seeing liquidity out there? Alex Brackenridge : Hi, it's Alec. There is a lot of interest in the multifamily sector. I was at NMHC and Las Vegas and everyone is eager to buy. But -- the market is really frozen right now. So people would like to buy it around 5%. I think they probably project that to be a 7.5-ish IRR on their numbers. But the 4.5, 10-year, I'm not sure that they're ready to pull the trigger plus all the other uncertainty in the world. So right now, the markets get a bit of standstill. But with all this capital out there, plus a lot of these deals that aren't capitalized for the long run, and we're getting the sense that lenders are more likely to pull the plug on those and stop extending them, but there will be more supply available. And hopefully, in a quarter or two, I'll be able to give you a more fulsome answer would have some examples because we expect that to happen, the market to pick up. But as it stands today, it's really theoretical because there's very, very little activity. Anthony Paolone : Okay, thanks. And then just a question for Bob. You talked about the drag in JV FFO from the development stabilizing there. Can you give us some sense as to what the difference in FFO is likely to be when those projects stabilize versus what's in your 2025 guidance? Robert Garechana : Yes. Let me talk about kind of how to think about that as opposed to necessarily giving a specific 2026 year-over-year. So there's two drivers, right? There's the \u201cdrag\u201d from just the lease-up process. Number one, is just the NOI, right? So when you're leasing up -- and you typically incur the operating expenses before you get the revenue as you build occupancy that I think we're familiar with. So by the end of this year, from an NOI perspective, these assets will be accretive, right? Like they will have turned to be NOI positive. They will start -- they will continue to be the ramp up, you'll be over that component. They may not be FFO accretive because they have construction loans on them, and those construction loans are at 6.5% rate, they won't have gotten to the yield as we there yet, right? And so that's where you're seeing that cessation of the cap interest and the NOI kind of to cash flow streams line up. When you think about getting to 2026, there's two things to keep in mind. Number one, you'll have the positive that they will have stabilized, and you'll have probably all four quarters being stabilized or close to stabilized from the NOI standpoint. Number two, we're also at the buy-sell component. So we'll likely be able to exercise with our JV partners a recap of the ventures. And put what I would say, better debt on or no debt on or the acquirer in that process, and therefore, they will be much more accretive than what they were this year. Anthony Paolone : Okay, thank you. Operator : We'll now take our question from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. James Feldman : Great, thank you. I just want to start with the same-store revenue build. So the -- can you talk more about the nonresidential piece to the guidance? What's in there? And then, I guess, just bigger picture, what do you think -- I guess, for Bob, what do you think moves your guidance the most? I think you came out 2% below the midpoint of -- the Street, where is the most upside or downside or easiest upside or downside to your numbers on FFO? Robert Garechana : Yes. So let me start on the non-residential piece. So just to remind everyone, non-residential is about 4% of the aggregate kind of portfolio from a revenue standpoint. So it's not a huge component of the business, and it mostly consists of half of it is, I'd call it, third-party parking and the other half of it is street-level retail. That acts as an amenity to the space. The 20 basis points drag, some of you may recall that in the first quarter of 2024, under the accounting rules, we recognize because the tenants became more collectible and we'd previously written off the straight-line leases, we actually reinstated the straight line on a number of those assets. And therefore, we got a $4.5 millionish kind of pick up overall to revenue. That was a onetime item that happened in Q4 that's not going to happen -- or Q1 of 2024, that's not going to happen again. And so that's that drag overall as it relates to the nonresidential piece. Otherwise, the business is largely performing the way you would expect those two lines of business to perform. As it relates to guidance, we give you a guidance range because there are a variable series of outcomes that could occur. Obviously, within the same-store portfolio, depending on how the leasing is because we're so dependent on the leasing season this year. And our outlook looks like the leasing season. Michael mentioned some of the items that could put you on the higher end of the guidance range from same-store. It's Seattle, San Francisco performed better. If you get a bigger pickup, that could move same-store. And same-store is the largest driver to NFFO in the aggregate by far. It is the core business that makes up the vast majority of that. All the other items I would tell you are largely noise. We could do a little better in refinancing. We could do a little bit better in overhead, but those are just marginal components. It really is the growth engine of the business really is the core portfolio. James Feldman : Okay, thank you for that. And then I mean, the headlines have been fast and furious since the inauguration. So I guess just to get inside your boardroom and your C-suite, I mean what is your team talking about the most in terms of -- what's good -- what could be good for the business, what could be bad for the business over the next four years or maybe two years? And then if you could get more granular on by market, that would be interesting, too. Mark Parrell : It's Mark. I'm going to start and maybe others or will contribute to that. I mean the new administration is in its very early innings. There's certainly been a lot going on, but we're only a few weeks into it. The Congress has only been convened for, little longer than that. So it's a little bit hard to tell. I want to make a comment, though, about how we think about it because there's a little bit of a bifurcation here. We've been through these periods of heightened uncertainty. We have no idea. I'm not sure anyone knows for sure what all these actions are going to do to economic growth, what they're going to do to housing demand, I mean all that remains to be seen. But we need to focus on our dashboard. So we say it internally, focus on your dashboards, not on the headlines. Michael and his team's dashboards across our 300 properties are busy watching micro demand trends, and they feel good. Those dashboards buy and large are green. That's the optimism you hear your management team reflect, and we're going to run the business based on what we see there. On the capital allocation side, for me, Alec, the rest of us in the Board on the refinancing side for Bob, I mean, I think this kind of situation speak some caution. I certainly think there's a fair bit of uncertainty. Uncertainty can mean opportunity when you're one of the best capitalized guys in the space like we are. So I would say I'm not sure market-by-market is that helpful. But I would say as it relates to the federal government and whatever it ends up doing, we're prepared for that, we think, as much as we can be. We are not directly impacted by things like tariffs because we aren't predominantly housing people in the manufacturing area or the foreign trade area. We are part of the bigger economy for sure. But I'll also make a comment, which I kind of alluded to in my remarks, it's pretty good to be in a business with -- that's fundamental that has no foreign operations. That has got strong cash flow and a good dividend in a time of uncertainty. My guess is companies like ours will be better valued by the Street in the next sort of uncertain period of time than maybe more speculative firms have of late. So again, we're looking at all those things and like you, we'll see what happens. As for local government, I mean the big win in California was great. And, we think we did a great job there, as I said in our remarks and making the case to the people. These other states are really important regulatory-wise, places like the state of Washington will be focus points. But policy wise, I think it's the federal show, and we'll see what kind of comes next. James Feldman : Thank you. Operator : We'll now move to our next caller, who is Julien Blouin with Goldman Sachs. Julien Blouin : Hi, thank you. Just wondering, in LA, how you're thinking about the profitability of those rent freezes and eviction moratorium proposals passing. I don't know if there's sort of stuff you're hearing from your teams on the ground that can maybe sort of give us an indication? Mark Parrell : Yes. Thanks for your question. I appreciate that. You got to start off whenever you talk about LA fires, by the huge level of empathy we have for our colleagues in that market for our residents, for the whole community. I mean they've been through a lot, and it's been a real tough process. We think we've been really supportive and responsible corporate community participant. We've been supporting charities in that market that are working on relief efforts. We've been supporting our residents and our employees, including being really thoughtful about rent even before the governor put his anti-gouging order, which by the way covers goods and services, not just rent into place. So we think we've been very thoughtful about those sort of things. We think these ideas, one of which is a sort of a pretty broad eviction moratorium that's being considered are just terrible ideas. This market continues to recover from the 3-year plus COVID eviction moratorium, which was broad-based and not well policed and really caused a lot of disruption. And even worse for L.A., which desperately need a ton of housing investment to rebuild and needs it to just house the people even before the fires didn't have enough housing for. This is really discouraging. This is the consideration of these sort of anti-housing measures like eviction moratoriums again, further the reputation LA has a being anti-business and anti-housing, and it pushes capital away. So that's the argument we're making with our local associations. Like I said, I think there's more effective ways to do this. There's a lot of relief money the federal government and state have, I understand if there's folks that need help specifically on rent, I'm sure that mechanics can be created to be helpful there, but some sort of broad-based sort of rule in an area that large just makes very little sense to us. And same goes for any rent control besides what the governor put out there on the anti-gouging side. It's just, again, we and others have been pretty responsible. If you want to encourage housing production you have to send the right price signals. And I think more and more regulation is not the signal. We're so encouraged about Seattle and San Francisco. They're doing so much better being pro-business and pro housing. And we just hope L.A. comes along. That market is still not there on the government side, and we're going to continue to advocate for it to turn. Julien Blouin : Thank you. That's really helpful. And I guess as a second one, sorry if I missed it, but did you provide January new lease rate growth and blends -- or is there sort of -- can you give us a sense of where they landed relative to the 1.4% to 2.2% range for the first quarter blends? Michael Manelis : Hey Julien, it's Michael. So I think I've explained this in the past that these metrics are best used like over a longer period of time versus the stand-alone months, especially given the small quantity. So you didn't miss it because I haven't said it. What I will tell you is that we are seeing sequential improvement, which is what you would expect in the month of January. And based on this full year expectation, 2% to 3% blended rate growth. We anticipate the first quarter is going to come in between the 1.4% and 2.2% that we included in the press release. As I mentioned last quarter, these stats have a lot of variability in them. And the quantity of transactions in either new lease or renewals can impact the reported blended rates in any given quarter or even a month. So we always have these various puts and takes in our revenue model and the new lease change is only one of these variables in the equation that happens to be very dependent upon who moves out which is why you've seen a shift towards providing ranges of blended rate results by quarter. And I guess I would just stop by the fourth quarter came in exactly where we thought it would be. And I think right now, when we're looking at the dashboards and seeing what we think, we have a lot of confidence in that first quarter range that we put out there. Julien Blouin : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator : We'll now move on to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Thank you. That's LA. I know you want to be conservative and there's -- maybe it's too early to come out with any guidance impact. But you did mention that you expect occupancy or demand to increase for your larger units. And I was wondering how much of that you've already seen in January, if you could provide possibly an occupancy number for LA and Orange County in January? Michael Manelis : Hey John, this is Michael. So I guess I want to say too in the fourth quarter, right, we actually felt better. Like you heard me say that even on the last call, that we started to see this improvement. We started to see the improvement in demand that allowed us to backfill. So the occupancy for the fourth quarter, I think ticked up to like $95.8 million. We originally modeled this market to have additional improvement both with some rate recovery and additional occupancy gains. And in the month of January right now, I would say we're seeing some of that incremental improvement specific to the fires and specific to my comment I had in the prepared remarks, 45% of our portfolio is 2 and 3 bedrooms. We initially saw kind of that spike in demand for that type of unit really hyper focused in 3 submarkets : Ventura County, Glendale, Pasadena and West LA and both Venture and Glendale are very small. We only have a few assets in those submarkets. So, we did see some of this incremental demand, but it's not like you see this kind of widespread kind of increase coming across the entire broader market. So I think I just want to stand back and just say, our base case still kind of holds. We do believe this market is ripe for improvement. We saw some of that happening in the fourth quarter. I think there will be some incremental play with the occupancy in the market. But I'm not sure at this point, we have enough confidence to say that it's like a significant shift to the underlying base case that we put out there. John Kim : Yes, I'm just curious on the timing. I would have thought that the spike, if there were any, would have already occurred and people are displaced. But is it because people will have the place and went to taper housing or? Michael Manelis : Yes. I mean I think part of this is a geography, like where do they get displaced? Are these families that have children that were in schools that need to stay close. So I think a lot of this is the geography, which is if you think about the three submarkets I laid out, we're not surprised that we saw that initial demand. And there's no doubt. In those three submarkets, we clearly saw an increase in demand for 2 and 3 bedrooms over the course of two weeks to three weeks following these fires. So I just -- right now, we're still trying to see how does all of this stuff settle out? And where do people really kind of want to live longer term. And that's kind of what we're focused on this broader demand in the market. John Kim : Okay. My second question is on your blended lease growth guidance of 2.5%. If you could break that out between new and renewal, it would seem to imply if you have renewals of 5% that new would be flattish. And I'm wondering, just given the market runs about why new lease growth couldn't be higher? Michael Manelis : I think it's really just -- I mean, so you're not off with kind of that underlying assumption that's one way to get to that blended rate growth of 2.5%. And I think what you see is it's very common. Again, we have these data points going all the way back to 2006, we understand how these market seasonality components play into both new lease renewals and pricing trend. It is not uncommon for us to see negative new lease in the fourth quarter, negative new lease in the first quarter even that then put some of that downward pressure into that blended. So you're right that at the end of the year, you may walk away and have a new lease rate kind of growth that effective at 0. But I think some of these markets are also positioned right now where you could see an additional pullback in concessions. So maybe some of that net effective ticks up a little bit. But we're not saying that we're not going to see normal seasonal trends play out. Mark Parrell : There was a prior question about where the opportunity lies in our numbers, and I think you've done a good job of saying where it is. I mean it's new lease growth. It won't totally defy seasonality. But if we're reporting better numbers on new lease through the year, even if the fourth quarter is negative, but the second and third are more positive than we think, that's going to be the way early enough in the year where the numbers will move around to the good. John Kim : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Haendel Juste with Mizuho. Haendel St. Juste: Hey guys, good afternoon. I was hoping to get a bit more color on some of those blended rent expectations by region. And maybe, I guess, most of us assume that East Coast blend should be better than West Coast and Sunbelt will lag, but I was hoping you get a bit more color on perhaps the range or a sense of the expectation for blends by region? Thanks. Michael Manelis : Yes. Haendel, it's Michael. So I mean I think what you should think about is the West Coast recovery is going to drive improving blends in the West Coast markets, all of the West Coast markets, even including the Southern California portfolio. I think we're going to continue to see strength in the East Coast markets, so maybe similar kind of blend than what you saw this year. And then in the expansion markets, you kind of see a little bit of this stability right now for us in Atlanta and Dallas. And my hope is that as we kind of work our way towards the spring season, you start to see either rates improving or concessions falling back that then show you not only stability and blends, but a little bit of this path to recovery of blends that sets you upgrade for 2026. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. That's helpful. And on the subject of concessions, can you talk a little bit about where concessions are today in your San Fran and Seattle portfolios and where we -- or maybe where you'd expect them to trend over the next couple of quarters and how much of a tailwind that could be into the back half of the year? Michael Manelis : Yes. So I mean I think on the concession use overall, right? The fourth quarter came in exactly kind of where we thought it would be. We lean into this occupancy during the slower periods of time. We saw significant reductions in San Francisco while holding a solid occupancy of 96%. And then Seattle saw a 100 basis point improvement in occupancy but we had similar concessions there to the fourth quarter of 2023. So I think as you think about concessions in the marketplace right now, specifically in those two markets, it's still kind of elevated. San Francisco is still a concessionary market especially that downtown. But I think what we're looking at right now is total revenue because if you have the demand and have the occupancy, you could see base rents start picking up in those markets, which is what we've kind of been doing even though the concessions kind of stay neutral. Our expectations as we work through this year is that the concession use will start to kind of moderate. We did model for fewer concessions in 2025 than we used in 2024. And I think we see some of the strength right now and the positioning of the portfolio that gives us confidence that, that could play out. Haendel St. Juste: That's helpful. And if I could just ask about the same-store expense guide. You put out the range out there. I appreciate that, but any details perhaps on the buildup for items, including taxes, insurance, R&M. So maybe some color on the components? Thanks. Rob Garechana : Yes. Haendel, it's Bob. Page 6 gives you a little bit of the contribution to growth overall. But -- so ex kind of the two called out items, which are the connectivity expense and the real estate tax expense, I think the two biggest call-outs and I mentioned them in terms of like growth that is dissimilar or maybe greater than what you saw in 2024, would be utilities. Utilities is one of them that you're just seeing higher commodity prices, continued pressure in -- and we also, frankly, had a really good year in 2024. So utilities is probably growing in the more mid to mid-single digits than kind of lower single digits. So that will contribute to growth more in 2025 than it did in 2024. Same thing with repairs and maintenance. Repairs and maintenance, the headline number will look really big because the connectivity expense is mostly in that line item or is in that line item. But outside of that, you just have some wage pressure and some typical stuff. And then payroll we model to be more like a typical 3% range. And we've had phenomenal payroll experience over multiple years, but last year, 2024 in particular, where it was flat. So -- those are probably the main category items. I know people are typically interested in insurance because insurance, although a small category has been growing really fast. We did model that. We expect it to be, call it, high single digits as opposed to low double digits. So some improvement in that market, we don't renew until March. Mark Parrell : And I'm just going to add some color on insurance here for a minute because we have a unique perspective to share. Our risk management team just happened to be in London meeting with our reinsurers and some of our insurance carriers just after the worst of the fires in LA. And so we had the opportunity to ask them how the market felt to them and what might happen with commercial renewals. And their response was they didn't expect much of an impact and that they had capacity and they had had good financial results lately. And so we are feeling optimistic about where we may end up, including thinking you could get close to flat on this renewal or somewhere in that range. And I say all that because the fires appear not to have reached reinsurers at their level and their experiences lately post some of the earth, the big increases after the hurricanes is that they've built up reserves and there is more capacity in the insurance market. So again, we're feeling optimistic about that renewal. As Bob said, that occurs for property for us in March. But some early indications from our reinsurers and some of our primary insurers are they're in pretty good position that the fires in Los Angeles were terrible, but probably won't affect that part of the insurance market and us very much. Haendel St. Juste: Great. Operator : Will now take our question from Brad Heffern with RBC. Brad Heffern : Hey thanks everybody. One thing that hasn't come up in the political discussion so far as immigration obviously, just as many unknowns there as in the other things. But how much of an impact do you think that could potentially have on the business? And how would you view it differently between the expansion markets and the legacy portfolio? Michael Manelis : So, Brad, this is Michael. Maybe I'll start and somebody else can weigh in. So I think from the operations standpoint, there's actually two areas to think about when we look at what's going on with immigration. First is on the resident side of the business, right, in terms of are you seeing kind of less demand from people coming in from foreign countries? Or are you seeing lease breaks or people leaving you due to kind of deportation or immigration risk. And honestly, right now, we haven't seen any of that. I mean the absolute count of transactions for us with foreign activity is really low in the fourth quarter, but both from the move in and the move-outs, they're trending in line with our historical norms. The other part of the business that we're watching really closely relates to this contract service providers and whether or not they're going to be put in a position where they're not going to be able to provide services to us or try to increase rates. So right now, we have not heard anything of any issues impacting our vendors and their ability to continue to provide services to us. So from the operations standpoint, it still feels like it's just too early to tell what impact that this could have. And I think when we look at all of this, even inside of our vendor pool and inside of our resident base, these are just such small percentages of the total population that we deal with, whether that's the vendor population or within our renter base. In the renter side of the world, foreign move-ins are like 2% to 3% of our move-ins. So it's just not a significant kind of quantity for us to be overly concerned about. Brad Heffern : Okay. Got it. And then on the West Coast tech markets, can you just give your base case for market rent growth in those markets for 2025? And then you've talked about the potential for outperformance? Any sort of scale as to what that outperformance could look like would be great as well. Michael Manelis : Yes. Well, I think I said in my prepared remarks, Seattle is projected right now to be the strongest revenue growth, which is makes me very proud to say that because it's nothing we've been able to save for many years now, but that is projected to have revenue growth, call it, around for the year, which would be some of the best revenue would be the highest revenue growth that we have in the portfolio. San Francisco is a little bit less on that, so it's probably more like in the mid-3% range. But again, that's a pretty solid number coming off of a 1.5% growth that we saw in 2024. So in terms of like the outperformance, it really comes down to the strength that Mark just mentioned a little bit earlier. When do we see this pricing power strength? How early in the leasing season. How many leases can we capture at that to have it translate into revenue growth for 2025. So there's two plays. The biggest drivers are occupancy and rate. And if you're going to get the rate, it's got to be early in the year were it to really make a big difference in the full year revenue guidance. Brad Heffern : Okay, appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : We'll now move to Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Jeffrey Spector : Great, thank you. Can you elaborate on your comment that you expect record retention to stay record low turnover in 2025? Michael Manelis : Yes. This is Michael, Jeff. So thanks for that. We have actually seen this now for two years in a row. And I think part of this is the housing equation or the move-outs to buy home or at record lows. We don't really see anything kind of in the immediate future to suggest that, that's going to be materially different for us in 2025 even if you saw like mortgage rates contract a lot, that would probably mean that values and houses go up. So we don't really see this being like a light switch impact that's going to change. We also see this improvement in office using job growth. So therefore, on the demand side of the equation, we're not overly concerned about seeing lease breaks from people losing their jobs. So all of the macro drivers in this reported turnover number, the reasons for move-out, we just don't see anything telling us to expect any significant changes this year. And we're really focused we get so many data points -- it's like 200,000 data points from our customers every year. We're hyper focused on making sure we are delivering a seamless, exceptional customer experience to our residents. And I think that's showing up in these turnover numbers. Jeffrey Spector : Great, thank you. And then one follow-up on the urban conversation. Are you looking into any of the office to resi conversions as an opportunity for your company? Alex Brackenridge : Jeff, it's Alex. We've got a lot of experience owning buildings that have been converted from office to residential. And also seen how other people have gone through that process, and it's a tough process. But we wouldn't say no for sure. We look at any opportunity. But -- generally speaking, they take longer, cost more and come out with a less attractive projects than people think they will. So we go and completely eyes wide open. I don't think it's going to be a huge part of our development pipeline. And I also think it's going to be hard in a lot of cases to have it be a meaningful contributor to supply. Even in New York, where they got a specific tax abatement program geared towards these conversions it's really hard to make the numbers work. And maybe there'll be a number of 2,000, 3,000 over time that gets developed and maybe that normalizes to that kind of to 2,000 units a year over time. But in a big city like Manhattan, that's just not going to materially impact us. And most of the locations aren't competitive with us. They're either all the way downtown where we only have one asset or they're in parts of Midtown that just aren't competitive residential locations. Jeffrey Spector : Great, thank you. Maybe if I could sneak in just one more. Can you provide a quick preview on what you plan to discuss at the Investor Day? Thank you. Mark Parrell : Jeff, it's Mark. Well, I don't want to ruin it. I think we'll ruin it. I think the focus is going to be on the strategy, both on the capital allocation and operations side. It also, frankly, gives us an opportunity to show off a broader array of folks that are on the team. We've got an exceptional team here at equity. So you'll have to wait and see, but we're really looking forward to talking to everyone in a few weeks. Jeffrey Spector : Great. Thank you. Operator : We will now move to Rich Hightower with Barclays. Richard Hightower : Good afternoon, guys. I want to go back -- I apologize. I want to go back to get a clarifying response. I think Steve asked the question about renewals and asking rents kind of for the springtime. I think you said asking 7% should achieve 5%, but did that apply just to San Francisco, Seattle and L.A. Or was that for the whole portfolio? Michael Manelis : Rich, it's Michael. No, that's the whole portfolio. Richard Hightower : That's the whole portfolio. Okay. Great. And then, I guess, my real question, I didn't want to waste one on that. But I think as you think about the progression of improvement in the Sunbelt, specifically in your expansion markets over the course of the year, curious if you want to take a wager on when new lease growth inflect positive in those markets generally at what point in the year, if it does? Mark Parrell : All right. Well, I think that depends. It's Mark, as well on the lease that's being replaced. I guess I'm not willing to hazard that on any specific and every market is different. I mean we feel better about some parts of our portfolio in the three markets we're really in the two big Sunbelt markets of Atlanta and Dallas and Denver. So I don't really have an estimate. And by the way, it could go positive in the third quarter and go negative again and likely wood in the fourth. So I think the second derivative, I know is really important to the Street, but it's just going to be uneven. It's going to get a little better and then it's going to get worse. And if you have interruptions in job growth, it will be really problematic. So I don't think this team is willing to put real money on that bet. But I think we'll all feel a little better about all the Sunbelt markets, particularly ours in the second and third quarter. I think you're going to see good demand. You have a lot of supply, a lot of that supply happens to be front-end loaded, but that's okay because there's a lot of demand in the middle of the year. So I think there'll be some better sentiment. I just don't think it's going to translate into better cash flow growth for quite some time as we've talked on prior calls about how long it takes to redo the whole rent roll and take those numbers up, and that's why it's more of a 2026. And even for some markets in like a 2027 outcome in terms of having better same-store revenue growth. Richard Hightower : Okay, very helpful. Thank you Mark. Operator : We'll now move to Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : Hi, good morning guys. I think you guys are still an hour behind. So two questions. First, Mark, just big picture. Obviously, change in the administration, their policy on business regulation versus the prior you had that late FTC fee income just days before the inauguration, there's the continuing federal on real page. From a federal level, do you guys have any sense update on any shift in how DOJ or FTC is looking at these? Is it still continuing on? Or is there a sense that they may be more constructive and amenable on these? Any update? Mark Parrell : Yes. Thanks, Alex. I'll start by saying we're not in that gray star case. That's the FTC fee case that came out, like you said, a couple of weeks ago just before the change in administration. So don't really know anything about that case besides what's in the paper. I certainly think the focus that the administration has said about supply and maybe making federal land available. I'm not sure if that's desirable that land is to where people want to live, but -- those supply solutions Alex are much -- from our point of view, much more effective than some of the other regulatory efforts. But they just haven't done much, and they obviously have a lot of things going on. And I'm not sure we're top of their list. I will put one thing on your radar to consider there has been some conversation at the federal level about returning the GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to more private ownership. From their current mostly federal control. I don't know how that would happen exactly. There's a lot of complexity to that. But I think there is some push. I think that's worth watching at the federal level. To be honest, I think most of the regulatory issues and the opportunities we have are at the local level. And at the state level. But the Feds and their control of the real estate finance world through the GSEs is a pretty material thing. And we got to all keep track of that and see how that unfolds. Alexander Goldfarb : And then, Mark, that's a perfect segue to my second question. You guys were just at NMHC. And as the market -- the transaction market continues to fall, are you seeing any pricing differences setting out Sunbelt versus coastal meeting as people understand the regulatory changes and some of these recent local regulatory litigation efforts. Is there pricing differences that you're now seeing markets trading 50 bps wide or 70 bps wide or anything that's discernible that prices in some of these different risks that you guys have been articulating and others in the industry as well? Or is pricing pretty tight regardless and it's not really factoring in some of the issues that are out there. Alex Brackenridge : Hey Alex, it's Alec. There's such broad interest in multifamily housing that different investors are different interested in different parts of the country for different reasons. And you certainly see even in a place like Austin, it's got all the supply, there's still people who are interested in paying what I think are very, very aggressive cap rates. That will be great. But you also see it in the coastal markets, a return to interest in places like San Francisco, which in the last couple of years, we just hadn't heard many people that wanted to buy there and now we hear a lot. So the whole market is benefiting from multifamily being a favorite asset class. Mark Parrell : Yes. I'd say it's more like just what markets are open for business, Alex. And as Alec said a moment ago, we think San Francisco by that we're specifically talking about downtown and the more urbanized area of the Peninsula, we think is open business and there'll be transactions there. We think there'll be larger scale transactions in downtown Central Seattle. I would call out Los Angeles is still a market that probably doesn't have that especially central downtown Los Angeles that developed a level of interest institutionally. But again, we're hopeful some of this regulatory stuff. So as the Mayor in San Francisco energetic guy is out there doing this thing and Seattle does some constructive stuff. We vetted those markets will continue to improve. And will support better cap rates and more investor interest over time. They have probably more growth in them. So my guess is they should, at some point, have lower cap rates, and our model for that is New York. I mean just New York was kind of given up for dead, then it came all the way back. And I think we have record low cap rates in New York relative to anywhere else if we were willing to sell any of our good Manhattan assets there. So we got to see that play through the year, but that's our general sense. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you Mark. Operator : We'll now move to Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Adam Kramer : Hi guys. I'll keep it quick here with just one. I just wanted to ask about the comments, I think, pretty early in the call around office using job growth. I think you're expecting to be higher in 2025. I know you kind of mentioned the West Coast being a driver there. But just wondering if you could add any more detail. I think that may have come in a little bit of a surprise, maybe at least to me. So maybe just kind of what's driving that expectation from an office using job growth perspective? And I guess in the other markets like New York, Boston, D.C., what are the expectations there? Mark Parrell : Yes. So it's Mark. I'm going to start and maybe my colleagues will jump in here. So we generally use Moody's Analytics, we look at it. And again, we also, again, look at our dashboards and see where our people feel. And there was some terrific tech hiring maybe over hiring during the pandemic. And then you saw that kind of turn negative because a lot of those employment clusters of higher wage jobs are related to the information services sector or professional and business services. But when we talk to the economists, we tell our people on the grid, it feels better to us. It feels like there will be good job growth. And we just look at the job boards in those markets. So that's what we're basing that assumption on in San Francisco and Seattle and elsewhere on the job side. I will point out in the December government numbers you saw an improvement in professional and business services, you hadn't seen in a while. You saw information sector to a positive when it had been negative for a while. So you started to see in the numbers nationally some improvement in those office using jobs in late in 2024, and we hope that kind of powers through 2025. And certainly San Francisco and Seattle, I think, would be beneficiaries of that from what we're thinking. Operator : We'll now move to Alex Kim with Zelman & Associates. Alex Kim : Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. I hope that the team had a productive trip up to NMHC last week and great to see and hear the optimism surrounding the multifamily industry. There was some commentary at the conference about recently built assets, especially as sold by now based on traditional merchant build time lines since that could be unlocked in 2025. I was wondering if there could be any upside to your target $1.5 billion in acquisition volume this year? Alex Brackenridge : Alex, it's Alec. Yes, we certainly want to be optimistic and hope so. And I think we're really, really well positioned to move quickly. As we showed last year, the year started out slowly, but we did $1.5 billion in the third quarter alone. So we have machine here that can ramp up very quickly. And we've showed that we will do what we say we're going to do and perform in a way that many others, frankly, can't because they don't have the same access to capital that we do. So we're excited to see those opportunities, and I did allude to that earlier. I think it is true what you heard that these recently built assets were not financed for the long run, and we're excited to see them come to the market. Alex Kim : Great, thanks. And I know the call is going on, and I appreciate you all stick around. The strategy so far has been rating into newer vintage properties in your expansion markets, are there any additional markets that you're looking into at the moment? Mark Parrell : Our focus is really on the three, Atlanta, Dallas and Denver. There are other markets we'd consider that we've mentioned on occasion and we've talked to our Board about that share those same kind of attributes. But right now, the primary focus of those three markets. Austin is on the list, we have three properties there. It's just the supply picture was really tough. And there may be a year or so of delay before we kind of reengage in that market. But no, there isn't another market for us to announce on this call. Alex Kim : Got it. Thanks for the color. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Linda Tsai : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one. In terms of your favorable view towards Seattle and D.C., the 4% revenue expectation, how does the embedded growth for these two markets compare to the 80 bps for your overall portfolio? Robert Garechana : Linda, it's Bob. I'll start and maybe Michael can add. Directionally, the embedded in D.C. is actually really strong. So you had a really strong leasing performance, and you can see that from funded rate. So it's probably a little bit higher than the 80 basis points. Seattle is probably more like the average or slightly below the average because we had kind of that recovery experience in 2024. Rule of thumb I always think about is kind of taking your blends. This math doesn't perfectly work but taking your blends from the prior year, dividing them by 2, and that's kind of roughly your embedded. So that can give you a directional sense. But I'd say, directionally, starting with a really solid embedded, that's the driver of growth in DC. The Seattle story is more starting with an okay embedded, but it's really more of the leasing activity in the current year and the occupancy gain that's going to drive the revenue growth. Linda Tsai : Could you expand that to New York and San Fran to? Robert Garechana : New York probably looks more similar to DC, where you had the really strong leasing season and San Francisco probably looks more similar to Seattle. They probably align -- they happen to be on the same cost, but they also fundamentally probably more aligned with what I talked about relatively. Linda Tsai : Thank you. Operator : Will now take a question from Tayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank. Tayo Okusanya : Yes. Good afternoon. Just a quick one for me. In regards to the 2025 transaction assumption on the transaction dilution of negative 25 basis points Wondering if you could talk a little bit to that, just around the comfort of doing dilutive deals, at least in the first year? And how we should kind of think about the deals ultimately breaking even and actually adding shareholder value over time? Mark Parrell : I'm going to add a comment on Alec, may add. So one of the things to think about here is we're trying to give you numbers for the model. And NFFO is obviously before CapEx. A lot of these deals that we're selling are -- as Alec has commented many times considerably older and have a lot more CapEx, especially in the near term that we don't believe in, we'll get the return we need. So on an AFFO basis or on any sort of adjusted IRR basis, you're doing better by selling these assets. That's how we pick them. In terms of where those lines cross, it could be a year or two, but I would say on a cash flow basis, you may be advantaged immediately by selling an asset that really needs a renovation or a lot of common area work that we frankly don't believe in. Alex Brackenridge : Yes. Just to give you an example, last year, the average property that we bought was 5 years old and what we sold was 35 years old. Tayo Okusanya : Thank you. Operator : Next question will come from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Daniel Tricarico : It's Daniel Tricarico, apologies if I missed this. I know we've already talked about LA, but curious if you could share the same-store revenue growth expectation for your LA portfolio this year would be useful for us to know what's in there given the moving pieces? Michael Manelis : Hey Daniel, it's Michael. Yes, I had that, I think in the prepared remarks that we expect LA right now in our base case to deliver right around a 3% revenue growth. And that's based on some momentum and trajectory we saw in the fourth quarter and continuing some marginal improvement to play out through 2025, but nothing kind of like an outsized recovery in that market. Daniel Tricarico : Great. Thanks, that\u2019s all from me. Operator : And we'll now take our next question from Rich Anderson with Wedbush. Richard Anderson : Thanks. About four hours ago, Mark, you said your targets for expansion -- your target for expansion markets is 20%. I remember the number, 25%. I just want to -- I don't know if you're just short handing it there or are you walking back your ultimate landing point for expansion markets? Mark Parrell : Rich, thanks for sticking in there for the call. Yes. No, it's 20% to 25%. That's what we talk to our Board about by was just short handing it I think as you get to 20%, you may see us be maybe a bit less purposeful in hitting those numbers in a bit more open to doing buys in other places, like, for example, our coastal existing markets. So 20% isn't magic, 25% isn't either, but we'd expect to land in that range. So there is no change in approach, but we could end up either place. Richard Anderson : Fair enough. And so to my next quick question and like in August, you did a $1 billion deal with Blackstone added 2 percentage points to your exposure. This year is $2.5 billion, meaning you do every acquisition is an expansion market and every dispositions in coastal, do you get 500 basis points upside? And do you think that by this time next year, we'll be saying, well, you're at around 15%. Is that the cadence you guys are thinking about for the expansion markets? I think we all just want to get this kind of behind us and -- but also not rush it, of course. I'm just curious if you can sort of provide some timing ideas around finishing the job. Mark Parrell : Yes. I think you definitely restated exactly how management feels. We like to get this done as quickly as possible, provided there's good value to the shareholders, and it's not dilutive. So I'd tell you that your numbers are about right. About every $350 million to $400 million is a 1 percentage point you move it all out of one and into the other thing you got to think about is the denominator. So if we do grow the company and by debt issuance, which is what we put in there, I guess, we could issue equity, but that's not being contemplated now given the share price. Then you're in a position where you're going to accelerate that move a little bit. But I think your give or take 15% if you do everything the way you said, and that's what we hope. So to be done in a couple of years would be fabulous. Richard Anderson : Awesome. Okay, thanks very much. Mark Parrell : Thank you. Operator : And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to our presenters for any additional or closing comments. Mark Parrell : Yes. Thanks, everyone, for sticking around for the call, for this long call. I just want to put a quick plug in for our upcoming Investor Day that Jeff Spector alluded to a minute ago. We're going to host that on Tuesday, February 25. We look forward to spending some time at all of you discussing top-level strategy and a longer-term outlook for the business. It will be quite interesting and exciting. So we look forward to that. Thanks to everyone for joining us today. Operator : And once again, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
