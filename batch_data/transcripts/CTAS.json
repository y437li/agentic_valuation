Inc., Research Division Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division Sean Sun-Il Kim - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division Molly R. McGarrett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. William C. Gale: Thank you for joining us this evening as we report our first quarter results for fiscal 2014. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas's Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We are pleased to report first quarter revenue of $1,120,000,000 which represents growth of 6.6% from last year's first quarter. Our first quarter had one less workday than last year. Adjusting for this workday difference, revenue increased by 8.2% over last year's first quarter. Organic growth, which adjusts for both the impact of acquisitions and the difference in workdays, was 7.1%. As mentioned in today's press release, the organic growth for each of our 4 operating segments exceeded 6%. Mike will give more detail by operating segment in a few minutes. Our operating income for the first quarter was $140.1 million, which is 12.5% of revenue. This operating margin is 70 basis points lower than last year's first quarter operating margin of 13.2%. On our July earnings call, I indicated that comparisons to last year's first quarter would be difficult due to 3 items. First, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, our first quarter had less workday than last year. This had a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points on this year's operating margin due to a number of our large expenses, including rental material costs, depreciation and amortization, being determined on a monthly basis instead of a workday basis. Secondly, this year's first quarter recycled paper prices were over 20% lower than last year's first quarter recycled paper prices. This resulted in a negative impact to operating margin of 30 basis points compared to last year's first quarter. Finally, we began adding route capacity in the second quarter of last fiscal year, so last year's first quarter had none of the expenses associated with that capacity expansion. All in all, we are pleased with our first quarter operating margin results and a solid start to our fiscal 2014 year. First quarter net income was $77.8 million, and earnings per diluted share were $0.63. We were active with our share buyback program and purchased a total of 3 million shares of Cintas stock in the first quarter and into September. Since we purchased the shares in the latter part of the first quarter and in September, the buybacks had no impact on our first quarter earnings per share. However, we expect that these buybacks will benefit fiscal year 2014 EPS by about $0.04. We announced in July that our Board of Directors authorized an additional share repurchase program of $500 million. As of today, we have available for future share repurchases $15.4 million under the October 2011 board authorization and $500 million under the July 2013 board authorization. As Scott Farmer indicated in our press release, much uncertainty remains in the U.S. economy. The employment picture from month to month remains uneven and inconsistent, a reflection of businesses' uncertainty about future investment plans. As a result, we are maintaining our fiscal 2014 revenue expectations to be in the range of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion. We are updating our EPS expectations to include the impact of the buybacks through today so that we now expect fiscal 2014 EPS to be in the range of $2.70 to $2.79. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike for more details on the first quarter. J. Michael Hansen : Thanks, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 6.6% from the first quarter of last year, with total company organic growth being 7.1%. Total company gross margin for the first quarter was 41.6%, which is down from last year's first quarter gross margin of 42.4%. I'll discuss these items in more detail by segment. Before doing so, let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in our first quarter, which is one less than last year. In fiscal '14, we will have 65 workdays in each quarter, for a total of 260 workdays. This creates year-over-year workday differences in each quarter except the second and results in one less workday for the entire fiscal year. We have 4 reportable operating segments : Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the first quarter and totaled $792.9 million, which is up 5% compared to last year's first quarter. Adjusting for the one less workday in this year's first quarter, this segment's revenue grew 6.7%. Organic growth was also 6.7%. This was a nice uptick from the 4.8% organic growth rate in the fourth quarter. National account revenue penetration was strong during the quarter, which enhanced the growth. Additionally, sales rep productivity was strong, and net add-stops showed modest improvement over both last year's first quarter as well as the fourth quarter. Our Rental segment gross margin was 42.6% for the quarter, down from 43.3% in last year's first quarter. Energy-related costs were 10 basis points higher than last year's first quarter. The remaining decrease compared to last year was due to having one less workday in this year's first quarter and due to the costs associated with adding route capacity last fiscal year beginning in the second quarter. The first quarter gross margin of 42.6% improved from the 42.1% in the fourth quarter, despite having one less workday in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Energy-related costs were 30 basis points lower than the fourth quarter, and we did start to see improved efficiency in our recently added routes. Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sale revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the first quarter and totaled $107.5 million, which represented growth of 7.2% compared to last year's first quarter. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 27.7% for the first quarter, down from last year's first quarter gross margin of 29.4% and the fourth quarter gross margin of 30.8%. This decrease is mainly due to a greater mix of national account sales in the first quarter. National account sales generally have a lower gross margin than hospitality accounts. Our First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection revenue, which accounted for 11% of company revenue in the first quarter, was $125.9 million. This represents an increase of 13.6% over last year's first quarter revenue. Adjusting for one less workday in the first quarter compared to last year, revenue growth was 15.3%. Organic growth was 9.2%. This segment's gross margin was 43.6% in the first quarter, which is up 50 basis points from the 43.1% in last year's first quarter. Energy-related costs were lower by 20 basis points. The remaining improvement is due to better leveraging of the infrastructure, as well as an improved mix of high gross margin sales in the first quarter compared to last year's first quarter. These improvements were partially offset by the one less workday in this year's first quarter. The gross margin of 43.6% is relatively consistent with the fourth quarter gross margin of 43.5%. Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services, and it accounted for 8% of first quarter total company revenue. Document Management revenue totaled $94.1 million, which is 10.3% higher than last year's first quarter. Adjusting for one less workday in this year's first quarter, revenue increased by 12%. Revenue increased organically by 6.3% compared to last year. Average recycled paper prices remained relatively low at about $125 per ton, which is about $45 per ton lower than last year's first quarter average. Organic growth, excluding recycled paper revenue, was 10%. The first quarter gross margin was 45.9%, which is down from last year's first quarter gross margin of 49.1% and from the fourth quarter gross margin of 46.4%, primarily due to the drop in paper prices. However, we also invested in off-site shredding facilities in the past year to allow additional migration to the more efficient service model of off-site shredding. Switching to selling and administrative expenses, SG&A was 29.1% as a percent of revenue in the first quarter, which is down slightly from last year's first quarter figure of 29.2%. General and administrative labor was down as we continue to leverage our cost structure. This was somewhat offset by a 20 basis point increase in medical expenses. Our effective tax rate was 37.1% for the quarter, compared to 37.5% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. We expect the effective tax rate for the full fiscal 2014 year to be 37.3%. Turning now to the balance sheet, our cash and marketable securities were $283 million at August 31, down $75 million from the $358 million at May 31. This decrease was primarily due to using $101 million of cash for the share buyback program. Accounts receivable increased $15.6 million since May 31. DSOs were just below 40, which was slightly better than last year's first quarter. New goods inventory and in-service inventory levels at August 31 were $245 million and $500 million, respectively, both up just slightly from May 31 levels. We continue to be pleased with our ability to manage inventory levels appropriately. Accrued compensation and related liabilities at August 31 decreased by $35 million from the May 31 balance, mainly due to payment of fiscal year 2013 bonuses and commissions. Accrued liabilities decreased $37 million compared to May 31, primarily due to payments of accrued bond interest and accrued profit sharing. Long-term debt at August 31 was $1.3 billion. As of August 31, our total debt-to-EBITDA remains slightly below 2x. CapEx for the first quarter was $37.5 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows : $22.2 million in Rental; less than $1 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $3.3 million in First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection; and $11.3 million in Document Management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2014 to be in the range of $240 million to $260 million. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now be glad to answer any of your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : One just quick housekeeping question. Could you give us your share count at the quarter end and maybe today, given the late nature of the repurchases? J. Michael Hansen : The share count at the end of the quarter was 120,778,000. And for the year, we're modeling about 122.5 million shares. Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Right, okay. You saw a nice acceleration in uniform rental. And in your prepared remarks, you mentioned seeing some improvement in national accounts. Could you give us any more color on perhaps what type of national accounts and if you would expect that acceleration to continue? J. Michael Hansen : Sure. As you know, Sara, we have quite a few facility services offerings, and we saw some real nice penetration into our national accounts in -- particularly, in our cleaning areas, our floor cleaning, our emergency floor cleaning businesses, restroom cleaning. And as far as we'll -- do we expect that to continue, it's a little bit hard to say. But we certainly believe that our national account customers see the value of those products and services. But I would say, it's a little too early to tell whether we'll see that throughout the rest of the year. Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And then just last question. On the fourth quarter call, you mentioned that you'd be adding route capacity during fiscal '14, although not as much as in fiscal '13. Any change to those plans? J. Michael Hansen : No. We -- I would say, going forward, we'll typically add route capacity as necessary. And we'll generally add some in a -- certainly, in a growing environment. And where our new business remains strong, we'll continue to add routes throughout the year and into the future. I would say, though, it would not be at the pace that we saw beginning in the second quarter of last year. We did have a little bit of a catch-up for some -- from added capacity, so I wouldn't say we'd be at that same pace for the rest of the year. Operator : And we'll go next to Joe Box with KeyBanc. Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Just a bit of a follow-up on that question, more taking it from the margin angle. How do you think that we should be viewing incremental operating margins over the next couple of quarters? Obviously, they've been subdued as you've deployed more route capacity. Do you think that incremental margins should remain subdued? Or would it be reasonable to assume that they could potentially reaccelerate now that you'll actually be anniversary-ing the capacity expansions? William C. Gale: Well, Joe, it'll come down to where is the business coming from. As we've said on last several quarters, the more of our growth that comes from new accounts, the less improvement we'll see in margins because we have additional material costs, we -- that tends to fill up the routes a little faster. And therefore, you just don't get the rapid improvement in the margins. If, on the other hand, and we haven't seen this yet, but if on the other hand we were to see a real acceleration of growth of wares in existing accounts, then obviously, that would have a much better impact on the margins themselves. So I can't really tell you that. At this point, we did -- as Mike said, we had a modest improvement in our add-stops, but it wasn't significant. So we're still in a, I would say, a lackluster employment growth environment. Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay, fair enough. It looks like your first aid margins were actually the highest first quarter margins that you've had since the downturn. Just curious, is that a function of the benefits of scale? Are you getting a more favorable mix there? If you could just maybe give us any color on what's driving it and maybe how we should think about the upset from current levels. William C. Gale: I think it's kind of a scale situation. We have been developing our national footprint in the first aid and fire business over the last several years. And the more volume we have in those different markets, those -- some of those markets that are relatively small, the better impact that we have on our margins. I think it also is attributable to some of the initiatives the management team put in place to make sure that, that business was generating the profits that we think are appropriate. And they've done a good job at basically providing additional products and services offerings to their customers that have enhanced the revenue at each of the existing stops. So I think that's been -- that's also been a factor in it. Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Great. And then just one question on the buyback. Over the last few years, when you've been in the market buying stock, you done it in a meaningful way. I realize you obviously don't provide guidance on buybacks, but should we view this as a more one-off opportunistic quarter? Or would you say you're putting more emphasis on the buyback? William C. Gale: Well, I would say that it is -- we felt confident, given our board's directive, to proceed with the buyback that we did in this quarter, which I think was significant. As far as what we do going forward, it is all dependent on what happens with our other opportunities for uses of cash, our confidence in the future and how the board directs us to proceed with what they feel is the best way to enhance shareholder value. Operator : And we'll go next to Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital. Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Just one, first, quick question. I mean, it seems like you did some acquisitions like this quarter. I know you typically provide the breakout of where you did those in the Q. Could you just give us a flavor of maybe the spread this quarter? William C. Gale: They were primarily in the Document Management segment. I would say about 2/3 of it were Document Management and the other 1/3 -- or the other 30% or so was in our first aid and safety segment. Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division : All right. That's what I figured. So can you maybe just elaborate a little bit more around the -- just the Document Management side? Obviously, the organic growth there for the last 3 quarters has been in around that 6% mark. Is that a sustainable rate? And what the trends behind that are? William C. Gale: Well, the Document Management segment continues to provide us with a lot of acquisition opportunities because there are so many businesses doing document management around the country. And now that we have established a pretty decent national footprint, it behooves us to look for other tuck-in acquisitions that we can have in some of these markets in order to improve the profitability. So I think we're going to continue to see opportunities in Document Management going forward because there are just still so many out there. So at this point in time, we are very disciplined on it. We're making sure that they generate the returns we want. But we see this probably will continue for some time. J. Michael Hansen : And as Bill mentioned just a minute ago how our First Aid, Safety, and Fire segment's gross margin has benefited from the scale of these -- of adding more volumes. So these tuck-ins are quite nice to help the leverage and the gross margin and overall operating margins in those businesses. As they become bigger, we become more efficient. Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Yes. So I get that on the acquisition front. I guess I was trying to pin more on the organic side. So is a lot of the organic growth, then, being driven basically from accumulating all these prior acquisitions you guys have done and now finally benefiting from the footprint? Is that what the main driver there is? William C. Gale: Well, we've had pretty good organic growth, absent the fluctuations in paper prices, for some time in this segment. The benefits you'd get from having more locations available to you gives you opportunities on a national scale to sell a national account. So from that perspective, it does enhance organic growth. But I don't want to leave you with the impression that we couldn't grow organically if we didn't make these acquisitions. We feel very good about that, our ability to do that. But our goal has always been to become a national player in that business. Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Got it. And just one last thing. I mean, in terms of the guidance, obviously, you left the revenue unchanged. So -- and I guess tieing to the earlier question on if the organic growth on the rental side can continue this -- I guess, the 6.7% range. I guess -- I mean, that clearly implies there's probably some deceleration towards the back half. But would you say that's just more caution? Because, like you said, it's a lackluster environment, but there -- if these trends continue, obviously, there would be upside there. William C. Gale: I think it's a -- I don't want to call it conservative, but we want to factor in all the uncertainty that we still hear out there in the marketplace. I think the Fed's action yesterday gave you some indication of their view of the economy as relatively soft. So I would say, yes, we're being cautious, but I don't think unreasonably so, given all the other things that we continue to see and hear. J. Michael Hansen : This -- we mentioned that there was a modest improvement in net add-stops. This is not the first time we've seen a nice uptick in net add-stops only to be followed by a downturn. And as we've talked about quite often in the last couple of years, this employment picture is so bumpy and inconsistent that we're certainly hesitant to say that there is momentum. Operator : . And we'll go next to Andrew Wittman with Robert W. Baird. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : I guess since we've done some talking about document, I'm going to do one more and just talk about what's going on in that business. Obviously, paper prices have been kind of stubbornly low, I guess, I would say here. It's weighing on the overall profitability of that business, at least to the income statement. Can you talk about reaction in the marketplace on the service levels and the pricing for service levels? Are we starting to see that go up, in other words, to offset these paper price challenges? And just talk about another initiatives that you might have to improve the profitability there outside of paper prices. William C. Gale: You certainly have seen a, I would say, a stabilization of service pricing because some of these people just were trying to survive on the paper price itself, and they obviously cannot do that with the cost of servicing. So to the extent that there's an upside to lower paper prices, it's more rational service pricing. I think we've got to keep in mind, this paper price is driven by a lot of different factors from currency levels, from foreign demand, et cetera. We're going to see fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter. But I think the general trend is that what we saw in the first quarter was probably a low for the year. We expect there to be a more -- a slight increase as we go through the year, more comparable on average to what we saw last fiscal year. J. Michael Hansen : And Andy, as it relates to your question about improved profitability, one of the comments I had made was that we've invested -- we continue to invest in the business, and we've invested in some offsite shredding facilities, and that allows us to replace the very expensive, large shredding trucks with much smaller box trucks. We use less fuel because of that. We're able to see more customers because we're not shredding on-site. And so we get a lot of leverage and efficiency once we start to fill those off-site shredding facilities up. Today, we've got excess capacity in those shredding facilities because, as we've talked, we've just created a number of those in the last year or so. So we've got, certainly, a plan to create more efficiency and become more profitable in the business. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Got you. Can you help us get our arms around that trade-off from on-site to off-site shredding, what the economics look like, maybe the cost of a truck versus building a facility, just to help us understand what that could be? William C. Gale: I would say, I really don't want to get into details of that because it's -- some of it's kind of a strategic thing on how we're structuring these things and what we're paying for them. So suffice it to say that you can get more volume on a per capital dollar basis through an off-site shredding than you certainly can with an on-site shredding. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Fair enough. Jumping over to the core rental segment, then, can you talk a little bit about customer retention, the sales hiring pace and potentially the amount of new business that you're seeing in the market today? J. Michael Hansen : Customer retention is -- remains very good. We're at historically pretty high levels, and we feel very good about that customer retention. Sales productivity is very good. New business continues to be the fuel for the growth, and I would say I don't see that necessarily stopping in the next several quarters. We feel very good about the execution in that area. And as far as continued growth in that business, we certainly would love to see some better employment, some add-stops pickup, but we're not ready to certainly say that we've seen a trend from that employment. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Got it. So your sales force is flattish in terms of your headcount there? J. Michael Hansen : Well, we strategically will look for opportunities to add reps when we can, when it makes sense, if we have capacity that we want to fill up in certain markets, if we have additional prospects that we identify in certain markets. So we're generally adding sales reps as we see opportunities, and that will continue to happen throughout the year. We've not made any significant investments like we did about 3 years ago. But we'll continue to look for opportunities where it makes sense. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. Last one for now, was -- can you describe just -- like the characteristic of the new business wins? Is it still roughly 50-50 split between a no-programmer versus a market share gain? William C. Gale: I would say it's a little bit more no-programmer, probably 60%. We don't measure that every quarter, but the last time we looked at it, of course, in conjunction with the last fiscal year and basically looking, talking to our salespeople anecdotally, that seems to still be the case that it's a little more coming from the no-programmer. Competitive wins, sure, we're still there. We're still getting some competitive wins. But again, the preponderance or the -- let's say, the majority of the new business is no-programmers. Operator : And we'll go next to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Following up on that last question within rental. You've touched a bit on, obviously, new business, new programmers and then add-stops. Could you talk to pace of lost business? I imagine that, that stabilized nicely and perhaps an improvement for you in the overall picture. And then also taking it a step further into pricing and what type of environment you're seeing out there. J. Michael Hansen : Retention, like I said, is still pretty strong, and we didn't see any change in trend. It's -- our retention has been pretty good for the last couple years and has gradually improved, but we didn't see any difference or change in trend in the quarter. From a pricing standpoint, it continues to be very aggressive. And particularly, when it comes to a customer renewal, we're still seeing very aggressive competition. And so pricing is competitive. We're in a relatively low inflationary environment. And as it relates to us going to our customers and looking for price increases, it's generally a customer-by-customer conversation, but it's one that's not as easy to do in a low inflationary environment and where there is very competitive prices at renewal time. So it's been a difficult environment for price increases. I wouldn't say that it's changed much from the last several quarters, but it continues to be very competitive. Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Okay. On the cost side, obviously, nothing like what you saw 2, 2.5 years ago. Cotton prices starting to swing from down year-over-year to up year-over-year. Could you just address that? It doesn't look like that's going to be a major issue, and you certainly operated well through it last time we saw a spike in those, but could you readdress it? Also, any initiatives with regard to synthetics or any changes? William C. Gale: Well, the cotton price, what you -- the headlines are the spot prices, and they'll fluctuate just like all these other commodities do on a spot basis based on weather forecast and other things. Our global supply chain group is very cautious on ensuring that they have an adequate supply of low-cost products, and I am not too concerned right now by this recent increase. It's something we'll keep our eye on, but it certainly is nothing that I think is going to cause us any big difficulties going forward. Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Great. And just one more last. I noticed last sentence of the press release, discussion about guidance, including the impact of Affordable Care Act. Since the last that we heard from you, any changes in assumptions, expectations, strategy on how you may approach that? Still a lot up in the air, but just curious on an update. William C. Gale: Yes, I don't think anything has changed from the 2 months ago when we talked about this initially. We put in our guidance and what we talked about our fourth quarter that we expected a 10- to 30-basis-point increase in medical cost due to the Affordable Care Act. I have no reason to say that any different today. I think there's still a lot of uncertainty. A lot of things are still up in the air as to what is going to be put in, how it's going to be put in. So as far as I'm concerned, really nothing has changed in the last couple of months. All I can kind of be confident in saying, it's going to be more expensive than it had been. And I think we have reflected that appropriately in the guidance. Operator : And we'll go next to Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : I wanted to talk a little bit kind of around those last couple of questions. But when we talk about retention and we talk about pricing and the ability to bring on some new customers, whether it's a nonprogrammer or in a competitive bid, how important, at this point, is your diversity of services in terms of bringing that immediately to the table as an additional offering and something that maybe not all the other competitors offer? Is that helping you get in the door a little bit faster or winning a little bit more business or creating that additional retention above and beyond what you might have historically seen with maybe just 1 or 2 products? William C. Gale: Well, certainly, I think it -- and it does, we've proven to ourselves that adding additional products and services to a customer improves the retention of that customer because the more things you do for the customer, the less likely it is you're going to lose that customer. So I don't think there's any question about that. I think the variety of offerings that we have gives us more opportunities for new business for different types of customers. So we don't always lead with Uniform Rental. Depending on what the customers' needs are, we may get in there initially on tile and carpet cleaning or document shredding or first aid and safety. And then, I think, once they begin to know us and see us, then we share with them opportunities of other things we could do for them. So I think the fact that we have so many different things that we do probably gives us a broader spectrum on which to go after new business. Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : And is that still being identified by route person? Or how is that kind of changing if you're looking at more of a enterprise, what's best for the customer and what's best for Cintas to lead with? How are you able to identify that via the fact that -- I know there's different sales forces within each different segment. William C. Gale: Well, I think we've stratified our sales force to handle different-sized customers, different business units. So I think that's one way we do it. We have a fairly active marketing group that is constantly working with the sales organization, identifying prospects, identifying opportunities for all of our different service offerings or sale offerings. So it's -- with a sales force as large as we have, with the variety of different businesses we have, we've got a marketing committee for each of the businesses, which works -- meets every, what, 6 weeks, I think, to basically look at ways to penetrate other types of industry segments or other type of customers. So it's just a collaborative effort, Nate, that we're constantly looking for opportunities. Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay. Yes, I mean -- and that sounds great. It's just, I mean, at the end of the day, I think you're seeing some really nice trends in -- particularly in those other services, as alluded to. I mean, obviously, some decent strength. Part of that is scale and maturity, but part of that is, I feel like, the broader sales effort is probably making a few more inroads than it used to. William C. Gale: All right. Well, yes, well said. I totally agree with that. Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : And then just one last thing. I know you talked about this before, and people have asked you about it before, and I think it's probably still early and there's other macro things that mask this, but I think the more we see -- and every once in a while, we hear about another plant opening in terms of this kind of \"nearshoring\" on the heavy manufacturing-type theme, are you guys seeing any impact at all from that in terms of your somewhat industrial base of customers? Have you won any accounts that kind of feel that, that's been a benefit? And if so, do you think that there's anything to be said for whether that helps in terms of acceleration or not? William C. Gale: I'm sure there are cases where that's helped. I could not give you any real examples. I -- obviously, if you open a manufacturing plant anywhere in the U.S. that previously had not been there, that's not only going to provide an opportunity for that particular customer, but all of the businesses that serve that new facility. And so I think it's a more gradual-type thing that certainly helps the overall economy continue to grow. So we've seen growth in the economy, albeit modest -- more modest than we all would like, but we've seen growth. We've seen growth in our business, and I think that certainly, that has been a factor to the extent that there's been creations of new businesses within a particular area. Unfortunately, you also have continued closures and reductions of -- or elimination of businesses as we go through there, so we haven't seen this rapid growth, but -- so I think it's there. It's just probably just one element of why we're seeing some modest growth. Operator : And we'll go next to Sean Kim with RBC Capital Markets. Sean Sun-Il Kim - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : My first question is regarding CapEx. I think your CapEx was less than $40 million in the quarter, and yet, you're still guiding to $240 million to $260 million for the full fiscal year. So there is -- it seems like it's a pretty -- there's an increase over the rest of the year. And I'm trying to understand, you said the pace of route capacity additions will probably be slower, and yet your CapEx, I think, is going to go up. So I'm trying to understand what's going on there. William C. Gale: Probably the biggest reason, Sean, is as we talked about the CapEx guidance that we gave in July, which we've retained the same number, we indicated that one of the reasons for the relatively good-sized increase in CapEx and expectations in '14 versus '13 was the fact that we needed to build some new rental capacity, some new plants, and we had some initiatives on our ERP computer system. Those 2 items take a little bit longer to kind of work through the system. Decisions have to be made, we have to find land, we have to contract for the design of the building. So I would say that we would most likely see our CapEx higher as we go through the year under the presumption that we move forward with some of these new plants and with some of the ERP software initiatives that we thought we were going to do back in July. So we continue to evaluate that. As of right now, I have no reason to believe we're not going to do those things, and that's why we've retained the CapEx guidance where it's at. Sean Sun-Il Kim - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. Just one last question. In terms of gross margins in the Rental Uniforms segment, do you think we've sort of hit -- it's gone down for the past, say, 4 quarters or so, and now we're beginning to anniversary the route capacity additions. So do you think we've sort of hit bottom there and we're going to see some leverage there going forward? J. Michael Hansen : Well, I think we will. As we -- as our routes continue to get more efficient, we think that there will be some improvement there. But as Bill mentioned a little while ago, it really is hard to tell based on -- until we know where the revenue growth is going to continue to come from. If we were to see employment really pick up and our customers started hiring, we would really see some nice leveraging of those routes because we're adding revenue to the existing stops. If we continue to see the growth be driven by new accounts, then we may continue to add routes. And at some point, as Bill also said, we will add some plant capacity. And so it is dependent on where the revenue comes from. I would expect that our routes that we added last year will continue to get a little bit more efficient through this year. Operator : And we'll go next to Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Molly R. McGarrett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : This is Molly McGarret for Andrew. I just have one brief one. Can you give your view on sort of long-term targets, what you're thinking for top line growth and operating margins relative to prior peaks? If you bring it through this cycle, what will drive that in terms of the length of the cycle or penetration rate? What kind of variable do you think will drive that? William C. Gale: Well, Molly, as we have indicated on a number of occasions publicly and probably in previous calls, the top line growth rate that we're going to be able to achieve is going to be dependent, to a large extent, on the robustness of the economy. So let's put it this way : if we continue to see an economy growing as it has been for the last year or so, the growth rates that you're seeing today are probably what you're going to continue to see. We're not -- unless we see an acceleration of employment, we're not going to see an acceleration of our growth rates organically. With that said, I think as we've talked a lot about on this call, we also have initiatives underway to improve the profitability of our business where we're getting to scale in some of the newer businesses. We've done some things, I think, in the rental side that will continue to improve the profitability there. So I feel good about growth. I just would say that I'm not going to really believe that we can do something that's not possible organically unless the economy cooperates a little bit more robustly. Operator : And we'll go next to Gregory Halter with Great Lakes Review. Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review : I just wanted to be clear on what the rental business's organic revenue growth rate was, unadjusted, for the one less day? J. Michael Hansen : I -- we don't really calculate it that way, Greg. The total... Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review : Would it be the 5.0%? J. Michael Hansen : Well, that was the total growth for the quarter, unadjusted. Yes. William C. Gale: And there was no... J. Michael Hansen : Actually, there was no acquisition price [ph]. William C. Gale: Yes, there were no acquisitions. So yes, it basically -- well, 5% -- adjusting for the workday, 6.7%, because there were no acquisitions. J. Michael Hansen : Yes, right. Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review : Okay. That sounds good. And in your guidance, I know you mentioned the -- I believe, you're modeling 122.5 million shares for the year. And in the guidance, on the EPS, does that assume that there won't be any further share repurchases or that they're not being counted in there? J. Michael Hansen : That assumes that there will not be future share repurchases, yes. William C. Gale: Now keep in mind, too, when Mike gave the outstanding shares, you've got to adjust for share equivalents that are sitting out there in the form of invested restricted stock and stock options. So that's one reason why the number is higher. I just want to make sure everybody understands that. But no, our assumption is that -- and that's included in our guidance, too, is that there would be no further share buybacks because we just don't have any basis on which to say what they would be. Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review : Right. There's no 10b5-1 plan or anything like that in place? William C. Gale: Well, I didn't say that, but I just... Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review : Okay, one last one for you. On the rental business, I wonder if you could comment on how things like the fire-resistant clothing and Carhartt and womenswear are doing? William C. Gale: Fire-resistant clothing continues to be a very nice business for us, Greg. This is where I'm very enthusiastic about government regulation because it is forcing a lot of customers to basically provide these type of garments to their employees. And as a result of that, being the largest FRC provider in the world, we're doing well there. That, coupled with the fact that the energy sector is a big user of that and continues to grow nicely in the U.S., obviously, has been one of the reasons that we've seen some growth there. Carhartt continues to be a star within the company. There is a unique set of workers and people in this country that like that product, and we're the only one who can offer that as a rental product, and it has certainly been beneficial to us and continues to do so, less so than the FRC, but it certainly is a benefit. Womenswear has picked up a little bit. I would say I'm not as enthusiastic about the growth there yet. I think we need to continue to develop the appropriate type of garments that are appealing to women in different types of jobs on a rental program. And so I would say it's better than it was, but it could be a lot better, and we're continuing to look at different things. Operator : And we'll go next to Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : There's been a lot of talk about penetrating the health care market, I think, in the industry broadly. Can you just talk about some of your services that you're offering to the health care industry, some of the initiatives that you have in place? What would be really helpful is giving us some sort of size about the level of revenue that you're generating today from the health care industry and what your outlook is on for the growth rate there. William C. Gale: I certainly think health care opportunities will continue to be one of the reasons why we will grow. And the penetration rate is still very low. The focus that we have in health care from a rental side is more in the facility services and providing products that can enable a health care institution to provide the sanitation they need to avoid the in-house problems that they have with infectious diseases and that sort of thing. So we've worked with health care to come up with some products that can help keep their place cleaner and, on a rental basis, that provides cost-saving opportunities to the health care institution, and we're continuing to do that. We've made some inroads, but it's still small. We're not really focusing on the garments of the nurses and the health care providers that you would see, that you would just generally see, but rather looking at scrub rentals and the facility services-type products. Now, of course, health care is a big industry for us in the Document Management business and continues to be a driver in the growth of that business because of the privacy protection laws that all health care institutions need to worry about. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Can you help us by giving us a general size of that business, Bill or Mike? William C. Gale: No, I don't have that information available. And even if I did, Andy, I probably wouldn't be able to share it with you. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Bill Gale for closing remarks. William C. Gale: I want to thank everyone, again, for joining us this evening. We are very happy with these results, given the environment we're operating in, and we feel good about this year. So thank you, and we'll look forward to speaking with you in December, right before the holidays, when we announce our second quarter earnings. Operator : Thank you, everyone. That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. William C. Gale: Thank you for joining us this evening as we report our second quarter results for fiscal 2014. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We are pleased to report second quarter revenue of $1,144,000,000, which represents growth of 7.9% from last year's second quarter. The number of workdays in both this year's and last year's second quarters was 65. Organic growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, was 7.1%, the same organic growth we achieved in our first quarter. Mike will give more details by operating segment in a few minutes. Our operating income for the second quarter was $153 million, which is 13.4% of revenue. This operating margin is 30 basis points higher than last year's second quarter operating margin of 13.1%. It should be noted that last year's second quarter included an $8.5 million gain on the sale of an investment and a $1.6 million write-off of a garment processing system used in one of our rental locations. When adjusting for these 2 items, our operating margin actually improved by almost a full percentage point. We are also very pleased with our results so far in fiscal 2014. Second quarter net income was $84.9 million and earnings per diluted share were $0.70. It should be noted that our revenues and earnings per share were record quarterly amounts for Cintas and I wish to congratulate all of our Cintas employees who we call partners for this achievement. We also just recently paid our annual dividend of $0.77 per share, which was a 20.3% increase over last year's dividend and was the 31st consecutive year in which we raised our dividend. As Scott Farmer indicated in our press release, based on our second quarter results and our view of the U.S. economic climate, we are updating our fiscal 2014 guidance with revenue in the range of $4.525 billion to $4.575 billion and EPS in the range of $2.73 to $2.79. This guidance assumes no deterioration in the U.S. economy and does not consider any future share buybacks. In July, when we provided our initial guidance, we gave our expectation that fiscal 2014 medical expense would be higher than fiscal 2013 by 10 to 30 basis points due to the effects of the Affordable Care Act and that this impact would be seen in the second half of the fiscal year. While there remains a great amount of uncertainty about the impact of this program in the future, we still expect it to increase our medical expense in the second half of this fiscal year. However, the impact will likely be at the lower end of the 10- to 30-basis-point range provided in July. This expectation is included in our updated guidance. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike for more details on the second quarter. J. Michael Hansen : Thanks, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 7.9% from the second quarter of last year, with total company organic growth being 7.1%. Total company gross margin for the second quarter was 41.7%, which is an improvement from last year's second quarter gross margin of 40.7%. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment. Before doing so, let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in our second quarter, which was the same as last year. As we look ahead to the remainder of the fiscal year, our third quarter will have 65 workdays, whereas last year's third quarter had 64, so we will have one additional day. Our fourth quarter will also have 65 workdays, whereas last year's fourth quarter has 66 workdays, so we will have one less workday in the fourth quarter. For the full fiscal year, we will have 260 workdays, which is one less than last year's total. We have 4 reportable operating segments : Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as Other Services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 70% of company revenue in the second quarter and totaled $804.3 million, which is up 6.4% compared to last year's second quarter. Organic growth was also 6.4%. Sales rep new business and productivity continued to be strong. And similar to the first quarter, our national account revenue penetration was very good. Our Rental segment gross margin was 42.9% for the second quarter, an increase from 41.9% in last year's second quarter. Energy-related costs were comparable to last year's second quarter. As Bill mentioned, we wrote off a garment processing system during last year's second quarter. Excluding this impact, Rental gross margin improved by 80 basis points. As we've discussed on previous calls, we began to increase our route capacity in last year's second quarter and we have now lapped that initial investment. The efficiency of these routes has improved throughout the past 12 months and has helped to improve Rental's gross margin. In addition, we continue to see improved leveraging of our plant infrastructure. The Rental segment's second quarter gross margin of 42.9% was also an improvement from the 42.6% in the first quarter. Energy-related costs were about 10 basis points lower than the first quarter, but improved route efficiency and plant infrastructure leverage also contributed to the improvement. Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the second quarter and totaled $121.9 million, which represented sales growth of 10.6% compared to last year's second quarter. We've been very pleased with the Uniform Direct Sales revenue this fiscal year, which is up 9% for the 6 months ended November 30. In fact, Uniform Direct Sales revenue was up 11.5% for the trailing 12 months. Having said that, the nature of this business is that the revenue can be quite choppy based on the timing of large national account program rollouts. As we've discussed on previous calls, we had several very large national account rollouts during the second half of last fiscal year, which will not repeat this year. As a result, we expect Uniform Direct Sale revenue for the second half of fiscal '14 to be down 5% to 10% compared to last year's second half. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 28.8% for the second quarter, up from last year's second quarter gross margin of 27.4% and the first quarter gross margin of 27.7%. This increase is mainly due to a greater mix of hospitality account sales in the second quarter and better leveraging of our distribution network infrastructure. Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue, which accounted for 11% of company revenue in the second quarter, was $124.6 million. This represents an increase of 11.7% over last year's second quarter revenue. Organic growth was 8.8%. This segment's gross margin was 43.4% in the second quarter, which is up 100 basis points from the 42.4% in last year's second quarter. Energy-related costs were lower by 20 basis points. The remaining improvement is due to better leveraging of the infrastructure, particularly at the warehouse level. The gross margin of 43.4% is relatively consistent with the first quarter gross margin of 43.6%. Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services and it accounted for 8% of second quarter total company revenue. Document Management revenue totaled $93 million, which is 12.2% higher than last year's second quarter. Revenue increased organically by 6.9% compared to last year. Average recycled paper prices remained at about $125 per ton, which is down about 17% from last year's second quarter average. Organic growth, excluding recycled paper revenue, was 9.4%. The second quarter gross margin was 45.7%, which is an increase from last year's second quarter gross margin of 45.4%. Energy-related costs were 30 basis points lower than last year. The lower recycled paper prices had a negative impact of $1.9 million on Document Management's gross margin. Using the same recycled paper prices last year, the second quarter gross margin would have improved by about 140 basis points. This improvement is due to our continued migration from on-site to off-site shredding and better performance in both our North American and European storage businesses. Switching to selling and administrative expenses, SG&A was 28.3% as a percentage of revenue in the second quarter, which is up from last year's second quarter figure of 27.6%. However, as Bill mentioned, last year's second quarter SG&A included an $8.5 million gain from the sale of stock in an investment. Adjusting for this onetime item, last year's second quarter SG&A percentage would have been 28.4% compared to this year's 28.3%. Our effective tax rate was 37.9% for the quarter compared to 36.5% last year. Last year, our second quarter effective tax rate reflected the favorable impact of a change to certain tax regulations. We have no similar items in this year's second quarter. We expect the effective tax rate for the full fiscal 2014 year to be 37.3%. Turning now to the balance sheet. Our cash and marketable securities were $313 million at November 30, an increase of $30 million from the $283 million at August 31. Accounts receivable increased $8.9 million since August 31. DSOs were slightly below 40, which was a nice improvement from the 43 in last year's second quarter. New goods inventory and in-service inventory levels at November 30 were $249 million and $509 million, respectively, both up slightly from August 31 levels. Accrued liabilities at November 30 increased from the August 31 balance, primarily due to the accrual of our annual dividend that was paid on December 11. Long-term debt at November 30 was $1.3 billion compared to the amount -- comparable to the amount at August 31. Net cash provided by operating activities for the second quarter was $140 million, an $8 million improvement over last year's second quarter. And CapEx for the second quarter was $39.3 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows : $24.4 million in Rental; less than $1 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $4.4 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $10.1 million in Document Management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2014 to be in the range of $225 million to $250 million. This concludes our prepared remarks and we will now be glad to answer any of your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Could you give us a sense of how you see organic growth proceeding through the balance of the year, particularly looking at year-over-year comps in the Rental business? William C. Gale: Andrew, our expectation is that we should see mid single-digit growth, organic growth, in the Rental business, again, assuming that the economy kind of stays in the mode that it's in. We saw a decent jobs report in the month of November. However, it was choppy relative to the prior months. So our expectation is we're going to continue to see that choppiness and, therefore, as a result of that, we expect that most of our growth is going to come from new business, which is what has been happening so far this year. And therefore, we're targeting somewhere in that mid single-digit area. Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Yes. I would also love for you to build and make a comment about add-stops. When I look at the end markets for uniforms and look within the labor report, it just seems like we've moved past the bottom and there's been a little bit of acceleration in the end markets that you guys served the most since the summertime. Do you characterize the fall in the same way? William C. Gale: I don't -- I'm not as bullish on it as you have -- as you are, Andrew. I looked at it -- Mike and I have been looking at it. We study it every month. And I will agree with you, November looked good, as I just said earlier, but October was poor. There just is no consistency to our -- as we look at it. So I would hope that it might pick up and stay consistent, but right now, I have to be honest and say I'm not confident that, that level -- that it will continue. We saw -- if you look at our add-stops, we've kind of had some choppiness. We've talked about it being up one quarter and then down another quarter. And if you look at our add-stop in the second quarter, it was slightly down compared to the first quarter and to the second quarter last year. So we sure haven't seen any robust improvement in hiring among our existing customers yet. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division : This is actually Greg calling on for Manav. And going off of what Andrew said, could you give a little bit of your thoughts on which verticals you're starting to see improvement in, just comparing the different verticals and where the hiring environment has been picking up a little bit versus some of the others? William C. Gale: I would say that we continue to see reasonable strength in the energy sector and we're seeing building strength in the health care arena. Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. And just one more. On the rollout of the ERP system, maybe just a little update there on how the rollouts work for First Aid and Document Management and when you think you're going to move on to some of the next stages? William C. Gale: We are about 60% to 70% through the rollout in Document Management and First Aid -- the First Aid business. It has had a few bumps in the road, but we've overcome them. We've had some issues, technical issues, that we've been very -- working very closely with our ERP provider to rectify and I think we've gotten over that now. So our expectation is we will complete that rollout in those 2 businesses sometime in mid-calendar '14. At that point in time, we will be most likely embarking upon a design effort for 1 or 2 of our other businesses. We're going to be making that decision here over the next several months. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : You've had a nice gross margin expansion, particularly on an underlying basis in Rental Uniforms. And I'm wondering if you think that 80-basis-point year-over-year expansion is a reasonable run rate for the second half of the year. J. Michael Hansen : Well, we do believe that we will continue to see some expansion. As we say often, Sara, a lot depends on where the revenue comes from. And if new business continues to be the driver, the expansion will be a little more muted. If we do see continued -- a continued trend like we saw in November employment, then, and we have our customers hiring, we may see some better expansion. Built into our guidance, though, I would say probably something similar to the second quarter levels. Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And how should we think about longer-term gross margin potential in that segment? J. Michael Hansen : Well, we've talked a little bit. When we've talked earlier in the year about our CapEx expectations, we did discuss that, in some cases, in some markets, we're running out of plant capacity. So we will talk -- probably have to invest maybe at the end of this fiscal year or into next fiscal year. So there may be some investment that we have to do to add some capacity, but generally speaking, we expect continued margin improvement over time. Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And then last quarter, you talked about of your new business wins about 60% were no programmers and 40% you thought were market share. And I know that you don't look at that every quarter, but I'm just wondering, if there's any reason, as you look at, at the marketplace, to think that, that's changing? J. Michael Hansen : No. I would say there's no reason to think that's changing. That's been pretty consistent as we've come out of the recession and I wouldn't expect that, that would change much. Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Great. And then just last question. So nice to hear that you think your health care increases will be at the low end of prior expectations. I'm just wondering why, what's driving those lower. J. Michael Hansen : Well, when we thought about how this would impact us, there were a couple of different things. First, there are -- there's something called a transitional reinsurance fee, which we know will happen. There are other administrative costs and expenses that will happen. The other thing that we expected to happen was that more people would come onto our insurance plan, both for the higher dependent ages because of the individual mandate and also because we thought other companies may be eliminating their coverage or at least making it less beneficial. And while we did see an increase in the number of enrollments more than normal, it was less than we had originally feared. So yes, we think it's going to be the cost of the administration, the reinsurance and more participants. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Hamzah Mazari with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Just a question on the national account business. You've talked about that being pretty competitive. Could you give us a sense of how much of that is related to just the economy being choppy versus potential overcapacity in the industry? William C. Gale: I'm not quite sure I understand your question. Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I'm just asking on the national account business. Could you give us an update of how competitive pricing is in that business? William C. Gale: Well, yes, it remains very competitive. We believe that part of the reason that our national account business continues to be strong is our relatively broad product offering that we have, especially compared to some of our other industry participants. So when we go to some of our national account customers, we are able to offer more than just one particular product offering, be it like a uniform program or an entrance mat program or whatever. So I think as a result of having a number of different things, we're able to be more successful with some of these national account customers and bundle different products and services for them and that enables us to probably have greater penetration than others. Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Great. That's helpful. And just a follow-up. If you could give us a sense of sort of what your expectations are on sort of building out capacity going forward. William C. Gale: Well, we certainly -- as Mike mentioned a few minutes ago, we certainly are seeing some pressure points in some of our geographic markets for need for some capacity in the Rental business. And as a result of that, we have several projects underway at various stages that anticipate the building of additional capacity. It takes a while to do that, in that you've got to find the right piece of land, negotiate for that and then, obviously, design and build out the facility. So based on where we're at today versus where we thought we would be, I would tell you that we're a little behind our original timetable on building some of that capacity. It certainly hasn't cost us to not be able to grow in a market, but we've been able to utilize what we have. But as a result of that, I would expect our CapEx to pick up in the latter part of this year and maybe bleed over into 2015. That is certainly going to require more cash flow to build the plants, but also as Mike said, could cause a little bit of short-term, a less robust improvement in gross margin as a result of that. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Joe Box with KeyBanc. Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Just a quick clarification on that. So you're -- it looks like you're taking down your CapEx guidance by about $10 million to $15 million or so. Is that all based on the new plants that you're constructing? And is it, basically, all just push-out into the next year? William C. Gale: Yes, pretty much so. Yes, Joe. Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay. Perfect. And then just switching over to the First Aid side. Over the last couple of quarters, you guys have put up pretty good margins performance there. And it sounded like you were starting to get some scale benefits. I guess it seems to me like you might have taken a little bit of a step back this quarter on an easy comp. Was there something specific there within First Aid? J. Michael Hansen : Well -- the gross margin improved. And you're talking about sequentially or year-over-year, Joe? Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Year-over-year on the operating margin side. J. Michael Hansen : Yes. So in the gross margin, we improved by about 100 basis points and I talked a little bit about that in my prepared remarks. On an SG&A basis, there is some reflection of the investment in SAP. And keep in mind, that's a pretty large endeavor in both Document Management and First Aid and Safety. And you do see a little bit of an increase in the SG&A this quarter year-over-year for both of those businesses. And while we certainly expect benefit from that system, it is not a 1- to 2-year payback. So that's the blip that you're seeing in SG&A that kind of falls down to that operating margin. Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : I mean, is that something that we should expect to see, then, flow through over the next several quarters or is that a \"blip?\" J. Michael Hansen : Well, I think what you'll -- I think you'll still see that level of investment as we implement the project. So while we're in the implementation phase, we do have some groups of people going around and training our new users. And so there are some additional costs that will likely, as Bill said, run through the rest of this fiscal year. And then we should be almost fully implemented by mid-calendar '14. So I wouldn't expect that incremental cost to continue, but certainly, there's the cost of SAP that will continue. Having said that, we expect to get benefit going forward. And that benefit will come through better information, better price reviews. And that should come, it's just not a quick turn. Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Right. Just a quick question on pricing on your legacy Uniform Rental business. I know pricing is still probably very competitive, but we are starting to get some chatter that it could be loosening up for non-national accounts. Is that something that you've seen or is it still a bit premature? William C. Gale: Joe, we have so many operations around the country and different customers we're going to. I hear anecdotally lots of different things. I cannot confirm for you that I've heard that take place. I mean, I hear some markets, it's -- \"Oh, this is more aggressive. We've seen it.\" In other markets, \"Yes, it's firming up.\" So from what I'm hearing, I can't confirm that, that's happening based on our experience. Operator : We'll take our next question from Andrew Wittmann with Baird. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : So just maybe a couple of bookkeeping things here. Maybe this is in the commentary, but can you comment on the number of shares repurchased and maybe the average price? It looks like -- I get about 961,000 shares, about $59 per share, but can you give us the real numbers? J. Michael Hansen : We purchased about 1.2 million shares during the quarter. We talked about most of those purchases were prior to our first quarter earnings release. We have about $505 million remaining on the authorization. We bought about 3.2 million shares for the year. Andy, I don't have in front of me the average price. That will show up in our Q. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Yes. Okay. And then can you -- Mike, maybe a little bit of detail inside -- Mike, I think I ask this question every quarter, but can you give us some color inside the Rental segment between kind of core uniform wearing versus the facility services? Are you seeing any differentiation in the growth rates between those business? Maybe some color there. J. Michael Hansen : We're seeing real good growth in all of the pieces within the Rental business. And while we don't disclose the different pieces individually, I'll say that garments are growing nicely. And the different businesses within the facility services : the dust; the chemicals; hygiene products and services; our deep clean business, all those businesses are growing fairly well and there's not any real overweighting of any of them. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Got it. The -- just in terms of, so, a year ago, we've now lapped the investments in human capital that you made in terms of routes and maybe some more salespeople. Can you just talk about kind of where you are in that curve right now? Are we still folding those and ramping those new routes up? Or are we at the point where, in addition to plant capacity, we need some more route capacity? Can you just talk about where we are in that today versus a year ago and if there's an expectation for growth there? William C. Gale: We always are going to be adding routes. So as long as we grow, we're going to be adding routes. But we you don't anticipate, at this point, adding routes to the same degree we did a year ago. So the fact that we have gone a year now from the -- kind of the unusual surge in number of routes has certainly -- we're starting to feel the positive impact of that as those routes build up. And I think that was part of the reason you saw some improvement in the margin in the Rental business. Right now, Andy, unless there is a major increase in the revenue growth rate, I think routes capacity will be added at a -- kind of a nominal pace going forward. Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : That's very helpful. Maybe one last question here in the Affordable Care Act. With some of the provisions changed and others delayed, we've got the outlook for this fiscal year. Is there any way -- is there anything that's changing about your out-year look out from the -- outlook from the experience that you've had so far in rolling people for calendar 2014 that makes you think that maybe the longer-term effect in your fiscal '15 is maybe greater than or less than your previous expectation? William C. Gale: I guess I'm somewhat encouraged by the fact that we didn't have as many participants coming onto the program that we had feared might happen. But there is so much yet to be played out on this whole thing with some of the delays and parts of the law and that certain businesses do not have to necessarily add or offer the service. I think we've got to wait and see. I just don't think we have enough information yet to know what the full effect of this thing is going to be. And therefore, while we kind of are set now for our enrollment for '14, we really don't know what's going to happen to the cost structure and the -- because we're self-insured, and what ends up happening from the standpoint of the cost per head. So I think we've just got to wait and see, Andy. Operator : And we'll take our next question from John Healy with Northcoast Research. John M. Healy - Northcoast Research : Guys, I wanted to ask a little bit about the fire resistant garments segment. There's been a little discussion in the industry that maybe that market is showing a little plateauing or just baselining of the growth rate. And I was curious to get your thoughts on what's happening in that end market from a demand perspective. And maybe some color in terms of what that might represent as a percentage of the uniform business today. William C. Gale: I think there's been a little bit of a slowdown in that business, John, only because you were comparing it to that robust growth that we were seeing, as energy was just booming throughout the country here a couple of years ago and through most of last year. But given the fact that we've kind of seen a plateauing of that, obviously, our new business is not as big as it was. However, we are still the largest provider in that market. I don't think there's been, really, a reduction in the number of employees in the energy sector that are required to wear these garments. We really haven't seen any big competitive situation. It's just that you're not seeing that many -- as many oilfield workers going forward. But our FRC business is still one of the highlights of our Rental business and continues to be. John M. Healy - Northcoast Research : Got you. And I want to ask you a big picture question. Bill, you're always good at giving us a read on how you feel about the economy. And just kind of as we move into the calendar year, I mean, you've had a great last 6 months of the business and your growth rates kind of organically show like there's a little bit of moderation. But I guess if you do the postmortem on calendar 2013, did the business and the economy maybe feel -- come out better than you might have thought? And then, I guess, as you look to calendar '14, are you feeling better about where we're at versus 6 months ago? Or -- I'd just appreciate any color or perspective you could provide there. William C. Gale: Well, I would say '13 -- calendar '13 certainly turned out to be modestly better than what I had originally expected and I think we have seen similar results in many businesses. So I think many businesses were able to adapt to a slow growth environment and have done quite well in it. As we look into '14, we kind of see -- right now, I think our expectation is more of the same. We don't see any catalysts out there to really improve growth substantially, nor do we see anything on the horizon that would throw us yet into a recession. So right now, I guess we're kind of thinking, it should be comparable to what we saw this year. With that said, I think people have to keep in mind, though, it has not been a consistent year -- or month-over-month improvement. There's been some real choppiness that we've seen throughout '13. And I kind of think that maybe is what we'll see in '14. But when you step back and look at it, you'll say, \"Oh, okay, that wasn't a bad result given what kind of pressures continue to exist out there in the economy.\" John M. Healy - Northcoast Research : Okay, great. And just final question. In the first quarter, you guys were kind enough to call out the operating margin headwind associated with the lack of the workday. I think it was around 50 basis points or so. Is that a realistic type of benefit we should expect just from a comp standpoint in the third quarter, given the extra workday that should benefit you guys? J. Michael Hansen : Yes, I think that's a reasonable way of looking at it, John. We'll get the same kind of impact in that we'll have an extra day of revenue to cover things like depreciation, amortization of the garments and other rental items. So I think that's a good way of looking at it. William C. Gale: But then keep in mind, the fourth quarter, you're going to have that negative comparison again. Operator : And we'll take our next question from George Tong with Piper Jaffray. George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : I'd love to revisit the margin discussion a little bit, particularly around the uniform rental business. On one hand, we're definitely seeing improvements in route productivity. That's balanced, I think, somewhat by the fact that the non-program [indiscernible] isn't really changing and isn't really expected to change over the next couple of quarters. So can you talk a little bit about how those dynamics are going to play out and how you expect margins to play out over the course of the fiscal year and into fiscal '15? J. Michael Hansen : Well, as we talked a little bit earlier, we would expect that the routes that we added last year will continue to become more efficient. In probably the next 6 months, we'll see continued improved leveraging of our plant infrastructure. But probably, towards the end of the fiscal year, maybe in the next fiscal year, we will have some investments to make in different pockets for plant capacity. So that will certainly affect us going into fiscal '15. And, George, again, it just -- there's a lot of dependent -- a lot of dependence on how the revenue comes. And if we see the kind of year that Bill just kind of mapped out, then I would expect to see some continuing improvement, with a little bit of impact of the investment that I mentioned. Does that help? George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : That's helpful, Mike. And could you give us an updated view on what employment figures need to be [indiscernible] acceleration in organic performance? William C. Gale: Well, we would -- I think we've kind of looked at it, George, and said that if we could see -- I'm going to throw out this as a general number because it really will depend where the job growth is coming -- but if you can see job growth consistently, 250,000 plus a month, that generally correlates to existing businesses adding employees. And as long as that's kind of across the whole economy, then we would see the impact of that happening on our customers and, therefore, we would see an improved add-over-stop rate. Operator : We'll take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : I don't have too many questions left, but we talked a lot about expanding the routes and how that's been productive. Can you talk a little bit more about products that you've added in the various lines of business that you have and in the last, say, year or 2 and how some of that is driving some of the growth? Or is it really just adding the routes and that's really what it is? William C. Gale: Well, I think we've expanded some of our offerings in, like, the hygiene arena, Shlomo, which has helped us grow a little bit faster in certain segments. But I don't know if it's really any other significantly new products other than that. I think it's just been, generally, additional penetration of customers with some of those products. And we've talked, for example, of the chemical dispensing business, still a relatively small part of our business, but that has been an add-on to many of our hospitality-type customers. So that's been beneficial to us. Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then can you talk a little bit about the floor cleaning business and how many cities you're in? Are you continuing to expand that now? William C. Gale: I don't know exactly how many cities we're in. We are in many of the major markets across the U.S. Right now, our focus has been on additional penetration within those markets that we're in as opposed to opening up new markets, because we'd like to take advantage of the management structure that's required to run that operation. But I would tell you that, I would think we're -- we've got to be in 50 of the top 100 MSAs. Operator : We'll take our next question from Dan Dolev with Jefferies. Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Just really quickly back to the economy. I did notice that on the press release, Scott said that he's seeing some signs of economic growth beginning to appear. And I looked back and I saw that this was compared to a previous press release which said that there's still no any evidence in the economy. Was that just November? Am I reading too much into that? And maybe you can please explain what he was saying versus what you were saying, that you're not that bullish. William C. Gale: It's the holiday season, Dan. We were just trying to be optimistic. No, I'm teasing. I would tell you that it certainly feels a little better to us as we've gone through now 2 quarters of our fiscal year. The fact that, yes, it's still been choppy. And as I mentioned to Andrew at the top of the call, we still have no good consistency. But when you kind of look at the stock market and what's happening with that, you sense that maybe Washington is at least getting together -- or getting along a little bit better. I guess there's kind of a feeling that, \"Okay, things are not going to be back like they were in the '90s, but maybe we're going to be okay.\" And so we kind of sense that in talking with our customers. And we looked at the November jobs report and we said, \"Hey, that wasn't bad.\" So -- and I think we've had 2 quarters now in a row of each one of our business segments grew organically more than 6%. So I think that gives us some comfort to say, \"Okay, maybe things will be all right.\" Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : That's good. I hope so. One other question on shredding. You are growing very fast. And Iron Mountain, I don't think, discloses the growth in shredding, but I'm estimating they're growing about 3%, which is well below you. So are you just -- can you maybe tell us what the market is growing at? And it looks like you're gaining a lot of share and who you're gaining share from. William C. Gale: I do not have any statistics on what the market is growing, so I -- and I really can't comment on anything Iron Mountain does. All I can tell you, Dan, is that, yes, we've seen a nice pickup in our service revenue. And while the paper prices continue to be a little bit of a headwind, we are pleased with the business. We -- our model has been one of converting to more off-site shredding and that seems to be going very well. We've had some nice wins on some pretty good-sized national account customers. So I think that's been benefiting us. And I would say that we are taking business primarily from the smaller players because more and more companies realize that they're not really engaging a company to do waste pickup. They're engaging a company to do privacy protection. And they've got to be sure that it is securely handled and that companies have the standards to do that. And I think that has helped us with our growth rate. Operator : We'll take our next question from Sean Kim with RBC Capital Markets. Sean Sun-Il Kim - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : First, on guidance. I think when you guys initially gave guidance, it assumes sort of mid single-digit organic growth in the Rental segment. It's come in a little bit ahead of that in the first half. So I guess it makes sense for you to raise the lower end, but just wondering why you guys lowered the top end of the guidance as well. William C. Gale: Well, I think part of that is driven by the fact of paper prices. And the Document Management business have not rebounded as much as we had initially hoped. I think it also is attributable to what Mike was talking about in the direct sale business in that we are not going to have as good a second half as we did in the first half and as we did in the second half last year. And as we got closer to that period, we don't have any other big rollouts that are going to happen to replace that business. And I think it's just the general conservative view of what we see we might have to deal with. We get into the winter -- if we have a bad winter, that has a bit of an impact on our business. So I think it's just -- it's all those factors together, Sean. I wouldn't read too much into it, other than it's not as optimistic as we hoped it might have been when we started the fiscal year, but it's certainly not as pessimistic as we feared it might be when we started. Sean Sun-Il Kim - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay, great. Just one more, if I may. I think, historically, you guys have done more share repurchases in the fiscal first quarter and the fourth quarter. Is that -- did you think that's something we should expect in fiscal '14 as well, sort of acceleration in buybacks towards the end of the fiscal year? William C. Gale: Well, I will remind everyone that during the first quarter and into early the second quarter of fiscal '14, we did purchase 3.2 million shares. Whether or not we will purchase any shares in the fourth quarter is subject to our board's direction. And I can't predict at this time nor can I signal what we may do. So I -- all I would say is past practice is sometimes an indication of the future. Operator : We'll take our next question from Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review. Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review : I noticed that in the quarter, I think there was only about $300,000 or so in M&A. I don't know if you addressed this, but I'm wondering what your thoughts are there going forward. And it kind of piggybacks on the question before that. You're obviously -- just boosted the dividend by over 20%. And if there were not to be any share repurchases, your cash would be growing very rapidly here, leading either to debt reduction or cash on the balance sheet that's not... William C. Gale: That's not what? [Technical Difficulty] William C. Gale: All right, I'll try to answer his question. Hopefully, he can hear the answer. I think acquisitions always are going to be somewhat unpredictable. We did -- certainly, we do continue to have a very active full-time M&A staff within our company that is constantly looking for good acquisitions. And unfortunately, in the second quarter, we did not have a lot of meeting of the minds with sellers as to the appropriate valuations and, as result of that, we didn't make them. That doesn't necessarily mean that's going to happen in the third and fourth quarter because there's always ongoing discussions. And I don't know what will happen. I can't predict that. Regarding the cash buildup, it's a nice problem to have in that it gives us a lot of options for maximizing shareholder value. And I think our board has shown a pretty good process of putting that cash to appropriate use and I don't expect that to change. Operator : And we'll take our next -- actually, at this time, we do have one question remaining in the queue. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Following up on M&A, just on where you're looking there, Bill. Should we think you're primarily focused in Document Management, still? Is there activity in Rental? Just across your segments, thoughts on where you may be more or less active. William C. Gale: Scott, we're actually active in all of the business segments, I'd say, with the exception of direct sale. There is not a lot of value to buying direct sale businesses, generally. So we don't spend a lot of effort there, but in all -- in the other 3 segments, we continue to evaluate different opportunities. Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Great. And then last year, you said that the Superstorm Sandy had an adverse impact, but that it was not material. Curious, the weather has been solid this quarter, any benefit or risk on comparison from that? And then just taking that a step further, how would you kind of rank order the 3 biggest drivers of year-over-year margin expansion? William C. Gale: Certainly, because of what we said last year, we knew there were a lot of concern that people thought that Hurricane Sandy might have an impact on us and that's why we made the comment that it was a minimal impact, it wasn't material. So I can't really say that we had any benefit this quarter of any -- because it wasn't material to begin with. Relative to the components of the gross margin improvement, I would say the most of it has come from the route, utilization of the leveraging off the route additions; and then, secondarily, probably from the plant utilization. And then we -- I think we had a minor energy pickup, didn't we, Mike, quarter-over-quarter? J. Michael Hansen : It was minor, if there was one. Yes, it was comparable. It was primarily those 2 items. Operator : And it appears there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. William C. Gale: I want to thank everyone for joining us during this very busy time of the year. Appreciate your interest in Cintas. And on behalf of all of the Cintas family, we want to wish everyone a very happy holiday season and a successful 2014. Operator : And again, this does conclude today's Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. We thank you again for your participation.",

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Bill Gale - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Good evening and thank you for joining us. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas\u2019 Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our fiscal 2014 third quarter results. In addition, we will discuss this morning\u2019s press release in which we announced an agreement o combine our Document Shredding business with Shred-it International. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company\u2019s current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We are pleased to report third quarter revenue of $1.130 billion, which represents growth of 5.1% from last year\u2019s third quarter. Our third quarter had one more workday than last year. Adjusting for this workday difference, revenue increased by 3.5% over last year\u2019s third quarter. Organic growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and workday differences, was 3.1%. Let me provide some color on our organic growth figure. First, we experienced a weaker Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacting organic growth by 0.5 percentage points the. Second, we had a difficult year-over-year comparison due to our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment having the largest uniform program rollout in the company\u2019s history during last year\u2019s third and fourth quarters. This adversely impacted this year\u2019s organic growth by 1.7 percentage points. Finally, revenue in this year\u2019s third quarter was impacted by the severe winter weather experienced by the majority of the United States. There were numerous days, in which our operations or our customers or both were closed as a result of the severe condition. Due to the nature of our businesses, the effects were greatest on our first aid, safety and fire protection services and document management services operating segment. Our operating income for the third quarter was $150 million or 13.3% of revenue. This operating margin was 90 basis points higher than last year\u2019s third quarter operating margin, up 12.4%. Much of this improvement was the result of a very strong performance by our rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment. Also the additional workday in this year\u2019s third quarter had a positive impact on operating margin due to the number of our large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation and amortization being determined on a monthly basis instead of a workday basis. Third quarter net income was $84.6 million and earnings per diluted share were $0.69, a 15% increase over the EPS of $0.60 in last year\u2019s third quarter. As Scott Farmer stated in our press release, despite the many headwinds this quarter, we grew earnings at a double-digit rate. We are pleased with our results for the quarter and fiscal year-to-date and we complement our employees who we call partners. We especially recognize the hard work and dedication of our route-based operations and partners who were challenged by this winter severe conditions. Earlier today, the company announced an agreement with the shareholders of Shred-it International Incorporated to combine Cintas\u2019 Document Shredding business with Shred-it\u2019s Document Shredding business. Under the agreement, Cintas and Shred-it will each contribute its Document Shredding business to a newly formed partnership that will be owned 42% by Cintas and 58% by the shareholders of Shred-it. The combined entity will operate under the Shred-it brand and is expected to have annual revenue in excess of $600 million. In addition to its 42% ownership of the partnership, Cintas will receive approximately $180 million in cash at the closing of the transaction, which is expected to occur before May 31, 2014. Following closing the new company will be led by Vince DePalma, current Chief Executive Officer of Shred-it, who will become CEO of the new venture and Karen Carnahan, current President and Chief Operating Officer of the Cintas\u2019 Document Management Division, who will become COO of the new venture. The partnership will allow the Document Shredding businesses of both companies to leverage the combined scale and create synergies in a way to generate more profitable growth for shareholders, additional opportunities for employees and better service to customers. Such synergies include one IT platform taking advantage of the enhanced revenue and lower cost of plant-based shredding facilities versus on-site shredding and improve route efficiency and density. We also see this transaction as in the best interest of our shareholders due to the opportunity to enhance value as noted above but also due to the nature of the shredding business. The volatility of the paper price we receive for the shredded paper creates an unpredictable variable in performance that is not present in our other segments. Additionally while we\u2019ve found many opportunities to extend service offerings in our other segments the same does not exist in the Document Destruction business. Based on our third quarter results and our view of the U.S. economic climate we\u2019re updating our fiscal 2014 guidance with revenue in the range of $4.550 billion to $4.575 billion and earning per share in the range of $2.75 to $2.79. This guidance assumes no deterioration in the U.S. economy, does not consider any future share buybacks, and excludes any impact of the transaction with Shred-it described previously. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mike for more details on the third quarter. Mike Hansen - Vice President and Treasurer : Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned total revenue increased 5.1% from the third quarter of last year with total company organic growth being 3.1%. Total company gross margin for the third quarter was 42.4% which is an improvement from last year\u2019s third quarter gross margin of 41.1%. I\u2019ll discuss these items in more detail by segments Before doing so let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in our third quarter versus 64 workdays in the same quarter of last year. Our fourth quarter will also have 65 workdays whereas last year\u2019s fourth quarter had 66 workdays, so we\u2019ll have one less workday in the fourth quarter. For the full fiscal year we will have 260 workdays which is one less than last year\u2019s total. We have four affordable operating segments, Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services, and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the phase of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the third quarter and totaled $801.7 million which was up 7.1% compared to last year\u2019s third quarter. Organic growth was 5.4%. The weaker Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar impacted our rental segment growth by 0.6 percentage points. We continue to be pleased with the amount of new business generated by our sales representatives. Our rentals segment gross margin was 43.9% for the third quarter, an increase from 41.9% in last year\u2019s third quarter which had one less workday than this year\u2019s third quarter. We continue to see improved leveraging of our fixed costs. We\u2019ve been able to increase revenue without adding additional processing capacity. Also as we have discussed on previous calls we began to increase our route capacity in last year\u2019s second quarter and we\u2019ve now lapped that initial investment. The efficiency of these routes has improved and has helped to increase rentals gross margin. The rental segment\u2019s third quarter gross margin of 33.9% was also an improvement from the 42.9% in the second quarter. Energy-related costs were about 30 basis points higher than the second quarter, but improved route efficiency and fixed cost leverage were more than enough to offset the impact and drive margin improvement. Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the third quarter and totaled $107.7 million. In comparison to the prior year quarter, revenue was 14.6% lower. The nature of this business is that the revenue can be quite choppy based on the timing of large national account program rollouts. As we have discussed on previous calls, we had several very large national account rollouts during the second half of last fiscal year, which will not repeat this year. This prior year activity included the largest customer rollout in company history in the third quarter of last year. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 27.5% for the third quarter, down from last year\u2019s third quarter gross margin of 29.2%. The prior year third quarter margin benefited significantly from the revenue from our largest customer rollout ever. Our first aid, safety and fire protection services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First aid, safety and fire protection revenue which accounted for 11% of company revenue in the third quarter was $126.7 million. This represents an increase of 12.3% over last year\u2019s third quarter revenue. Organic growth was 9.2%. The severe winter weather\u2019s impact on this segment\u2019s growth rate was 1.3 percentage points. The segment\u2019s gross margin was 43.5% in the third quarter compared to 44% in last year\u2019s third quarter. The severe weather negatively impacted margin. Also the margin fluctuates from time-to-time depending upon the mix of products and services provided. The gross margin of 43.5% is slightly better than the second quarter gross margin of 43.4%. Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services and it accounted for 8% of third quarter total company revenue. Document destruction or shredding comprised about 80% of segment revenue for both the third quarter and fiscal year-to-date and about 70% of segment operating income. Please note that we allocate all of our corporate overhead to each segment. At this time, we are not able to quantify the amount of the overhead currently allocated to the document management operating segment that will need to be absorbed by the other operating segments after the closing of the transaction with Shred-it. We will provide more clarity in July when we provide fiscal year 2015 guidance. A gain or loss on the transaction will be recognized in the period in which the transaction is closed, which we expect to occur in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Going forward, our investment in the partnership will be recorded under the equity method of accounting and we will record our share of the partnership\u2019s net income or loss into our earnings. Switching to selling and administrative expenses, SG&A was 29.1% as a percentage of revenue in the third quarter, which was up from last year\u2019s third quarter figure of 28.7%. The change was due to a number of relatively minor items, including payroll tax increases imposed by various states, slightly higher bad debt expense and professional and legal fees related to the document destruction transaction previously mentioned. In the second quarter of this fiscal year, SG&A was 28.3%. The increase in the third quarter is due to the resetting of payroll taxes at the beginning of the calendar year. Our effective tax rate was 36.8% for the quarter compared to 36.1% last year. Last year, our third quarter effective tax rate reflected the favorable impact of a change to certain tax regulations. We had no similar items in this year\u2019s third quarter. We expect the effective tax rate for the full fiscal 2014 year to be 37.3%. Turning now to the balance sheet, our cash and marketable securities were about $354 million at February 28, an increase of $41 million from the $313 million at November 30, despite the $93 million dividend paid within the third quarter. Accounts receivable increased about $9 million since November 30. DSOs were 41 compared to 40 in last year\u2019s third quarter. Total inventory, including new goods inventory and in-service inventory at about $755 million at February 28 was relatively consistent with amounts at November 30. Accrued liabilities at February 28 decreased from the November 30 balance primarily due to the payment in December of our annual dividend. Long-term debt was $1.3 billion comparable to the amount at November 30 And net cash provided by operating activities for the third quarter was about $386 million, an $18 million improvement over last year\u2019s third quarter. CapEx for the third quarter was about $37 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows : $25 million in rental, less than $1 million in Uniform Direct Sales, $3 million in first aid, safety and fire protection, and $8 million in document management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2014 to be in the range of $150 million to $180 million. This concludes our prepared remarks and we will now be glad to answer any of your questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Credit Suisse. Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse : Good afternoon. Thank you. Just a question on the proceeds out of the JV of the document shredding business, I realize you want less exposure to OCC and ONP, but could you give us a sense of what you plan to do with the proceeds? And then also as you look to sell the imaging and storage business, what do you expect out of proceeds for that, maybe uncertain, but just give us a sense do you buyback more stock here? Do you reinvest in the business? Bill Gale : Well, Hamzah I would say, first off the transaction has not closed. So it\u2019s premature to discuss what we are going to do with the proceeds. Secondly, the board will certainly evaluate the utilization of the proceeds in the best way possible, but it\u2019s really no different than what our current position has always been and that we will utilize our cash to grow our businesses by investing in those businesses with capital expenditures as appropriate. We will certainly look for good acquisitions. We are open to acquisitions in any of our businesses if they make economic sense and we have demonstrated that we certainly will be willing to repurchase stock if warranted. I will remind everyone that we purchased over 3 million shares of stock at the beginning of this fiscal year. With regard to your comment on the storage and imaging business, we have not made any decision yet on whether we are going to sell that business or not. We said that, that business will continue to be operated as Cintas\u2019 businesses. We will look at opportunities for value creation, but nothing has been decided at this point. Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse : Okay, thank you. And then maybe if you could give us a sense of how to think about the incremental margins you are currently generating, you mentioned better fixed cost absorption. Just give us a sense of where incremental margins are and where they could go given the current pricing environment, the additions on route capacity and just what you are hearing from your customers? Bill Gale : Well, I would say we have \u2013 I think we have done an outstanding job with our margins in a difficult economic environment over the course of the last couple of years. Again, we are creating much of our growth through new business, which is more costly, but I think with the utilization of our assets, our facilities, our routes have really paid dividends and you have seen the improved margins in the businesses quarter-over-quarter especially within the rental segment and the first aid and safety and fire segments. So where can margins go? Certainly we think that they can continue to improve. We would love to have some opportunity to get some of that from pricing, but pricing remains very competitive as it has been for several years. And so what we\u2019re doing is just making sure we\u2019re running our operations as efficiently as possible utilizing our assets appropriately and we\u2019ve seen some benefits from that. Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse : Okay. Mike Hansen : Keeping in mind Hamzah at the beginning of the year we signaled that there maybe a need for some additional processing capacity and that we\u2019re still evaluating that but that may occur more than likely not this fiscal year but maybe in for the next fiscal year. And so they\u2019re probably will come a time in the near future when some additional capacity is needed. Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. I appreciate it and I\u2019ll turn it over. Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll now go to Sara Gubins from Bank of America. Sara Gubins - Bank of America : Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Could you give us an update on the trends that you saw in the quarter in add-stops? Bill Gale : Add-stops we\u2019re still positive in the quarter, Sara but they were less so than they were in the first and second quarter of this fiscal year or even in comparison to the third quarter last year. However, I will remind everyone that those of you who monitor the jobs reports will also note that jobs added in this most recent quarter were less than they were in the first half of our fiscal year as well as in the third quarter of last year. So we would have anticipated more add-stops if the employment level had increased and yet that did not happen. Sara Gubins - Bank of America : It makes sense. Could you give us an update on trends in different verticals within rentals particularly manufacturing but I\u2019d be interested to get your broader comments as well? Bill Gale : What we\u2019re seeing is of course what we\u2019re seeing is stable workforces among our customers and we\u2019ve been seeing that for sometime, we\u2019ve talked about it. Growth is coming from pretty much our traditional type of rental customers. I would say there is no one segment that really stands out. You mentioned manufacturing, well manufacturing is a segment, a part of the growth, but it\u2019s really the service business that we continue to see which has the bulk of our wares and we continue to see opportunities for new customers in that particular vertical. So I don\u2019t think anything really sticks out at this time, it\u2019s generally just we\u2019re selling more business to customers either no programmers or currently with other competitors that we really follow our traditional type of uniform ware. Sara Gubins - Bank of America : Okay, great. And then just last question. It looks like there wasn\u2019t any share purchasing in the quarter although I know you did quite a bit in the first half, any comments on that and how you are thinking about it for the rest of the year? Bill Gale : Well I think yes keep in mind we bought 3 million share over 3 million shares in the first part of the year but we also were in the midst of this transaction which precluded our ability to be as active in the market as we might have been able to have the transaction not been occurring. Sara Gubins - Bank of America : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll now go to Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: Hi, thank you very much for taking my questions. Hey Bill, who dictated or what dictated the equity split over there? Why would you guys not want to own that business? I understand there is some volatility but just based on the leverage that is possible from a bigger business and also the capacity utilization from your off-site shredding plus the fact that at some point in time the paper prices are going to come back. I would think that the contribution right now is at a point in time in the cycle that it\u2019s probably not necessarily as good of a price as you could have valued the whole equity at in a few years? Bill Gale : Shlomo it really comes down to what\u2019s being contributed by both sides to this venture. So the fact of the matter is that Shred-it is contributing more revenue and more EBITDA than we\u2019re at this point given the relative size of the destruction businesses. We think by retaining our ownership in this thing we see a very good opportunity for value creation by the combination of these two very strong organizations. And we think it is a very appropriate time to do this and we\u2019re very pleased with the establishment of the relationship with Shred-it and the fact that we\u2019re not a majority owner, it does not bother us given our confidence in the combined management teams and businesses of the two companies. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: Just to be clear I think it\u2019s a good deal, I was just hoping you would have done more equity on that deal based on where we are in the thing. I understand you\u2019re saying based on the EBITDA and revenue contribution that\u2019s what you came out with. So, why the $180 million payment, can you give us an insight into that? Bill Gale : That\u2019s primarily driven by the fact that we\u2019re not contributing any debt to the operation, whereas the partnership is going to actually leverage themselves up with debt and in order to maintain the appropriate equity split we received cash at closing as a result of that transaction. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: Okay, I understand. And then do you have any kind of estimate in terms of the weather impact to the overall business in general? Is there some way to quantify that or it just seems to me and when I\u2019m going with this is the Uniform Rentals business I thought did particularly well despite the weather issues. So I\u2019m just trying to figure out how well it really did underline? Bill Gale : Well I think the Uniform Rental business was able to overcome some of the weather issues because many of our locations we have four day \u2013 four days route weeks. So in other words our operations have an extra day if needed to makeup when they have these types of conditions they have to operate in, whereas if you look at our other businesses we don\u2019t have that extra, that flexibility and being able to overcome the loss of revenue on days when operations were required to be shutdown or customers were shutdown. So I think that was one of the main reasons. As far as quantifying it it\u2019s difficult because we looked at it in a number of different ways and I think Mike mentioned it in his comments in the First Aid Safety segment we calculate that we probably have an impact to our growth rate of about 1.5%. I would say we probably saw a similar if not little greater impact in the Document Management business and the Uniform Direct Sale business is very hard to predict. We know we had lower revenue from our catalog business which is sold by our route drivers due to the fact that they\u2019re focusing making sure that could deliver and pickup the rental products and services and probably did not have as much time to spend with their customers and trying to sell products out of the catalog. The Uniform Direct Sale business much of our \u2013 that businesses in the hospitality sector and obviously they experienced some issues associated with the weather, that mean they slowed down some of their buying, I can\u2019t say that for sure, I suspect that might be part of the case. But certainly weather did have an impact but with all that said I really think our people did a great job I mean we \u2013 I thought the results were very well, very good for given those conditions and so I feel very good about it. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: And just one more just to clarify, the accounting on the JV, you guys are going to take the profitability of that business on to the P&L below the operating line? Is that how that\u2019s going to work? Bill Gale : Yes, that\u2019s correct, Shlomo. So just to reiterate what Mike said basically after the transaction is completed there will be the recognition on a quarterly basis of our 42% share of the net income or loss of that JV, of that partnership. Now that partnership\u2019s net income is going to be impacted in the first 12 to 18 months by some one-time cost as they\u2019re attempting to gain the synergies that are going to be very good for this venture. And then we\u2019ll see the benefit of those synergies as \u2013 coming forward as we move through the relationship. Obviously the leverage that will exist on that partnership will also be reflected in their net income, the interest expense. So we\u2019ll be picking that part up in that recognition of the investment in the partnership. But it will be separately reported within the income statement and as you \u2013 you know and just for everybody else\u2019s benefits, we will not be consolidating any of their revenue, it will be strictly an investment line. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: Right. So in terms of the way you\u2019re going to look at the business, you\u2019re going to \u2013 looking at the business absent this investment basically go on a go forward basis, that\u2019s what it sounds like after the sale? Bill Gale : I am sorry I don\u2019t understand your question. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: In other words, on an EPS basis when you guys go ahead and give it, you are going to be talking about the operations of the business that you are actually controlling as opposed to this JV? Bill Gale : There will be an EPS impact from this investment. It will fall into our net income and therefore be part of our EPS. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: And you are going to give us guidance based on that as well, you are going to give us guidance next year? Bill Gale : Well, we are going to give you to the extent we can Shlomo. You got to understand there is a business plan that\u2019s being, going to be developed. We may not have all of the ability to really predict exactly what\u2019s going to happen in the first year or so, but we will give you guidance to the best of our ability in July when we provide our first look at fiscal \u201815. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel: Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Hauke from Robert Baird. Justin Hauke - Robert Baird : Yes, good evening guys. I guess one more question on the transaction. Can you talk about what have any impact on the capital intensity of that business? And I guess the reason why I ask that is you are talking about doing more offsite shredding as opposed to onsite and our understanding has been that, that over the long run that\u2019s less capital intensive, you need less trucks? And I guess the second part of the question would be just in terms of your M&A strategy, the document management has really represented the lion\u2019s share of where you have been focused over the last few years and so now that this is part of the joint venture, I am just wondering is there still the same level of transaction capital that\u2019s needed within that venture from you? Bill Gale : The new partnership will fund its own capital requirements. So, we will not be injecting any capital to that partnership or we don\u2019t anticipate injecting any capital in that partnership to continue to fund their growth. We still are running and operating storage and imaging businesses although that as Mike said, that\u2019s only 20% of that segment. And I have some capital needs although they tend to be more stair step type needs as you fill up a facility then you have to purchase another facility and build the racking appropriately for that. So I would say that the capital expenditures will be lessened by the result of us not funding the document shredding business. On the other hand, as Mike said, we are going to have some capital expenditures needed over the course of next few years for production capacity in our rental business. We also are continuing on our implementation of an ERP system and that will consume some capital needs over the next year and the year after as we start moving into some of our other bigger businesses to put into SAP. Justin Hauke - Robert Baird : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I guess just are you going to continue to at least in the Qs where you have the consolidated contribution of the venture? I mean, are we going to have any more insight other than just the equity income contribution that comes to you, in other words\u2026 Bill Gale : That is yet to be determined, Justin. There is a lot of very complex accounting rules and disclosure rules and we don\u2019t have enough details yet to know exactly what we are going to be required to disclose or not. Justin Hauke - Robert Baird : Okay. And then just the last one just a clarity, so there was no divestiture of any control of your operations to Shred-it. So in other words, I think you said the $180 million cash infusion was just to balance the capital structure of the two ventures coming together as opposed to you divesting any part of it as their direct ownership? Mike Hansen : Right. You keep in mind the $180 million is coming to us and secondly we owning 42% of the new partnership, we will not have control of that partnership. It will be a minority interest. Justin Hauke - Robert Baird : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question will come from Nate Brochmann from William Blair. Nate Brochmann - William Blair : Good evening gentlemen. Bill Gale : Hello. Mike Hansen : Hi, Nate. Nate Brochmann - William Blair : Hey, why didn\u2019t you talk a little bit in terms of just the overall pricing environment, obviously I know that everything kind of remains competitive, but it feels like it\u2019s pretty rationale and stable right now. I was just wondering if you could talk about the pricing environment both in terms of kind of winning new business as well as some of the existing retention stuff? Bill Gale : Well, Nate, I\u2019d say it\u2019s never rationale enough for us. We\u2019d always like more. But with that said, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s improved a lot, but it certainly has been deteriorated. Our ability to win new business was still pretty good and retaining business, our loss business is very, very good and has been so for the last year or so, but it\u2019s still tough. And I would say we are not able to get the kind of prices we like to have, because we have got some very good competitors out there who continue to price aggressively and we have to be able to meet them in the marketplace. Nate Brochmann - William Blair : And are you seeing that more in terms of where you are running up against potential new accounts? Are you seeing that more on the retention side? Bill Gale : When you say more, I think it\u2019s not as bad as it was back in \u201809 and \u201810, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s been pretty steady. We are seeing at both places when a competitor knows that our contract with the customer is up, they are in there wanting that business just like we are in their customers when their contracts are up. And new business, it all depends on how competitive the buyer wants to be if they \u2013 that they want to get multiple bids, then it becomes more aggressive, but on the other hand, they are satisfied that our product offerings are better than what they can get elsewhere and they like the value of the business, which is one of the great things that we think we offer. Then often we can get closer to a book price on those new customers. Nate Brochmann - William Blair : Fair enough. That makes sense. And kind of going back to the weather and the top line impact a little bit, you kind of gave a rough number of where you think that went and you clearly pointed out the overall macro jobs report number. In your kind of feel and talking to your customers, do you feel that there would be a little bit more momentum if it wasn\u2019t for the weather out there in terms of just where the overall job growth is and your opportunity to win some new accounts or do you feel that it\u2019s still sluggish at best? Bill Gale : I think it\u2019s still sluggish. I think the weather created a little bit more sluggishness than otherwise would have happened, but there is not a lot of momentum out there from what we can gather. Nate Brochmann - William Blair : Okay, that\u2019s great. I appreciate it. Thanks guys. Operator : We will now move to George Tong from Piper Jaffray. George Tong - Piper Jaffray : Hi, thanks. You talked earlier about excess capacity investments potentially for next fiscal year, where is your utilization currently and which segments do you think will require the most investment for growth? Bill Gale : Well, it\u2019s very difficult to utilization, George. It\u2019s just, I mean, this is the local business and you got to look at every operation separately and every market separately, but we think the rental segment is 71% of our overall revenues they also are the ones that are going to require the largest amount of capital infusion in order to continue to grow on such a base. I think we have done a really nice job of continuing to utilize the existing capacity, but we are going to come to a point in certain markets and we have already started the process of looking for appropriate land to build the new capacity and that will be coming online over the course of the next couple of years. We always will have truck needs in both the rental business and in the first aid and safety and fire businesses. So that will be required. And then as I mentioned, I don\u2019t want to overlook whether reiterate this, is the SAP ERP implementation looks like it will go forward and therefore it will consume some big capital in order to get that done, but we think the benefits of that are certainly justifying the expenditure in that \u2013 for that system. George Tong - Piper Jaffray : And do you think the next round of capital infusion or investments will be similar to what you did last year in the second quarter? Mike Hansen : Last year in the second quarter was primarily a route-based infusion if you will and we are going to \u2013 we have continued and will continue to add routes periodically as we need them and don\u2019t expect another infusion if you will at any one point in time that is a significant amount from a routing standpoint, but as Bill mentioned there maybe some processing capacity CapEx. George Tong - Piper Jaffray : Got it. Could you comment more on sales rep productivity in your Uniform Rentals business and specifically quantifying how much of the growth this quarter was driven by new business? Mike Hansen : Sales growth continues to be driven by new business; our new business results are still good. We\u2019ve been very pleased with the productivity levels. We\u2019d like to see certainly more customer hiring but we just haven\u2019t seen the momentum in the economy to be able to provide for that. So it\u2019s continued to be driven by new business results. George Tong - Piper Jaffray : Alright. And then lastly you noted a smaller positive add-stop metric this quarter, what assumptions for add-stops are you incorporating into your revised guidance? Bill Gale : Well given the range of guidance it really could be anything from flattish to what we saw in the first half of this year. So it\u2019s not going \u2013 we don\u2019t see a significant change in the add-stops ratio over the course of the next three months. But I think the guidance allows for a variable from flat to a little bit more robust than we saw this quarter. George Tong - Piper Jaffray : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll move to Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Thanks. Good evening guys. With the guidance for fourth quarter and the full year, I\u2019m just curious and we have a little incident that happened in the third quarter with an extra day, but with one less workday in the fourth quarter. Could you give us and help with our models with regard to perhaps top-line and operating income impact there? Thanks. Mike Hansen : I think from a top-line standpoint you can simply take last year\u2019s fourth quarter revenue divided by 66 days and multiply that by 65 days to get your base. From an operating income standpoint Bill and I\u2019ve generally talked about a 50 basis point impact. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Great. Thanks for that. And then fiscal 2015 versus fiscal 2014 now, I think you gave 2014 over 2013 for full year date with \u2013 just allowing the theme, but is there going to be a difference? Mike Hansen : They will be the same. There will be 65 work days in each quarter in fiscal 2015 for a total of 260, the same as to fiscal 2014. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Great, thanks. And then going back to the earlier questions guys obviously a lot of cash coming in, maybe a little you mentioned ERP might take up more CapEx, but probably less from the relationship now with Document Management. So we\u2019ve got into now probably a lot of opportunity for buybacks. But I was just curious I think a lot of the acquisition activity historically has been in Document Management which did certainly leave the door open there. I was hoping to delve in a little deeper as to what type of opportunities you may explore may pursue on the acquisition front? Thanks. Bill Gale : Scott, we\u2019re going to pursue acquisitions in all of our businesses as appropriate. Now we\u2019ve been making acquisitions in the fire business, we made a lot of acquisitions to establish our footprint in first aid. We\u2019ve had some fairly significant uniform acquisitions although nothing significant since 2006, but we\u2019re certainly open to that. Again you have to have a willing seller and you have to have appropriate valuation to make sense. And we will continue to look at those opportunities as they present themselves. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Great. And one final one if I could, obviously in direct sales a year ago, a big national customer would \u2013 want a progress report on how that\u2019s going and how the big customer addition outlook is within that segment? Thank you. Bill Gale : The big customer was the United Airlines Continental merger and that was the one that we were asked to provide all the uniforms for the new combined airline. And I would say it went extremely well, they were very \u2013 they\u2019re very pleased with it. And I think it turned out to be successful for both sides. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Thanks, guys. Thanks very much. Operator : We\u2019ll now go to Dan Dolev from Jefferies. Dan Dolev - Jefferies: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Back to the acquisition, it seems like it\u2019s a fantastic deal. Per my math you\u2019re sacrificing about $10 million of EBITDA getting paid $180 million. I mean back in September you said that you\u2019re still pursuing a lot of Document Management acquisitions. So my question is really what has changed, was it valuation that was so attractive or were there any other bigger strategic decisions to maybe over time completely get rid of this business in the long-term that made you do this? Thanks. Bill Gale : Well we really aren\u2019t getting rid of the business. We still own 42% of a bigger entity. So I don\u2019t think you should assume that there was \u2013 that was involved in this. I think it\u2019s an opportunity to join two very good companies that will focus totally on document destruction and I think you\u2019re going to see value creation as a result of those two entities coming together run by very good management teams and we\u2019re going to share in that upside as well as having getting $180 million upfront on this thing? Mike Hansen : Yes, Dan, one of the reasons we talked about really liking these small document shredding acquisitions over time. And this is very much like a large one where we have a lot of opportunities to put more volume into our plant-based shredding facilities to get efficiencies, to drive on to one IT platform. And we\u2019ve got a lot of opportunities here that it takes a long time to accumulate many small acquisitions in order to get the synergies created by this deal. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re so excited about this deal. Dan Dolev - Jefferies: Got it. Did it make more sense than just buying Shred-it? Bill Gale : No, I don\u2019t think Shred-it was necessarily for sale and they were bigger than we were. And I think that the combination of the two made more sense to our Board and to the management team than any other opportunity that was available. Dan Dolev - Jefferies: Got it. Bigger you mean on a shredding size not on an overall size? Bill Gale : Right. But that\u2019s what this is focused on is the shredding side only. Dan Dolev - Jefferies: Got it. Well thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question will come from Joe Box from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sean Egan - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Hi guys. This is Sean Egan in for Joe Box. I just have a quick question. I wanted to go back to the pricing environment you spoke of earlier. When you mentioned that pricing pressures were kind of creating an environment that wasn\u2019t where you would like it to be, we\u2019re hearing from our contacts that they\u2019re getting quite a bit of pushback from a lot of their customers due to Affordable Care Act implications on their budgets. And they\u2019re really sharpening their pencil and pushing back on their vendors and I\u2019m curious to know how much of that pricing pressure are you seeing from competitive or new competitors versus an existing client coming back to you and pushing back? Bill Gale : Sean I really don\u2019t have the knowledge to really comment on that. Again we\u2019ve got thousands and thousands of customers and locations. I\u2019m sure there were some examples that exist of what you said. But for me to really say that that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing, I really don\u2019t know. Sean Egan - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Okay, great. And then just a housekeeping item following up, regarding the transaction, are there any anticipated charges such as any write-downs associated with the deal possibly by the end of the fiscal year? Bill Gale : All that should \u2013 there certainly are those things that could happen. As we said its very complex, accounting and tax transaction, all that will be a part of what a gain or loss gets recognized as we move forward on the deal. So I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not in a position at this time to be able to tell you what that is because there was a lot of work yet to be done on valuations and really looking at the details of the deal. And we will certainly provide color on that as we report our fourth quarter results in July. We do not anticipate providing any further guidance on that at this time. We will discuss it so with the fourth quarter. Sean Egan - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Okay, great. That\u2019s all from me. Thank you. Operator : (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll now go to Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Manav Patnaik - Barclays: Hey, good evening gentlemen. Just one question around the thought process with document management, I mean clearly Shred-it was purely shredding, you guys obviously kept shredding in the document management together. Just some can you just remind us sort of what the strategy there was and why that got left behind? Bill Gale : Well, the original strategy years and years ago, Manav, was that we first got into document destruction, the document shredding. And then we wanted to \u2013 we had some opportunities to pickup some storage business and we thought that, that might be required in order to appropriately grow the shredding business. We have been happy with some of the storage businesses that we have purchased. And as we have studied this industry, you really don\u2019t have to have both of them in all the markets in order to grow either one of them. So it became apparent to us and we started saying this a few years ago that we were going to focus more on the destruction side and we were just opportunistically going to look for places in which to grow the storage business, but not in a big way. Shred-it, on the other hand, has a very, very small storage business in Canada. They have focused primarily almost exclusively on the destruction side. And really it doesn\u2019t make sense to throw our storage and imaging business into this deal, because the whole concept here is to focus on document destruction. And so that\u2019s how this whole thing is transpired. Manav Patnaik - Barclays: Okay, fair enough. And then just a quick point on the M&A pipeline, clearly you guys have slowed down the pace of the small M&A that you guys have done across the board. You mentioned obviously, I sort of understand that landscape in the uniform rental space, but can you help us understand the number of smaller players or midsize larger in the fire, safety area because I guess that\u2019s the other area that you had been active? Bill Gale : Yes. And we are still active, there are a lot of players in the fire business that we are in discussions with, but again it comes down to an expectation on the part of the seller versus what we are willing to pay in order to get the appropriate valuation for our shareholders. So there have been some small acquisitions and will continue to be. They will pick up when the meeting of the minds get closer together. Manav Patnaik - Barclays: Okay, alright. That\u2019s helpful then. Thank you, guys. Operator : And it appears there are no further questions. I will turn the conference back over to you Mr. Gale for any additional or closing remarks. Bill Gale - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer : Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us tonight. I also wanted to thank you for moving it back like we moved back a day and being able to participate tonight. We are sorry for that bit of confusion, but a lot of that revolved around the timing of this acquisition, I mean this transaction I am sorry and so we appreciate that. We are very excited about forming this partnership with Shred-it. We think it\u2019s great for the shareholders, for our customers and for our partners and we will look forward to talking to you more about it in our fourth quarter earnings release, which should occur sometime in mid-July. Good night. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s presentation. Thank you for your participation.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Bill Gale : Thank you. Thank you for joining us this evening. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter results, which include the effects of the April 30th closing of the partnership transaction with Shred-it International. In addition, we will provide our initial guidance for fiscal 2015. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.  We are pleased to report fourth quarter revenue of $1.157 billion. Keep in mind that this total does not include any shredding revenue for the month of May due to the closing of the shredding transaction on April 30th. Excluding document shredding revenue, our fourth quarter revenue grew 4.7% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Last year\u2019s fourth quarter had one more work day than this year. When adjusting for the impact of the difference in workdays, revenue, excluding document shredding grew 6.3% and it grew organically by 6.1%. As Scott Farmer stated in our press release, after a difficult winter, we were pleased to see our growth rate improve in both our rental and First Aid, Safety and Fire segments. Excluding document shredding related amounts, our fourth quarter operating income was $165.4 million, which was 15% of revenue. This represents an 80 basis point improvement over last year\u2019s fourth quarter operating margin for the same businesses. Our rental operating margin improved 140 basis points over last year\u2019s fourth quarter operating margin despite having one less work day. We continue to see improvements in both plant and route efficiency as we add more volume.  Fourth quarter net income was $127.2 million and earnings per diluted share were $1.03. However, excluding the effects of the shredding transaction, our net income was $94.3 million and earnings per diluted share were $0.76. These fourth quarter results bring to a close a very successful fiscal year for Cintas. Our Rental segment and First Aid, Safety and Fire segment in particular had record years. Our Rental segment achieved record annual revenue of $3.2 billion and it topped $500 million in operating income for the first time, finishing at $507 million. The rental operating income of $507 million was 15.7% of revenue, which was an 80 basis point improvement over last year\u2019s operating margin of 14.9%. Our First Aid, Safety and Fire segment revenue for the year was a record annual level of $514 million topping $500 million for the first time. Operating income was also a record $49 million, thanks to our employees who we call partners for a great year. I will now turn the call over to Mike for more details of the fourth quarter and the effects of the shredding transaction and then I will provide a few comments on our fiscal 2015 guidance. Mike Hansen : Thanks Bill and good evening. I will start with a reminder on workdays. There were 65 workdays in this year\u2019s fourth quarter versus 66 workdays in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Looking ahead to fiscal \u201815, we will have 65 workdays in each quarter for a total of 260 workdays for the fiscal year. These workday figures for fiscal \u201815 are the exact same as in fiscal \u201914. So we will have no workday differences or adjustments for the next four quarters. We have four reportable operating segments; Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of our income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products\u2019 operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue was $825 million, which is up 5.1% compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter. However taking into account the one less workday this year, revenue grew 6.7% over last year. Organic growth was also 6.7%. The Canadian dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar remained weaker than last year during our fourth quarter and it negatively impacted our rental growth rate by 0.6 percentage points. Adjusting for this impact, rental organic growth would have been 7.3%. As it has done for the last several years, new business continues to be the main driver of revenue growth. Net [add/stops] [ph] were negative for the quarter which is typical for our fourth quarter due to seasonal changes, but were slightly better than last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Within the rental segment revenue and based on fourth quarter performance, Uniform Rental accounted for 52% of the total; dust control, which is mainly entrance mats accounted for 19%; hygiene and other services which is restroom supply, cleaning services and chemical services was 16%; shop towel revenue was 5%, and linen and other, which is mainly non-person specific garments such as aprons and butcher coats was 8%. Our Rental segment gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter, an increase from 42.1% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter, which had one additional workday than this year\u2019s fourth quarter. Our incremental gross margin has remained strong as we have been able to increase revenue without adding additional processing capacity. Our route efficiency continues to improve as well since adding route capacity in mid fiscal \u201813. Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue for the fourth quarter was $118.5 million, which was 5% lower than last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Last year\u2019s fourth quarter included large national account roll outs which did not repeat this year. The fourth quarter revenue of $118.5 million was higher than this year\u2019s third quarter revenue of $107.7 million. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 30% for the quarter, down from last year\u2019s fourth quarter gross margin of 30.8%, mainly due to the lower volumes this year. Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue for the fourth quarter was $137.2 million. When adjusting for the workday differential, this revenue level represents an increase of 11.1% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter revenue. Organic growth was 10.2%. We have seen good adoption by our customers of our new First Aid and Safety Products and Services and our First Aid national account sales have been strong. This segment\u2019s gross margin was 44.6% in the fourth quarter, compared to 43.5% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Energy-related costs were consistent with last year. The gross margin improvement was due in part to improved mix, for example, higher training sales on the First Aid side and good leveraging of our infrastructure. Let\u2019s move to a discussion of Document Management Services. This segment has included document destruction or shredding and document storage and imaging services. We provided the document storage and imaging services revenue and operating income for the fourth quarter in today\u2019s press release. We were pleased with the business\u2019 performance. Fourth quarter revenue was $23.1 million and growth over the last year exceeded 20%. Organic growth was 15.4%. Our European business has had good momentum during the fiscal year and it continued during our fourth quarter. Our Document Shredding revenue for the fourth quarter was $53.7 million. This amount reflects only March and April revenue. Beginning with the months of May and into the future, we will no longer include Shredding revenue in our reported revenue since we are accounting for the partnership investment under the equity method of accounting. The closing of the Shred-it transaction resulted in the recognition of a gain due to the fair value of our share of the Shred-it partnership being greater than the book value of our investment in the business. Keep in mind that the book value of our investment was recorded throughout our balance sheet, including accounts receivable, property and equipment, goodwill, service contracts, and other assets offset by certain liabilities contributed to the partnership. The net effect of this transaction in the fourth quarter was $32.9 million in net income and $0.27 to EPS. The investment in Shred-it partnership is recorded within the balance sheet line item entitled investments. Going forward, we will record our 42% share of the partnership income within our SG&A line on the income statement. We continue to be excited about the partnership with Shred-it. As we discussed on our call in March, we believe the combination of our Document Shredding business with Shred-it will create opportunities for synergies that will benefit our customers, our shredding employees and our shareholders. Having said that, in order to realize the synergies, the partnership will incur costs to transition IT platforms, to convert the operations and the trucks to the Shred-it name, to consolidate certain administrative functions et cetera. We expect the bulk of these transition expenses to be incurred in our fiscal \u201915 year. As a result, we do not expect the partnership to contribute any income to Cintas in fiscal 2015. Instead, we expect to begin realizing synergies and income in our fiscal year 2016. Switching to selling and administrative expenses, SG&A was 28.2% as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter, which was up from last year\u2019s fourth quarter figure of 27.8%, due to a number of different items including workers comp claims experience, legal and professional expenses, and slight higher bad debt expense. The fourth quarter SG&A of 28.2% was lower than the third quarter percentage of 29.1%. Payroll taxes reset our third quarter and we generally see a reduction from the third to the fourth quarter as a percent of revenue. Medical expenses were also slightly lower than the third quarter. Our effective tax rate was 40.5% for the quarter compared to 37.4% last year. This year\u2019s fourth quarter rate included a number of discrete items related to the Shred-it transaction. Excluding the effects of the transaction, the fourth quarter effective rate was roughly 37.1%. We expect the fiscal \u201915 effective rate to be 37.3%. Turning now to the balance sheet, our cash and marketable securities were about $513 million at May 31, an increase of $159 million from the $354 million at February 28, mainly due to strong operating cash flow. Although we received $180 million of cash on April 30, at the closing of the Shred-it transaction, we used $206 million during the quarter for the share buyback program. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, our investment in the shredding business was reflected in the balance sheet in a number of different items. When comparing our May 31st balance sheet to the February 28th balance sheet, you will notice decreases to accounts receivable, property and equipment, goodwill, service contracts and other assets due to the contribution of the shredding assets to the partnership. These balances have been replaced within an investment balance of roughly $340 million that is combined with other investments in the balance sheet line items entitled investments. Long-term debt remained at $1.3 billion, representing roughly 1.6 times fiscal 2014 EBITDA. Net cash provided by operating activities for the fourth quarter was about $222 million, a $38 million improvement over last year\u2019s fourth quarter. And finally CapEx for the fourth quarter was about $32 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows : $23 million in rental, less than $1 million in Uniform Direct Sales, $4 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire protection, and $4 million in document management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of $275 million to $325 million. This range is higher than the last few years because we expect to embark on the SAP implementation for our rental business and expect to add some rental processing capacity during the year. I will now turn the call back to Bill for comments on our fiscal 2015 guidance. Bill Gale : Thanks Mike. Our fiscal 2015 guidance is for revenue to be in the range of $4.425 billion to $4.525 billion and earnings per diluted share to be in the range $3.06 to $3.15. Let me provide some color to this guidance. We have explained that we will not include document shredding revenue in our fiscal 2015 reported revenue. However due to accounting requirements we still need to include the document shredding revenue in our fiscal 2014 reported revenue. This means reported growth rate will look artificially low. In our press release though we provided the table that shows fiscal 2014 base revenue without document shredding of $4.276 billion. This fiscal 2014 base revenue provides a better comparison to fiscal 2015 guidance. As Scott Farmer indicated in our press release today, while the U.S. employment picture has improved this calendar year, it is a relatively narrow improvement. One third quarter of the new jobs this year are in areas not typically strong in uniform rental, foodservice, professional services, temporary workers in education. We set our revenue guidance with this employment narrowness and the largely inconsistent U.S. economic performance in mind. From an EPS perspective as we reported today, our EPS for fiscal 2014 was $3.05. This figure included the net impact of the Shred-it transaction of $0.26. It also included a $0.04 benefit net of tax from the operating income of the document shredding business in fiscal 2014. As Mike just mentioned though, we do not expect any benefit in fiscal 2015 from the shredding partnership. When excluding these two amounts, our fiscal 2014 EPS would have been $2.75 and we believe this provides a better comparison to our fiscal 2015 expected results. Our fiscal 2015 EPS guidance does include and $0.11 benefit from the sale of stock of an equity method investment that occurred a few weeks ago on June 30th. It also includes the $0.09 benefit from the share buybacks that occurred between April and June of this year. The EPS guidance does not assume any additional share buybacks for the remainder of fiscal year \u201915. As I just indicated a few minutes ago, we remain unconvinced that the U.S. economy will become consistent. In addition, as a result of the contribution of our document shredding business to the Shred-it partnership, we have less revenue that contributes to covering our SG&A structure. We will continue to control cost as we have always done but we also need to grow back into some of our SG&A infrastructure. We set our EPS guidance with those items in mind. That concludes our prepared remarks and we will now be glad to answer your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Could you tell us some more about the rental capacity that you are adding for the year? I think you\u2019d talked before about adding some more processing capacity? Bill Gale : Yes, Sara, and we did speak about this in a few other calls, and it was initially our expectation that we would have added some of this capacity in fiscal \u201914, but we did not. What we are adding basically is processing capacity in the form of new facilities, especially because of rapid growth that we\u2019ve had in certain markets and some of those plants will be relatively expensive. For example, we will be adding a new plant in the New York Metro area and as anybody who lives in New York knows, land up there and construction cost et cetera are relatively expensive. So we have several plants that we will be adding. Some of them will come online maybe toward the latter part of this year. Others will not come online until next year, but they will -- a lot of that capital will be spent in fiscal \u201915. Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And then if you could give an update on add/stops and pricing trends? Mike Hansen : As I had mentioned a little earlier, add/stops were negative for the quarter, which is not unusual given changes being made due to the change in weather, a little bit better than last year, but I would say not -- we\u2019re not seeing much impact from the employment which seems to be a good headline but as Bill mentioned, it\u2019s fairly narrow. So net add/stops, little bit better than last year, negative for the quarter. Pricing seems to be a little bit better. I would say it\u2019s driven within our new business but generally we saw a little bit better pricing environment this quarter than maybe a year ago. Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  And then just last question, you mentioned the SAP implementation for the rental business. Could you tell us some more about that and whether or not there are any concerns that that might be disruptive during the year? Thank you. Bill Gale : Well, I don\u2019t think it will be disruptive. Let me answer that, because we will do it in phases and the first phase is what they call a blueprint or it\u2019s a design phase and it really doesn\u2019t have any impact on our operations at all but we have to dedicate a lot of resources and capital toward the implementation of this project and the design to determine what we need to do with the software and how they implement it. So we will get through that and then assuming that that is successful, which we expect it to be, then we will start into some more of the detailed programming requirements, data development et cetera that will be needed to run the system. This will be a multi-year implementation. We would not start actually impacting our locations or our customers for some time and hopefully we will be well prepared to handle that. I can assure you we are very careful on these type of projects. But I think it\u2019s important for all of our investors and analysts to understand that any Company that does embark upon these type of projects, it is a large expenditure, it takes a lot of time and effort to put it in and yet when it is successful and we certainly think at this point it will be, it will provide benefits into the future. And they don\u2019t come right away but they certainly provide opportunities to more efficiently run our business, handle our customers\u2019 needs et cetera. Mike Hansen : And the good news is we have just recently, as you have heard us say on prior calls, we have recently finished the roll-out of our First Aid, Safety and Fire business onto the SAP platform. Operator :  And we will take our next question from Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse. Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse : Could you give us an update on customer penetration specifically? How many of your customers subscribe to more than one service or several services and has that number changed over the last few quarters? How should we think about where you are in that process? Bill Gale : Hamzah, I would say we have made some minimal progress in that arena, certainly not to the extent we expect to have. One of the problems that we have with doing that is the multiple types of computer systems we are on. So that\u2019s one of the reasons why we are willing to invest in the SAP system across the entire portfolio of businesses. So, yes we certainly do continue to see some additional penetration but nothing to the extent that we ultimately expect it to be. Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse :  And then maybe just your commentary around growing into your SG&A infrastructure. Do you need cyclical growth for that or how do we think about your comments there and SG&A trends going forward? Bill Gale : Well, I think what we need is revenue growth that we certainly expect to have in order to replace roughly $300 million of revenue that we no longer have from the shredding business, now that it\u2019s part of the joint venture. So you can think about it in this way. You\u2019ve got certain fixed costs that really don\u2019t go away when you basically don\u2019t have that revenue to cover that anymore. For example, we still have an audit fee that costs just as much now as it did when we had document shredding. We still have certain G&A functions that you just can\u2019t cut out parts of because you no longer have the shredding business. So this goes through the entire organization and while we certainly have reduced staff in certain areas where there is the ability to have a variable level of expenditures associated with revenue, there\u2019s a lot of areas where that just won\u2019t take place. So, our expectation is that during the course of the next year, we will essentially grow into that SG&A level and then once we reach fiscal \u201816, not only will we have covered that, the reduction in the shredding revenue, but we expect to start seeing some contribution on the bottom-line from the Shred-it joint venture. Operator :  And we will take our next question from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets :  I think it\u2019s been a while since you guys have actually added some plant capacity. So can you maybe just kind of walk us through the process of how that works? Do you typically operate two separate plants or do you wait for a lease to expire and then you consolidate the two? Bill Gale : Well, what we\u2019re talking about, Joe is primarily the building of an additional plant in markets where we already have plants. So we are not replacing a plant. We\u2019re actually adding a plant. The last time I think we opened a new rental plant was back in fiscal 2008 and then of course we have the great recession and therefore we actually closed a few of our facilities, especially those that had been acquired through an acquisition. So the prior, and by the way we generally own our plants Joe. It\u2019s not a leased facility. We lease our branches or some of our First Aid and Safety operations, but our rental plant because of the extent of the infrastructure within that plant for water treatment, sortations, et cetera, we generally own those facilities. But the idea is, is that we grow so much in a market that we are forced to build another plant to handle the additional volume, and that\u2019s the case here, that we basically have exhausted our ability to squeeze much more out of the existing plants we have and therefore we have to add another one. Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Understood, I get that you guys are already in the market and you\u2019ve run out of capacity there and you have to build a new one. I guess ultimately what I\u2019m trying to understand is how we should think about the margin headwinds from adding an additional plant? Bill Gale : It depends on, it\u2019s so variable depending upon the cost of what that plant will take and then how many other plants are in that market and as you move volume around you know, generally you\u2019ll start the new plant with a said amount of volume, certainly not your capacity but you\u2019ll also have released some of the capacity constraints in some of the other plants. So Dan, I can\u2019t really answer your question because it\u2019s going to be different if it\u2019s in a New York area versus a Cincinnati, Ohio area. Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Okay, that\u2019s fine and I can certainly circle up to you guys offline on some other questions but one other quick follow up. I know you guys don\u2019t provide guidance by segment, but can you maybe give us a feel for how we should be thinking about rental margins in FY\u201915? Clearly a strong finish to the year. And are you assuming a lot more leverage to the plant in the first half then maybe when some of these plants start to come online we could be thinking about a little bit less leverage? Any cadence would be helpful. Bill Gale : I would say our expectations are that margins, barring any significant cost change which we don\u2019t anticipate should be as good as they were this year but I think you make a good point. They\u2019ll probably be a bit stronger in the first half of the year than the second half of the year depending on how this additional capacity comes online. But when you look at it in total for the year, our expectation is we\u2019ll be good as if not slightly better than this year. Operator : And we\u2019ll hear next with George Tong with Piper Jaffray. George Tong - Piper Jaffray : Going back to add/stops, can you give some color on how add/stops are trending so far in the first fiscal quarter and whether directionally we\u2019re seeing continued improvement? Bill Gale : You know George, we\u2019re so early that I would say we haven\u2019t seen much of a change from the fourth quarter. George Tong - Piper Jaffray : And touching on your comment earlier of the need to grow back into SG&A infrastructure, have you made all the necessary variable cost reductions you need or do you see opportunity for additional cost cuts in fiscal \u201915? Bill Gale : I\u2019d say that there was -- some of it has lapsed into \u201915 because you just continue -- the transaction took place on April 30th. So there\u2019ll be a little bit of cost reduction as we move into early \u201915 but it won\u2019t be substantial. George Tong - Piper Jaffray : And then lastly, could you share some commentary on how do you expect Shred-it to contribute to Cintas beyond fiscal 2015, reflecting any synergies to growth in margins you\u2019re expecting from the JV? Bill Gale : Well, we certainly expect synergies. We\u2019re not prepared at this time to quantify them. I think there\u2019s a lot of work being done on the part of the two organizations that have come together. They certainly are optimistic of being able to achieve more than what the two companies were doing separately, when you add them together. So I think as we get closer to \u201916, FY\u201916, we\u2019ll have clarity and we\u2019ll certainly be able to provide that when we give guidance for FY\u201916 a year from now. Operator : We\u2019ll hear next from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer : I\u2019m curious, with SAP, you mentioned its multiyear and obviously a big step up in CapEx. I know you\u2019re probably not in a position to give guidance beyond fiscal \u201915. But directionally do you think that might come back in \u201916 or you think this is going to be a multiyear elevation? Bill Gale : You talking about the CapEx expenditures? Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer : Yes. Bill Gale : I would say the first two years are going to be relatively capital intensive and then they will -- it should fall dramatically after that. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer : And any OpEx impact from the implementation? Bill Gale : I hope not too much. If our experience is similar to what we saw with First Aid, we see a little tick up during the conversion of the operations and shortly thereafter in some of the SG&A or in the G&A expenditures and then over time the benefits start being realized. So it\u2019s, again it\u2019s too early to really tell. We don\u2019t know to the extent of how it\u2019s really going to impact the day-to-day operation itself and until we get through the design phase and start some of the pilot implementations, it\u2019s hard for us to be able to predict that. All we know is that right now, at least going into this, we feel very positive that this is a good use of capital in that the long term return will be very beneficial to the Company. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer : And kind of on a similar vein, now with this partnership with Shred-it closed, what are the M&A thoughts with regard to the core Cintas business? And just kind of a derivative of that, do you see any further involvement? I\u2019m assuming this is no but any further involvement with infusions to the JV -- is that something that\u2019s been discussed? Bill Gale : We would not expect any infusions into the JV. So we believe that they will be able to generate sufficient cash on their own in order to continue to grow and do what they need to do. With regards to Cintas core business, yes, we are very interested in making acquisitions as long as they achieve the financial and strategic objectives that we\u2019ve set out. And that includes acquisitions within the Uniform business, the Facility Services business, First Aid, Fire and potentially some new businesses. So we\u2019ve got an active corporate development group. We\u2019ve got a lot of cash and a great amount of debt capacity and we are certainly going to look for opportunities to grow the Company. Operator : And we\u2019ll hear next from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan: I wanted to ask about rental gross margin and the effect of merchandised amortization in end of quarter, and are we at a point where we have to infuse more garments into service that might weigh on gross margins going forward? Bill Gale : During the quarter Andrew we did not see any change in the trend. So I would say we\u2019ve not hit a point where we need to infuse garments. We still have stock rooms that have a lot of capacity, that have a lot of uniforms in them. And we\u2019re using them very efficiently. So I would say I wouldn\u2019t expect to see a significant change in the injection rate. Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan: Good. And would you expect rental gross margins to be up for fiscal 2015? Bill Gale : Well, as I mentioned earlier to a question Andrew, we would expect there to be a slight improvement in that. It will most likely happen early in the year and then is dependent on the time of when the additional capacity comes online. It may come down a bit. But overall for the year they should be up versus fiscal \u201914. Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan: Right. Bill, I was actually little confused by the comment before. So when you said margins should be up for fiscal 2015, you meant total operating margins or did you mean just rental? Bill Gale : I\u2019m talking specifically about rental because that was what the question was posed. Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan: Sure. So, could you just comment, in the guidance what\u2019s implied in total operating margin for fiscal \u201915? Bill Gale : We don\u2019t break it down like that Andrew but if you look at the growth rates in the top line, they\u2019re a little less that the growth rates in EPS and therefore I would tell you that there has got to be a little bit of margin expansion. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Nate Brochmann with William Blair & Company. Nate Brochmann - William Blair : Just wanted to talk a little bit, you guys have done a really outstanding job of going after and getting some new business from non-programmers as well as kind of penetration with some additional services throughout the organization. Could you talk about like the ability to kind of keep that churning? Obviously I know the market is pretty big out there in terms of the potential, but in terms of whether than has been over the last couple of years, some like low hanging fruit and opportunities or whether it\u2019s something that you\u2019ve done differently, I know that we\u2019ve injected a few more sales people here give or take a year ago to get after that. Could you just talk about in terms of the pipeline and the opportunity in terms of how to keep that going? Bill Gale : I think it\u2019s very similar. Our expectation, it will continue that way for the next several years. We still have a very large sales force. Our mix of new business continues to be more heavily weighted toward the no-programmer side versus the programmer side. Therefore, we continue to see the market self-expanding. We are looking always for new products to help attract other types of no-programmers and we\u2019ve had several of those things roll out in the last year or two. So right now I would say I feel very good about our ability to continue to sell a lot of new business with the bulk of it coming from no-programmers. Nate Brochmann - William Blair : And Bill do you think, and I know this might be hard to answer, so I kind of get it. But do you think that anything has changed fundamentally in terms of the percentage of non-programmers that are converting over to a uniform program or is it that\u2019s there is just more overall businesses out there to go after? So maybe not necessarily the percentage of programmers versus not has changed or do think that the -- that the share of the pie is increasing in terms of the conversion? Bill Gale : I think the share of the pie is increasing because there are more products that we have that enable us to go after certain types of businesses that maybe in the past we never would have gone after. Nate Brochmann - William Blair : Okay. So, I think that\u2019s an interesting point in terms of why it might be a little bit better that it was in the past in terms of the conversion rate? Bill Gale : The conversion rate, though I just want to make sure, the conversion rate has not changed that dramatically since I\u2019ve been with the Company other than during the recession. So I just think that we\u2019ve gotten a lot bigger. We\u2019re $3.2 billion now in the rental division and yet I still think we feel like there is just tremendous opportunities out there, because in the past maybe there was a limited number of businesses that we would have gone after, but now given our wide spectrum of different types of garments, different type of facility services products and services, there is more types of businesses we can go for. Nate Brochmann - William Blair : Okay, that makes sense. And then specifically within the Fire and Safety opportunity, are you guys pretty much everywhere you want to be at this point. And is further growth at this point just continue to build off of the locations you have and scaling that in terms of continue to increase profitability there or are there more locations and more sales people to go in terms of relative investment? Bill Gale : There are -- certainly within the Fire business, we are not nearly to the point of being everywhere we want to be. So there are many, many, cities that we believe we still need a presence in and we would like to make acquisitions and to get into city. Short of that we certainly feel that if it\u2019s important enough we will start Greenfield in those cities. Therefore, I would say the geographic expansion is primarily within the fire business. As far as the uniform rental and the first aid businesses, we\u2019re by and large in most of the largest metropolitan areas, but that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s not acquisition opportunity. So tuck-ins are opportunities and relatively profitable and therefore we will continue to go after those too. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird. Justin Hauke - Robert W. Baird: Yes. So what\u2019s the rationale for running the joint venture income through SG&A as opposed to just adding a separate equity income contribution? I\u2019m just, I\u2019m trying to understand, are we going to be able to have any visibility into performance of the joint venture from here? Bill Gale : Justin for the first year as we\u2019ve said, we don\u2019t expect any contribution from it anyway. So it\u2019s going to be so small that it\u2019s really not worth reporting out into a separate line. Starting in fiscal \u201916, if we feel like the contribution is something that is significant, we\u2019ll pull it out and put it into a separate line. Justin Hauke - Robert W. Baird: Okay. But for right now we should just basically think it as like a negative offset to your SG&A? Bill Gale : Well, you should think of it for fiscal \u201815 as kind of a zero. Justin Hauke - Robert W. Baird: Right. But going forward in \u201816 in terms of thinking about it? Bill Gale : Yes. Justin Hauke - Robert W. Baird: Okay. Just one clarification. On the guidance, I know you said that \u201815 includes the $0.09 contribution from share repurchases in the fourth quarter and so far in the first. And then there was $0.11 benefit as well, that you mentioned. What was that? Bill Gale : That was a gain on the sale of an equity investment that we had, that was closed on June 30th. Justin Hauke - Robert W. Baird: So if you net those two out \u2013 I\u2019m just trying to reconcile that with your comments that you\u2019re expecting margins to be up next year. Because if you kind of take both of those out, it looks like the EPS and the revenue growth are about the same? Bill Gale : It depends what base you start at Justin, but, again Mike tried to -- we tried to share with you that you got to back out of fiscal \u201814 some things like the shredding contribution et cetera and all the transaction costs. But then you take that and you take out the -- go to the top end of the guidance knock out the two items, the share buyback impact and the investment gain, I think you\u2019ll find that there will be a larger increase in EPS than there would be in the top end of the revenue guidance. Justin Hauke - Robert W. Baird: I guess my last one is just on healthcare, I know that was a concern for \u201914 and it sounded like your healthcare expense on a dollar basis is actually lower year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Is there any additional healthcare impact that we should be assuming in \u201815 or is that the -- the impact\u2019s mostly gone through at this point and it\u2019s more or less a flat assumption going forward? Bill Gale : First off, our medical expenses were about the same year-over-year. So I don\u2019t know where you might have gotten less then. Regarding our expectations, who knows? I really \u2013 I\u2019m having difficulty predicting it, because the rules keep changing. There is just too many uncertainties. So right now, I think we\u2019re surprised that it did not go up more dramatically in \u201814 versus the prior year. Next year I would say if I were a betting man, I would think it would go a up a little bit, but I hope it won\u2019t be more than a little bit, because again until we get clarification from the healthcare providers and from the government, it\u2019s hard to predict. Operator : And we will take our next question from Dan Dolev with Jefferies. Dan Dolev - Jefferies: When I look at your guidance, your top-line guidance this year, excluding shredding, so 3.5% to 5.8%, I would say it\u2019s like 1 point lighter than similar guidance that was given in July of last year through this year. Where is the slower growth coming from? Is it shredding or is there someone else, something else? Bill Gale : Well, shredding was certainly a big contributor. Even though it wasn\u2019t -- it was like less than 10% of the revenue, it still was a rapid grower. But to answer the guidance, Mike and I anticipated that there would be some questions on this. And I think it\u2019s important for everyone to understand that first off, there is a lot of inconsistency in this job growth and the economy and therefore we are trying to take that into consideration. We don\u2019t foresee there being any big catalyst to really getting things going. And I would tell you that we tend to be conservative, especially at the beginning of a fiscal year. I would rather make sure that the expectations -- that we can meet expectations. So we tend to be on the conservative side. Therefore I hope that as we go through the year, if we see growth better than what we are currently giving you in the guidance, we will certainly adjust the guidance upward as we go through the year. Dan Dolev -Jefferies: Thanks. And is that conservatism also reflected in your commentary about not expecting any EPS benefit from shredding this year. Bill Gale : That one is a real tough one to say. They\u2019ve got a lot of things they have to go through and changing an IP platform and rebranding the trucks and everything else. I think it\u2019s too early for me to say that that\u2019s conservative or not. I would say right now, I think our expectation of no contribution is maybe realistic. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question with Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicolaus. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus : I just have a few housekeeping type questions in general. The SG&A from the shredding that you said to expect as zero. That\u2019s from a total year perspective though, right? I mean if there is going to be a lot of investments to go after the synergies, I would expect that at least for part of the year that you would have some -- to the extent that there is some losses, that might be reflected and you guys have called that out for us, is that the right way to think of it? Bill Gale : Yes, I think if we saw -- so for example, we may see because of the timing of some of these transitional expenses, we may see some ups and downs from quarter-to-quarter and we would likely point those out to you, yes. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus :  Okay. And then the SAP system, I know you guys went through -- in the fiscal year \u201810 timeframe there was a roll out of SAP and you guys had built up some inventory in advance of that. What was that for and how many other parts of the business are there left to roll this system out to? Bill Gale : We started the SAP -- the first thing we did were our financial systems and that was done several years ago. That was back in probably the \u201909 timeframe. Very successful and that was phase one. Phase two was we took our global supply chain, essentially the manufacturing, the ordering of garments and other products, we put that on SAP. That\u2019s where the buildup of inventory was, in anticipation of converting the vet system and we didn\u2019t want any disruption. Then we embarked upon the SAP implementation at our First Aid and Safety and Document Shredding operations, and that just concluded just at the end of this past fiscal year. So now we are moving forward into the rental business and then yet to be done would be the Direct Sale business and the Fire business. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus : Okay, great. And then in terms of the document storage, that\u2019s such a tiny part of that business. Does it make sense to think about that as an ongoing business for you guys? Bill Gale : At this time, yes. As we mentioned in March, we are evaluating strategic options for that business. We had a very nice fourth quarter. We are very encouraged by the growth rate. But we will continue to evaluate alternatives and if and when we should decide to something differently other than to continue to operate them, we will certainly let everyone know. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus : Are they concentrated in particular geographies for? Bill Gale : Primarily, they are located in the Midwest and in the UK and in the Benelux countries. Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus : Okay. And then internally, how are you evaluating -- how are you valuing the Shred-it transaction? In other words what you contributed in there? And the reason I\u2019m asking that question is it seems like the transaction cost of $26.3 million is like -- at least versus the investment, it seems like you paid a fee of 7.2%. That sounds like an IPO fee unless you valued the transaction much higher than net investment? Bill Gale : Mike you want to take him through a little details there? Mike Hansen : Sure. Shlomo, we did not use any investment banking firm to do this. Instead the transaction costs that you refer to, a large portion of it relates to the stock compensation expense because we early vested stock options and restricted shares for those employees who move from Cintas to the joint venture. We also had some costs, certainly some legal and professional costs related to public accounting, firms looking at the tax side of things and looking at the valuation for our accounting purposes. We had some IT contracts that had to be canceled that were specifically related to the Document Shredding business. So those are the kind of costs that were incurred as part of the shredding transaction itself. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Sean Kim with RBC Capital Markets. Sean Kim - RBC Capital Markets : I guess sort of looking back at fiscal \u201914, I think your results for the full year came in probably at the high-end or ahead of what your initial guidance would have suggested a year ago. So I guess, what do you think drove the better performance? Because it seems like if we think about what your comments about add/stop trends during the year, it doesn\u2019t seem like much has changed. So I was just wondering what do you think drove the better performances here? Bill Gale : I think Sean, it was really an excellent execution on the part of our Rental business and our First Aid and Safety business. They were able to squeeze more capacity out of existing operations. They did very well on new business. As Mike mentioned, we saw a little bit of an uptick in the pricing environment, which helped. And I think that was really the reason that we surpassed our initial feel of guidance on both the revenue side and EPS side. Sean Kim - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. And in terms of share repurchases, assuming no major M&A activity, do you think it\u2019s safe for us to assume a similar level of stock repurchases that you done over the past couple of years? Bill Gale : Sean, that's hard to say because I would tell you that we want to make acquisitions, but obviously if we don\u2019t then we would anticipate that we would use that cash to purchase our own stock. I would not model it that way. I would hope that we would be able to make some acquisitions, but again you know and I know that you just can\u2019t predict when that will happen. Operator : It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Gale and Mr. Hansen; I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Bill Gale : I would just like to thank everyone for joining us this evening. It was a very complicated quarter, but you all are pretty smart people because you all pretty much figured it out. And therefore we appreciate your support. We will anticipate providing our first quarter update sometime in the latter part of September. So thank you again. Have a good rest of the summer. Operator : And this does conclude today\u2019s Cintas quarterly earnings results conference call. We thank you again for your participation.",

Baird Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review Dan Dolev - Jefferies Operator : Good day everyone and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Bill Gale : Thank you for joining us this evening. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas\u2019s Vice President and Treasurer. After our commentary we will be happy to answer questions. Let me remind you that the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company\u2019s current views as to future events and financial performance. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We are pleased to report first quarter revenue of $1.102 billion. Organic revenue growth which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and the Shred-it Transaction was 7.2% for the first quarter. This was a nice acceleration from the 6.2% organic growth in our fourth quarter ended May 31st, led by a rental organic growth of 8.1% and our first aid safety and fire protection services organic growth rate up 10.1%. Our sales force performance in both businesses was strong and the pricing environment in the first quarter improved from our previous quarter. We were a little disappointed with the negative 2.2% organic growth change in our uniform direct sale revenue as we have a third consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue decline. While much of the declines in the last three quarters relates to large national account roll-outs occurring last year and not repeating this year, we have seen some softness in our Fortune 1000 national accounts as well. As we noted in today\u2019s press release, our first quarter income statement was affected by a few items that are not representative of our ongoing operational performance. First, as we indicated in our July earnings call, we had a $13.6 million gain net of tax on the sale of stock in an equity method investment during this year\u2019s first quarter. Second, our fiscal \u201815 first quarter income from continuing operations did not include any document management services operating segment results. Mike will provide more details about the accounting for document management and its impact on the first quarter and the remainder of this fiscal \u201815 year. Third, we recorded an additional $4.1 million gain, net of tax, during this year\u2019s first quarter, due to receiving additional proceeds related to the Shred-it Transaction. We have identified these items separately in today\u2019s press release, so I will speak to the results as adjusted for those items. Our first quarter gross margin was $477.9 million or $43.4% of first quarter revenue. As Scott Farmer said in today\u2019s press release, the gross margin improved in each of our businesses. In fact, the first quarter\u2019s gross margin of 43.4% was the highest as a percent of revenue since fiscal 2006. We continue to operate our businesses very efficiently and are taking advantage of existing capacity in our infrastructure. First quarter operating income was $163.5 million or 14.8% of first quarter revenue. We\u2019re very pleased with this improvement over last fiscal year\u2019s first quarter adjusted operating income as a percent of revenue of 13.4%. First quarter net income and earnings per diluted share as adjusted also improved nicely compared to last fiscal year\u2019s first quarter amount as adjusted. First quarter net income as adjusted was $92.4 million, which was 8.4% of revenue and grew by almost 21% over last year\u2019s first quarter. This fiscal year\u2019s first quarter earnings per diluted share as adjusted was $0.78, which grew over 25% compared to last fiscal year\u2019s first quarter figure as adjusted of $0.62. We are very pleased with the start to this fiscal year and thank our employees who we call partners for their hard work and dedication. I will turn the call over to Mike for more details on the first quarter performance and the impact of the Document Management Business. And then, I will provide a few comments on our updated fiscal 2015 guidance. Mike Hansen : Thanks, Bill and good evening. I\u2019ll start with a few comments on Document Management. We indicated in today\u2019s press release that we have changed our accounting classification of the document storage and imaging business to discontinued operations. We\u2019re evaluating strategic opportunities for this business, and we\u2019ll provide more details as appropriate. The classification of this business as discontinued operations means under U.S. generally accepted accounted principles that we must condense all income statement impact from the business into one line on the income statement for all periods presented. As a result, we will no longer show any documents storage and imaging revenue, gross margin or operating income in either this year\u2019s or last year\u2019s income statement. Instead, the entire results in both years are condensed into one line item on the income statement, entitled income from discounted operations net of tax. Let\u2019s switch to Document Shredding. Because we continue to have an ownership in the Document Shredding business through our partnership with Shred-it, U.S. GAAP says we really haven\u2019t exited the business. As a result we will continue to include document shredding results in last fiscal year\u2019s income statement; however, beginning with this first quarter of fiscal \u201815, we will no longer report any document shredding revenue, gross margin, or operating income. Instead, we will simply show our share of the partnership income in our corporate operating segment. During the first quarter of fiscal \u201915, there was no impact from the partnership. From a modeling perspective, the end result of these changes in document management accounting means that we will have no document management operating segment results going forward. The easiest way to model the comparison of fiscal \u201815 results to last year will be to exclude the entire document management operating segment results from last year. So, as a result of the changes I just discussed, we now have three reportable operating segments. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, and First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services. Uniform Direct Sales and First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of our income statement. Before moving into the first quarter results, let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in this year\u2019s first quarter which is the same as last year\u2019s first quarter. Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal \u201915, we will have 65 workdays in each quarter for a total of 260 workdays for the fiscal year. These workday figures for fiscal \u201915 are the exact same as in fiscal \u201814, so we will have no workday differences or adjustments for the remainder of this fiscal year. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue was $857 million, which is up 8.1% compared to last year\u2019s first quarter. Organic growth was also 8.1%. Growth of roughly one-half of 1% was due to a contractual buyout caused by a change in government regulation that forced a customer to close one of its operations. As Bill mentioned the performance of our sales team continued to be strong and first quarter new business was better than last year. In addition, the pricing environment improved relative to the fourth quarter and last year\u2019s first quarter. We still have not seen much impact from net add-stops which were down slightly compared to last year\u2019s first quarter. Our Rental segment gross margin was 45.1% for the first quarter, an increase from 42.6% in last year\u2019s first quarter. As bill mentioned, we\u2019ve continued to leverage our infrastructure and are operating very efficiently. In addition, we continue to sell products and services that do not require additional processing capacity such as our hygiene products and services and our chemical dispensing services. Lastly the more favorable pricing environment help drive incremental margins as well. Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue for the first quarter was $105 million, which was 2.2% lower than last year\u2019s first quarter. As Bill indicated earlier, lower sales to our Fortune 1000 national accounts has been the driver of the revenue decline. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 29% for the first quarter, an improvement over last year\u2019s first quarter gross margin of 27.7%, while our revenue was lower than last year\u2019s first quarter. Our sales mix was more weighted towards our higher margin hospitality business. Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue for the first quarter was $140 million, which is 11.3% higher than last year\u2019s first quarter. Organic growth was 10.1%. This businesses sales team continued to perform well and our national account business continues to thrive. This segment\u2019s gross margin was 43.7% in the first quarter which is fairly consistent with last year\u2019s first quarter of 43.6%. Switching to selling and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 28.5% as a percentage of revenue in the first quarter compared to a total company SG&A in last year\u2019s first quarter of 28.8%. When excluding the impact of the document shredding had on last year\u2019s first quarter SG&A and revenue, last year\u2019s adjusted total company SG&A was 27.8% as a percentage of the adjusted revenue. The increase in SG&A as a percent of revenue from last year\u2019s adjusted 27.8% to this year\u2019s 28.5% is due to two items. First our worker\u2019s comp and auto insurance related costs were higher in this year\u2019s first quarter compared to last year. Second as we mentioned in our earnings call in July the contribution of the document shredding business to the Shred-it partnership leaves less revenue to cover our SG&A structure. Specifically certain corporate G&A expenses such as the operation of our corporate headquarters must now be allocated to our remaining three operating segments instead of the four operating segments that we had last year. We expect this headwind to continue for the remainder of this fiscal year. Our effective tax rate was 37.4% for the quarter, compared to 37.2% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve bills and releases related to specific discrete items. We expect fiscal \u201815 effective rate to be 37.3%. Turning now to the balance sheet, as a result of the classification of the document storage and imaging business had discontinued operations. Our August 31st balance sheet now shows all assets associated with that business in one-line item entitled assets held for sale. The balance in this line item at August 31st was $151 million. There is also a line item entitled liabilities held for sale, which incorporates certain liabilities associated specifically to the documents storage and imaging business at August 31st. The balance in outline item at August 31st was $15 million. Our cash and cash equivalents were $581 million at August 31st, an increase of $68 million from the $513 million at May 31st, mainly due to strong operating cash flow. Accounts receivables decreased by $19 million since May 31st due to improved collection performance and the reclassification of documents, storage and imaging related AR to assets held for sales. New goods inventory and in service inventory levels at August 31st were $250 million and $514 million respectively. These balances are relatively consistent with the balances at May 31st. Accrued compensation and related liabilities at August 31st decreased by $41 million from the May 31st balance mainly due to the payment of fiscal year \u201814 bonuses and commissions. Long-term debt remained at $1.3 billion representing roughly 1.7 times EBITDA and finally CapEx for the first quarter was about $68 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows. $61 million in Rental including roughly $25 million related to the SAP project, $2 million in Uniformed Direct Sales, and $5 million in First Aid Safety and Fire Protection. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of $275 million to $325 million. I will not turn the call back to Bill for comments on our updated fiscal 2015 guidance. Bill Gale : Thank you, Mike. We\u2019re updating our fiscal 2015 revenue guidance to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.475 billion. This revenue guidance has changed from our initial guidance provided in July to reflect the elimination of document storage and imaging revenue due to its classification as discontinued operations. This updated guidance also reflects our first quarter revenue performance and our thoughts on the U.S. economic environment for the remainder of our fiscal 2015 year. As Scott Farmer indicated in our press release earlier today, we believe the U.S. economy remains inconsistent and we believe recent global events increase the unpredictability of the environment. We are also updating our fiscal 2015 earnings per diluted share guidance to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.29. This guidance reflects a number of items. First we have eliminated the benefits from the documents storage and imaging business. Second, we have incorporated the additional $0.04 Shred-it Transaction gain. Third, this updated guidance continues to assume no benefit from the Shred-it partnership but does reflect the first quarter $0.11 gain on the sale of stock in an equity method investment which was also in the initial guidance provided in July. Lastly the updated guidance reflects the first quarter performance and also our thoughts on the U.S. economic environment. This concludes our prepared remarks and we will now be glad to answer your questions. Operator :  Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And we\u2019ll take our first question from John Healy with Northcoast Research. John Healy - Northcoast Research :  Bill, I had this question come in to me. I just was hoping to get a little bit more color on the guidance. If I think about the moving parts, the $0.11 item was already in the guidance and you kind of called out the $0.04 gain. So if I back that out, the guidance looks like it\u2019s moving up by about $0.10. How should we think about that $0.10 from a contribution standpoint in terms of how does your view on the economy change and the other item I thought that would be contributing to it would be, how do we think about the movements of document storage now that it\u2019s in discontinued ops, if that\u2019s a net positive or how that impacted the guidance? Bill Gale : Well, the document storage and imaging business did have a minor contribution to our initial guidance, it was about $0.03. So, basically you are backing that out. I think you accounted for the $0.04 special gain in the first quarter due to the Shred-it Transaction, but you are correct that we are increasing guidance on the rental first aid business and our direct sale business basically. Primarily, as the result of the first quarter results, which were better than we originally expected, and while we expect the rest of the year to be good, we don\u2019t expect it to be as robust as we saw in the first quarter. Again, it could be a bit conservative on our part, but there has been ongoing inconsistency in the jobs reports. We still are seeing a reluctance in the part of many of our customers to expand our operations, to add employees. As Mike indicated, there was very little, there was no help from add-stops in the quarter, basically it continues to be from new business and then again as he said, a better pricing environment. So, I guess in summary what we are saying is yes increased guidance from continuing operations but probably not at the same rate that you saw in the first quarter. John Healy - Northcoast Research : And I wanted to ask, when I was taking the notes from your initial comments, it sounded like you guys were at the margin I would say talking positively about the pricing environment. I feel like it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve heard anything like that on the Uniform Rental Costs. So I was hoping if you could talk to kind of what you are seeing on that side of things? Maybe what\u2019s driving it? Is it a cost push in the business or is it more disciplined from industry competitors or just some more color that you are seeing there? Bill Gale : Well I went back and looked at some of our releases last year and our calls. And I think we did indicate that pricing environment was beginning to improve even in fiscal \u201814. And I think what happened in this first quarter is we saw continued improvement. I think part of it is driven by probably a better education on our part for our service providers and sales people to go to our customers and explain that we\u2019ve had the cost increases over the last several years and have not really been able to pass those on to the extent that we feel justified that we should be able to. So I don\u2019t want to create a belief that we just have really skyrocketed prices, we haven\u2019t, but we certainly have been able to get more of a price increase than we have since the end of the recession. John Healy - Northcoast Research :  And then just final question from me on the discounted ops. Any thought in terms of when we might see that kind of realistically come to a close? Is it a quarter out or two quarters out, how should we think about that? Bill Gale : John, I really can\u2019t answer that question right now. There\u2019s a lot of things going on. So it would be premature for me to speculate on a specific timeframe. Operator :  And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Unidentified Analyst :  Hi this is actually Greg calling on for Manav. I was hoping you could talk maybe about the specific industry verticals. I know you said that the recovery has been inconsistent. But I was wondering if maybe you could talk to specific verticals that you\u2019ve seen some strength in recently? Mike Hansen : Well, as it relates to our performance Greg, it\u2019s been relatively broad revenue growth for us. Our new business still comes from customers of all different types. We\u2019ve been able to sell additional products and services into existing customers of all types. And so, I would say that it\u2019s been a fairly broad revenue growth stream for us. As we look at the job performance, even in this first quarter as well as the entire calendar year, we\u2019ve generally seen a bit of narrow employment improvement, and about a third coming -- about a third of the employment growth coming from some verticals that don\u2019t help our businesses, particularly uniform rental much and that being professional services, fast-food service, temps, education. But having said that, we\u2019ve been able to continue to sell to many different verticals both in new business and in penetrating with additional products and services. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, fair enough. And then maybe on the M&A pipeline. How active has that been and do you expect to ramp-up post some of these document management transactions? Bill Gale : Well, we\u2019ve have been -- we\u2019ve remained active Greg, in the M&A area throughout the last couple of years. And as I have indicated in the past, it\u2019s not for lack of effort on our part, it\u2019s for the appropriate valuation that we feel an acquisition would make sense for our shareholders. So, at this point, we are still very much wanting to do some big acquisitions, and we are continuing to work diligently for those. But there is nothing at this point that has come to fruition, primarily because of valuation expectations. Operator : Next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Unidentified Analyst : This is Daniel again for Scott. Can you address some of the margin enhancing initiatives you are doing this year that can provide potential upside to your current outlook? Bill Gale : Well, I think the first quarter was reflective of a lot of things we\u2019ve already been able to implement. It\u2019s greater utilization of our plans and our routes. It\u2019s more selling of products and services that do not require the processing through our laundry facilities, things like chemical dispending and hygiene services et cetera. I think it also is just an attitude on the part of the company to continue to drive excess cloths out of the business and work toward improving the margins back to the levels that we had achieved prior to the recession. We had stable energy cost, so we didn\u2019t have to deal with that this quarter. Better utilization of our stockrooms for our Uniform business. So, I think it\u2019s just a number of different things. As far as looking out for the rest of the year, I think you as look at our guidance what we\u2019re saying is we would probably anticipate maintaining margins at relatively the same levels that we achieved in the first quarter. As far as any significant upside potential, I doubt if that is really available. I\u2019d say it\u2019s more maintaining what we\u2019ve achieved. Operator : Next question comes from George Tong with Piper Jaffray. Please go head. George Tong - Piper Jaffray : Good afternoon. Can you discuss how add/stop performance in the quarter compared versus your expectations and what your views are for add/stop performance next quarter? Bill Gale : Well, we talked to last quarter that net add/stops were slightly better than the previous year. In this first quarter, they were slightly lower than last year. And so we really haven\u2019t seen much of a trend. We\u2019ve continued to kind of bump along with net add/stops. We haven\u2019t seen any change in that performance or any discernable trends in September either. And so, we are expecting that we\u2019ll just kind of continue to bump along relatively and consistently in net add/stops, and don\u2019t anticipate that our customers will start hiring at any rapid pace anytime soon. George Tong - Piper Jaffray : Got it. And your updated guidance does that incorporate improvements and add/stop performance? Bill Gale : Not really. It pretty much just reflects kind of a status quo where we don\u2019t really see any improvement over prior years in add/stops but we\u2019ll continued new business, which is basically new customers and increased penetration of different products and services. And then hopefully a reasonable pricing environment continuing as we saw in the first quarter. George Tong - Piper Jaffray : That\u2019s very helpful. And as you look at margin performance, how would you segment out contribution from pricing versus greater route and planned utilization versus the say cost savings initiatives? Bill Gale : I really don\u2019t have a way of doing that very easily George and probably wouldn\u2019t be able to disclose that even if I had it because of competitive things. But I would say all of them are contributing factors. And it\u2019s, basically you\u2019ve got all different sorts of initiatives going on from different levels of capital investments, from efficiencies. Obviously the pricing helps. So, it\u2019s just very difficult for me to be able to split that kind of stuff out. George Tong - Piper Jaffray : Got it. And last question, this is a longer-term strategic question. But with respect to margins, how do you think about the path to peak margins in terms of just how long it takes to get there and whether your success in pushing through pricing, whether that means you can break above prior peak margins? Bill Gale : I am not sure I would commit to breaking above prior peak margins. I\u2019d love to be able to get back to those margins in the future. And I think we\u2019re making very good progress towards that regard. But keep in mind, the cost of doing business today is more than what it cost back in 2005 and \u201906, we hit those margins. So, we are attempting to get back there, but to exceed it would be pretty difficult thing to do, I think. Operator : We have Andy Whitman, Robert W. Baird. Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird: Hey, guys good afternoon. Bill, I don\u2019t want to make two side of a point on it, but you made a comment that the margins that you put up here in the first quarter might kind of continue through the balance of the year. Are you referring to the year-over-year growth in margins on the operating line, which really the 140 basis points on the clean basis or you\u2019re saying the absolute level or is that referenced to the gross margins? Maybe just a little, again not trying the two side of a point, but I want to understand what you meant by that. Bill Gale : Well, sorry for the confusion Andy. What I was saying the absolute level of the margins should be relative, I would hope, would be relatively to close what we achieved in the first quarter. Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird: Okay, great. And then just on the revenue line you kind of gave us some help about the document storage business, in fact $0.03, you talked about. On the top line, what was your forecast for what that business can do? We were modeling somewhere around $80 million, maybe $90 million, is that about right? Bill Gale : Absolutely right. Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird: So then really you do have a slight raise than on the revenue line, if you kind of adjust for that as well. Just a little bit, but a little bit of on the revenue line. Bill Gale : You are correct. Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird: Okay. And then just as it relates to the government contract you highlighted, you said that half of percentage point Mike. Should we see that basically as kind of a one-time benefit? So, you can make the argument that the segment growth of 8.1, because really the 7.6, still very good but not quite 8.1? Mike Hansen : That\u2019s right Andy, but it\u2019s not a government contract. It is a customer. It was a commercial customer who, because of a government regulation, was forced to close down some of their operations and therefore they bought out of their contract. So it was not to having to do with the government so we\u2019ll get sure clarify that. Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird: No, that\u2019s helpful. And then just as it relates to the asset for sale for the storage business, it\u2019s on the balance sheet like you noted for 151. I guess when you move things to discontinued operations and assets for sale, you have to at least to evaluation test there. I guess I think is it true that you would, if it would have been less than the 150, you would have market-to-market that what you thought it was. So, can we assume that the 151 would be a minimum for what you get for it? Mike Hansen : Well, you are absolutely right. We have an obligation to impair it if it were not going to get that value. So, this is all subjective. But our expectation is that those were fair values that are on the balance sheet. Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird: To call it asset for sale or to put in discontinued, do you need a letter of intent or something more formal or is it really just a subjective decision or just using this as maybe a way for investors to gauge where you might be along in that process? Bill Gale : It\u2019s a very complex set of analysis that one must go through, and we decided to be conservative. And basically classify it that way since we believe that within the next months we won\u2019t necessarily be operating those as we are today, they\u2019ll be part of a joint venture or they\u2019ll be sold to another party. Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird: And then can you just afford maybe one last question, I wanted to ask about the ancillary services and the rental segment. And I\u2019ve asked this one plenty of times before. But maybe Mike can you talk about the relative growth rates of the ancillary services versus what you consider core uniform rental? And maybe just as it relates to the longer-term trend, you\u2019ve always talked about how the number of services that you can offer customer increases your retention. But how has that number of services and products that you\u2019ve been offering tracked? Can you give us some sense about how that\u2019s improved over the last couple of years, if it\u2019s improved? Mike Hansen : Okay, regarding your first question about the growth of the different products and services. We have seen very good growth in our uniform rental business, and we have seen growth in our ancillary products and services. So, the mat rental, the hygiene products and service, which is made-up of air fresheners and soaps and towel dispensers and the chemical dispensing. All are growing quite nicely. We won\u2019t get into the specific level of growth on any of them, but they are all growing quite nicely. And we continue to improve the amounts of products and services at our existing customers. We still believe we have a long way and a long great opportunity continue adding those. But certainly they have gotten better, in terms of the penetration amounts, have gotten better in the last few years. That doesn\u2019t give you any specific numbers. But we don\u2019t really get into the specifics of any of those. But I can tell you that directionally we\u2019re doing very well. Operator : We\u2019ll move to Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan: I just wanted to focus on the revenues guidance of 4.9% to 6.7%. I assume very little of that has acquisition, past acquisition, baked in to just like the first quarter had only 20 basis point differential. And so my question is assuming that point is right and we get over 7% growth in the first quarter, is there anything other than a conservative view on the economy that suggest more like a mid-single digit like a 5% growth for the balance of the year to kind of get into the 4.9% to 6.7% range with the same percent start? Bill Gale : Your assumption first, and yes there is no real acquisition growth going forward other than what you just saw. Mike Hansen : And Andrew, I would say that is a pretty good summation of our view for the rest of the year, and that\u2019s what reflected in the guidance. Yes, again, we are being somewhat conservative, driven by enlarge by what we continue to see this inconsistency, and then all the different activity going around the world that seems to impact people\u2019s thinking on business. So, obviously, if we can achieve similar results in the rest of the year that we saw in the first quarter, we\u2019ll be at the upper end if not exceed that guidance. So obviously, if it goes the other way, we\u2019ll be down the lower-end. Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan: And could you just mention how much storage -- document storage revenues were in the previous guide, I mean what was taken out of the guide and put into discontinued ops for 2015? Bill Gale : Maybe for $85 million, last year\u2019s storage revenue was $82 million. And so it\u2019s roughly that same amount. Operator : We\u2019ll move to Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review. Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review : Based on the cash flow statement, there appears to be about 61.4 million in the repurchase of common stock. I just was curious as to the timing of that and the number of shares. Mike Hansen : Well, 700 and some thousand shares were the result of the share purchase program that we reported to you in July. That was kind of the combination of the 4.2 million shares we bought beginning in our fourth quarter. Then the remainder of that was due to the fact when we have restricted stock that that\u2019s with our partners. There is a tax obligation as a considered ordinary income. And so what we do is we basically sell enough of a share that they invest and to pay for the payroll taxes. Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review : Okay, so there really wasn\u2019t anything new in this fiscal quarter? Mike Hansen : No. Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review : Okay and probably 10 years ago I was in one year plans for Investor Day or something like that, and there was great discussion and potential around RFID. And just wonder if anything has occurred in that regard in terms of making that a viable solution in some of the plans? Mike Hansen : It really has not. We continue to experiment with it, but it has not really proven to be beneficial yet. And we are certainly trying it but it\u2019s nothing we\u2019ve been able to rollout. Operator : (Operator Instructions) And we next move to Dan Dolev with Jefferies. Dan Dolev - Jefferies: Just really a macro question, Bill, I am just thinking about your comments today and compare them to your comments the last, maybe quarter or two. Am I misreading it or you incrementally more bearish on the U.S. economy or is it just over-interpreting you analysis or is it everything the same really? Bill Gale : I think it\u2019s the same. I don\u2019t think my view, our view I shouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s my view, our views have really changed from the way we felt the last couple of quarters. We were obviously pleased with the first quarter results, better than what we initially expected. But has that given us confidence that that will continue, not yet. And we\u2019d love to be able to continue to surprise everybody on the upside, but I just not confident enough to give you that comfort. Dan Dolev - Jefferies: No, that\u2019s help. I thought I sense something, but I guess I was over interpreting. I appreciate it. Mike Hansen : Thank you all very much for joining us and being interested in the results. And at this point, we would expect to issue our second quarter results some time before the Christmas holiday in mid to late December. So, until then, thank you again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great rest of your day.",

Baird Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Dan Dolev - Jefferies Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan Operator : Good day everyone and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Bill Gale : Thank you for joining us this evening. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. As we reported in today's press release, our results for continuing operations adjusted to exclude all impacts of the document management businesses are more representative of our ongoing performance. Therefore, our discussion of the company's performance will be based on that, the exclusion of document management. We are pleased to report second quarter revenue of $1.123 billion. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency and the Shred-It transaction was 7.2% for the second quarter. Rental organic growth was 8.1%. And First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services organic growth was 12.1%. The performance of our sales force in both businesses remain strong and penetration of additional products and services into existing customers continued. Our second quarter gross margin was $481.4 million or 42.9% of second quarter revenue. This was a nice improvement over last year's 41.3% as we continue to leverage our infrastructure, continue to operate very efficiently, and increased our revenue per stop from added penetration at existing customers. Second quarter operating income was $181.6 million or 16.2% of second quarter revenue. This was a 20.7% increase over last year's second quarter operating income of $150.5 million or 14.3% of last year's revenue. Second quarter net income and earnings per diluted share as adjusted also improved nicely compared to last fiscal year second quarter amount, as adjusted. Second quarter net income was $103.7 million, which was 9.2% of revenue and grew by 24% over last year's second quarter. Second quarter earnings per diluted share as adjusted was $0.86, which grew over 26% compared to last fiscal year's second quarter figure as adjusted of $0.68. As Scott Farmer indicated in our press release today, our employees, who we call partners, have executed our game plan very effectively, and we look forward to the second half of our fiscal year. We are updating our fiscal 2015 guidance as a result of our second quarter results. Before discussing the guidance though, let me make a few comments on our views of the economy. We have certainly been pleased with the U.S. employment growth in the last few months. While the employment growth continues to be more narrow than we would like, the overall growth totals have been good. This has not yet translated into marketable improvements in our rental net add-stops metric. But our customers are recognizing the value of our products and services and our penetration continues to be solid. Our guidance assume that the U.S. economy will remain in this current state during the second half of our fiscal year. We do believe, however, that this economic state is fairly fragile. Many macro factors such as interest rate environment, energy prices and global economic issues could upset the U.S. momentum, and so we are hesitant to turn too optimistic. With these views in mind and based on our second quarter results, we now expect our fiscal 2015 revenue to be in the range of $4.45 billion to $4.5 billion. We now expect our fiscal 2015 earnings per diluted share guidance to be in the range of $3.49 to $3.54. When excluding the special items of the impact of the document shredding business and the additional gain on the Shred-It transaction, the impact of the sale of stock and an equity investment and the impact of the discontinued operations, including the sale of document storage and imaging business, we expect fiscal 2015 earnings per diluted share guidance to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.25. This EPS guidance is detailed in the table within today's press release. I will now turn the call over to Mike for more details on the second quarter performance. Mike Hansen : Thanks, Bill, and good evening. Before moving into the second quarter results, let me remind you that there were 65 work days in this year's second quarter, which is the same as last year's second quarter. Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2015, we will have 65 work days in each quarter, for a total of 260 work days for the fiscal year. These work day figures for fiscal 2015 are the exact same as in fiscal 2014, so we will have no work day differences or adjustments for the remainder of this fiscal year. We have three reportable operating segments, Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services. Uniform Direct Sales and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restaurant supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue was $865 million, which is up 7.6% compared to last year's second quarter. Organic growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency changes, was 8.1%. Organic growth was higher than total growth because of the weakening of the Canadian dollar. As Bill mentioned, the performance of our sales team continued to be strong. We did not see a marketable improvement in net add-stops compared to last year's second quarter, but we did see our typical seasonal net adds for jackets and entrance mats. Entrance mat net adds were somewhat stronger than last year due to the early wintery weather this year. Penetration of additional products and services to existing customers remains strong. Our Rental segment gross margin was 44.8% for the second quarter, an increase from 42.9% in last year's second quarter. Energy-related costs were 20 basis points lower than in last year's second quarter. We've continued to leverage our infrastructure and are operating very efficiently. The second quarter Rental gross margin of 44.8% was a decrease from this fiscal year's first quarter gross margin of 45.1% due to a number of items, none of which are significant. Energy-related costs in the second quarter were 20 basis points lower than in this year's -- this fiscal year's first quarter. Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue for the second quarter was $117.5 million, which was 3.6% lower than last year's second quarter. When adjusting for foreign currency changes, the organic decrease was 3.2%. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 27.6% for the quarter, a decrease from last year's second quarter gross margin of 28.8%. This decrease was due to lesser volumes and a mix towards lower-margin accounts. Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training, and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue for the second quarter was $140.4 million, which is 12.7% higher than last year's second quarter. Organic growth was 12.1%. As has been the case for the last few years, this business continues to execute at high levels and continues to innovate with new products and services. This segment's gross margin was 43.8% in the second quarter, which is slightly above last year's second quarter of 43.4%. Energy-related costs were 20 basis points lower than last year's second quarter. The second quarter gross margin of 43.8% is fairly consistent with this fiscal year's first quarter gross margin of 43.7%. Energy-related costs were 20 basis points lower than the first quarter. Moving to a few comments on the document shredding business. As a reminder, under U.S. Generally Accepted Account Principles, we will continue to include document shredding results in last fiscal year's income statement. However, beginning with the first quarter of this year, fiscal 2015, we no longer record any document shredding revenue, gross margin or operating income. Instead we will simply show our share of the partnership income in our corporate operating segment. During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, there was a slight loss of $300,000 net of tax from the partnership. Switching to selling and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 26.7% as a percentage of revenue in the second quarter, compared to a total company SG&A in last year's second quarter of 28%. When excluding the impact that document shredding had on last year's second quarter SG&A and revenue, last year's adjusted total company SG&A was 27% as a percent of the adjusted revenue. The decrease in SG&A as a percent of revenue from last year's adjusted 27% to this year's 26.7% is made up of a number of minor changes from last year, none of which are of any significance. Looking ahead to our third quarter, keep in mind that payroll taxes reset with the new calendar year. We expect this resetting to increase third quarter payroll taxes by roughly 80 basis points over second quarter levels. Our effective tax rate was 37.4% for the quarter, compared to 37.8% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on tax reserve billeds [ph] and releases relating to specific discrete items. We expect the fiscal 2015 effective rate to be 37.3%. As we discussed on our first quarter conference call, we changed our accounting classification of the document storage and imaging business to discontinued operations, effective with this fiscal year's first quarter reporting. The classification of this business as discontinued operations means, under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, that we must condense all income statement impact from the business into one line on the income statement for all periods presented. As a result, we no longer show any document storage and imaging revenue, gross margin or operating income in either this year's or last year's income statement. Instead, the entire results in both years are condensed into one line on the income statement, entitled 'income from discontinued operations net of tax.' For this year's second quarter, we had $17 million of net income from discontinued operations net of tax. This income resulted in earnings per diluted share from discontinued operations of $0.14. Included in this net income figure is a gain on the sale of the document storage and imaging business totaling $16.3 million net of all related expenses and taxes. As we announced on November 6th, 2014, we sold this business in three separate transactions which closed this past October and November. The aggregate consideration of these businesses was roughly $180 million. We received roughly $160 million of cash at closing with holdbacks [ph] of roughly $20 million to be determined over the next 12 months. The gain in this second quarter was computed based on the $160 million of cash received at closing. Our cash and cash equivalents were $827 million at November 30th, an increase of $245 million from the $581 million at August 31st. Again we received cash of $180 million from the sale of document storage and imaging -- $160 million. The remaining increase was generated from our operating cash flow. Keep in mind that we paid our annual dividend of $202 million on December 5th. Accounts receivable increased $21 million since August 31st due to the increase in sales. New goods inventory and in-service inventory levels at November 30th were $236 million and $528 million, respectively. These balances are fairly consistent with the balances at August 31st. Accounts payable increased roughly $30 million since August 31st due to the timing of vendor payment due dates. Current accrued liabilities were $503 million at November 30th, an increase of $210 million. This increase was due to the accrued dividend of $202 million at November 30th. Note that the assets and liabilities classified as held for sale at August 31st were sold as part of the document storage and imaging sale, except for certain document storage real estate properties that remain classified as held for sale at November 30th, these properties are currently being leased to the buyers of that business. Long-term debt remained at $1.3 billion, representing roughly 1.7 times EBITDA. And finally, CapEx for the second quarter was about $45 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows : $35 million in Rental, $3 million in Uniform Direct Sales, and $7 million First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of $250 million to $275 million. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now be glad to answer any of your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Manof Phenix [ph] from Barclays. Greg Bisbee - Barclays: Hi. This is Greg actually calling on for Manof [ph]. Just wanted to get some details on your energy costs in this lower cost environment. Does the current guidance that you have assume that oil prices and gas stay this low or is there potential upside should we remain at these low rates? Bill Gale : Greg, as you know, our guidance has a range of about a nickel, and our basic assumption is that, generally speaking, the experience that we had in our second quarter will continue for the rest of the year. So let me just give a little color on that, because we anticipated this. If you look at the average price of fuel, and this is taken from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, in our fiscal second quarter, the average price of gas was $3.13 a gallon and the average price of diesel was $3.71 a gallon. In the first quarter, the average price of gas was $3.54 a gallon and the average price of diesel was $3.88 a gallon. Now, keep in mind, a little over 50% of our fleet is diesel, and we have not seen the dramatic drop in diesel prices that we've been seeing in gas prices. But if you think about what happened in our energy prices from the first quarter to the second quarter as a basis of revenue, we had about a 14 or 10-basis-point decline in the cost of our revenues. So, you know, while it's having an impact, we would expect the kind of experience we had in the second quarter to continue through the year. If we get what we saw late in the second quarter continue through the year, then we -- that would help us, all else being equal, to achieve toward the higher end of the guidance. Greg Bisbee - Barclays: Okay, very helpful. And I guess along the same theme, I was wondering if you had gotten any feedback from your customers on the lower costs and if it's impacting their business and maybe, you know, specific to your energy customers, how big is that to you, and what do you expect that impact to be for those contracts? Bill Gale : Well, no particular industry is overly significant to us, but there's no question that if these energy prices continue with these levels, our exploration customers, which have been pretty robust here in the last several years, are going to be impacted. And therefore, if they start laying off some of their employees, that will certainly have an impact on our revenue from those type of customers. It's not material but it will have -- it will be negative. On the other hand, lower energy prices would seem to me to drive some benefit for other types of businesses. So I think it's hard to really say whether or not it's going to have, you know, a negative or a positive impact on the company because there's going to be some industries that will benefit and some that won't. Greg Bisbee - Barclays: Fair enough. And if I can sneak in one more, just on the buyback slowdown this quarter, does that have anything to do with the special dividend and what's your appetite for buybacks going forward? Bill Gale : Yeah. We are certainly, you know, keep everyone in mind. We bought $250 million worth of stock late in our fourth quarter, into the first quarter, this past fiscal year. We did pay the special dividend in addition to our regular dividend in early December. We also have indicated that we are very, very interested in making acquisitions. And we are continuing to pursue, you know, a fairly active pipeline. Obviously nothing significant has happened at this point, or we would have announced it. So in view of the fact that we may not find the acquisitions that we would like to have, I think the Board has shown in past experience that we will certainly be active in purchasing our own stock if warranted. Greg Bisbee - Barclays: Okay, very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Whitman from R.W. Baird. Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird: Thanks. First, I wanted to give a very sincere congratulations to you, Bill, on a great career, and many successes, and Mike also. Big shoes to fill. Bill, I think we'll all miss your ability to put a dour outlook on the economy when your numbers are actually quite good. So that's what I'll miss the most about these calls. Bill Gale : Well, thank you for the kind words, Andy. Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird: Yeah. But that being said, I have dovetail that into a question, because I think it's the question that everybody is going to be asking, when you look at the guidance range, it looks like there's a material deceleration in the growth rate that you're assuming, in EPS. The fuel benefit only gets better from the average levels that you saw in the second quarter, you alluded to that upside, you know, puts on the top line here. But is there something in the business here that you're seeing either somewhat offset on the cost side coming in or deceleration in some of the businesses that we should be aware of that leads us to the guidance range that you've given here? Bill Gale : Well, I think as Mike mentioned in his comments, keep in mind, we've got the payroll tax reset, which is approximately an 80-basis-point impact in our third quarter. We also had a second quarter in which our experience in our workman's comp and auto claims was better than it had been in the previous couple of quarters. We tend to see a slight increase at our medical costs in the third quarter -- in our third quarter. So with that said, we see a little bit of headwinds there, you know, which will impact the SG&A line and thus would impact the overall margins. I think we've got to keep in perspective that the energy cost, try to put that when I responded to Greg at the first question, is not as significant as some may believe. Certainly we would benefit from continued low gas prices, but it's not as significant as I think some people think. Because our overall energy costs are 2.5% of revenue, of which the delivery side of it is approximately 1.5%. Now, so with that said, we still would like to see a broader employment growth. We have not seen any adds to speak of at existing customers. We have seen additional penetration of products and services at our customers, but we've yet to see really the uniform wears being added. Were that to happen, then we would certainly be at the upper end of the guidance, but based on our current view, we thought the guidance that we provided was appropriate. Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird: Got it. So just -- you mentioned efficiency, obviously the business model has got some leverage in it, but efficiency was a word that was mentioned a few times. Last we checked, the implementation of SAP to the uniform business, the Rental segment, you know, still kind of more in the future than present [ph]. Is there anything that structurally that's new and different or are we seeing other things like leverage, and frankly, price contribution adding more to the margin expansion we're seeing here? I think those are other key questions, then I'll leave it there. Bill Gale : Andy, you're right, the last two things you hit on, leverage of the infrastructure and the price increases have certainly benefited margins. The SAP system is still in its early stages. We will not be piloting anything, at the earliest, until our fiscal 2016, and therefore there really won't be anything benefiting us probably until latter part of 2017 or 2018. So right now it's really one of just getting additional volume within our routes and through our plants. We mentioned previously that we will be constructing some new facilities in various markets. We're not moving as rapidly as we once thought, as we continue to look for the appropriate pieces of land. And therefore, that's one of the reason why you saw a reduction in the CapEx guidance, because we don't think we'll be moving as fast with those -- that new construction as we originally thought. So I would say that as long as we can continue to leverage what we've got, we'll continue to see margins at these levels, adjusted for the SG&A I talked about earlier. Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird: Would you -- on the pricing, would you say that pricing continues to get better sequentially here? Is it -- Bill Gale : You know, we're a little concerned, it's okay to the second quarter, but as we see these lower gasoline prices in the headlines, we're wondering, is that going to create some difficulty for the industry to continue to get the kind of pricing that we've been seeing lately. So I think there is a concern out there that, you know, we'll have to make sure we explain this properly when we continue to try to get price increases. Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird: All right. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe just a follow-up on the discussion around pricing. Could you give us any sense of the magnitude of price increases that you're seeing? Mike Hansen : No, Sara, we don't talk about those in any magnitude publicly. We just, as we said in the first quarter and a little bit today, we did see an improvement in the pricing environment in the last six months compared to a year ago. Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Right. Okay. Last quarter when you talked about margin expectations, it sounded like you were thinking that they'd be flat in the absolute versus the first quarter. And then of course in the second quarter they were up quite nicely. I'm wondering what drove the surprise, if it was a surprise, but what drove the surprise in the quarter. And it may have been pricing and it may have been a little bit of energy, but I'm wondering if there was anything else. Mike Hansen : Well, in the second quarter relative to the first, our overall gross margins were about the same, we got -- which was a very good level year over year, helped by nice -- the nice pricing environment, helped by leverage of our infrastructure, and the penetration of new products and services. The real sequential margin improvement was in that SG&A where Bill mentioned we had better workers' comp and auto experience in the second quarter. And the other thing we talked about in the first quarter was the extra G&A, if you will, because of the document shredding contribution, so we lost quite a bit of revenue to cover that extra G&A. And we've done a very good job of managing our cost structure and kind of rationalizing that G&A to the organization that we have today. And so we're pleased with the execution there. Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And then just last question, would it be possible to give any more color on what's driving the strong uniform rental growth? And I'm thinking new programs versus some market share shifts. Bill Gale : I think a lot of it's driven by the strong execution of new business by our sales organization, so, new customer adds, primarily from the programmer side [ph]. Again approximately two-thirds of our new business is coming from customers who have not used the services before. But I think it also is driven by the additional products and services. As we've spoken about for the last several years, we continue to expand our offerings both within the Rental segment as well as within the First Aid and Safety segment, to provide additional things to our customers. And I think that has helped the growth rates in both those segments. Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Dolev from Jefferies. Dan Dolev - Jefferies: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Question on the gross profit in uniform rental. So if I look at the incremental margins in Q1, they were very strong, in the mid 70s. They decelerated a little bit in Q2. My question is, so it stopped the accelerating trend which started early last year. My question is, it seems like it should be accelerating given the cheaper energy prices. So what was -- what made it decelerate? And the second part of the question is, what kind of level do you think you can maintain throughout 2H? Thanks. Mike Hansen : Well, Dan, in both quarters, our gross margin was very strong, and it's been that way for a number of quarters now, and we continue to get very healthy incremental gross margin in that business. And as long as we continue to penetrate and make our customers more valuable, as long as we can continue to grow without adding capacity, it should be healthy. And so, you know, overall that incremental margin was still very healthy. Dan Dolev - Jefferies: Absolutely. But you see that not decelerating significantly below, so, call it the mid-60s to high-60s. Mike Hansen : Well, I think, Dan, some of that depends on the mix of the revenue that comes. And we've talked a little bit about adding some capacity, rental processing capacity in a few markets in the future. And so it depends on the timing of that capacity addition and it depends a little bit on the mix of revenue that we get. If we see a marketable improvement in our customers' hiring, we may see even better incremental margin. Dan Dolev - Jefferies: Great. Thank you, and congrats again for both of you for the promotion and for the retirement. Bill Gale : Thank you, Dan. Mike Hansen : Thanks, Dan. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Box from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Hey. Good evening guys. Bill Gale : Hi, Joe. Mike Hansen : Hi, Joe. Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets : So I just want to take the rate question from earlier, just take it from a different angle. When you guys are looking at rates and you're saying that rates are actually up, are you looking at core rental rates or are you maybe looking to say a yield number that might include ancillary fees like loss waiver, stuff like that? Just trying to understand what it is. Mike Hansen : What do you mean by rates, Joe? Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Well, just maybe the core rate that you might charge a customer per day. When you're saying pricing is going up. Mike Hansen : When we're talking about pricing, being a little bit of a better environment today than a year ago, what does that mean? Is that your question? Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Correct. Correct. Mike Hansen : Yeah. Well, that -- generally that means when we are renewing some accounts, we're able to do it at a little bit of a better level. When we have -- our contracts generally have an annual price increase opportunity and that annual price increase opportunity can be a little bit easier. And it just comes back to our ability to speak to the value that we're providing to our customers. And we've been able to do a pretty good job of that in the last six months. Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets : That's good to hear, Mike. I just wasn't sure if that was, you know, you're maybe able to tack on some additional surcharges and that was able to raise the bill, and you're maybe considering that core pricing. But it doesn't sound like that's the case. And then -- maybe just switching gears then. I'm curious, from a high level, are you guys starting to see new business formation? Are you still seeing subtractions? Has that been a positive driver? Or is the organic growth really more of a function of ancillary products to existing customers at this point? Bill Gale : Well, there's still no question, we're adding new customers, Joe. Is that indicative of the economy, adding new businesses? I don't think we really could say that for sure, because there are so many businesses that were out there that weren't using our services. So I don't think we could, you know, tell you that there's all these new business adds or whatever. I can just say, from our perspective, we're able to get more companies to take our services and we're getting more of our existing customers to take some of our other services. So I think those are the two primary reasons why you're seeing the growth. Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Understood. Just one last follow-up for you. Are the payroll taxes higher than they'd normally be in 3Q, so there'd actually be a year-over-year impact? Are you just pointing out the sequential change? Bill Gale : Sequential change. We're just trying to make sure that everyone understands that. No, it's not a year-over-year thing, it's a sequential change. Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Okay. So I guess I'm really just trying to understand then why there wouldn't be better SG&A leverage in the back half of the year. And I certainly understand there are some minor things in there like auto claims and workers' comp. Bill Gale : No, there's a lot of things in there. And I think what we're telling you is that we would not expect there to be a significant improvement in the overall SG&A number at this point. We think we've done a pretty good job given the fact we lost a lot of revenue from the document shredding and document storage transactions, and we're trying to get that revenue right-sized for the -- those costs, right-sized for the remaining revenue. I just -- I think that so many of you do you models and then you want to assume the same level of SG&A from the second quarter and the third quarter. So we're telling you that's not the case. What we're also telling you is that we would expect the rates that we saw in the second quarter adjusted for payroll taxes, adjusted for potential increases in workman's comp type cost, to basically be comparable for the rest of the year. Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Understood. Thanks guys, and great quarter. Mike Hansen : Thanks, Joe. Bill Gale : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Thanks. Yeah, let me add guys, Bill and Mike, congratulations to both of you. So you covered it well earlier, but just curious if you could add, if you want to do so at this juncture, your oil and gas exposure as an end-market, just that part of the total mix. I know you mentioned that you didn't think it would be too material on a direct level, maybe on a broader level over time. But just curious on that. Thanks. Bill Gale : Scott, it's in the low single digits. It's nothing of any significance. I don't have the exact number, but as you followed us for years, there's just no one industry that really impacts us all that much. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Great. Thanks. Appreciate that. And then curious on M&A pipeline, you addressed that a little bit earlier as well. Would appreciate if you could delve a little more into the types of things you're seeing. Obviously you have a lot of cash sitting over [ph] on the balance sheet right now, a lot of flexibility with things that you do. And I know that you're going to come across this as a dumb question, but is document management, which seems to have some M&A activity, completely out of the picture? Thanks. Bill Gale : Yeah. Document management is completely out of the picture. We've disposed of the storage and imaging business and we still have our 42% share of the joint venture, but we will not be pursuing any document management transactions within Cintas any longer. We certainly are going to pursue acquisitions in our other businesses. And we will continue to do. There are some big ones, there are some small ones, and there are some good regional players. We also will continue to pursue other businesses that either will complement one of the segments we're already in or may perhaps even be another new segment, although historically we've never gone into a brand-new segment in any big way without testing it first. So I just wanted to be sure everyone understands that we are actively pursuing things within First Aid, Safety, Fire, as well as in the uniform side of the business, and we will continue to do so. But we will not make an acquisition that doesn't make sense economically just because prices may have become a little frothy. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer: Great. And good job and congratulations again. Bill Gale : Thanks. Mike Hansen : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan: Good evening. I was wondering if, Bill, you meant to say, to get to the high end of the revenue guide, that we need add-stops to pick up. I know you said something similar to that. But is that what you meant? Bill Gale : To get -- I really didn't address the revenue, Andrew. I was talking more about the profit side, because I think it was more of a margin question. To get at the high, you know, yes, if we -- I would know. I would tell you that the high end of the revenue guidance does not assume a significant improvement in add-stops. If it would assume a continued good pricing environment, a continued impact of good new business results, and the penetration that we've seen. If we were to see a lot of our customers really adding people and therefore increasing the revenue per stop in a significant way, we certainly would be able to get to that top end of the guidance plus some as we go forward. Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan: Yes. I'm still sort of curious about this add-stop and wondering if you think add-stops will increase this cycle, because when I look at the Labor Board's [ph] diffusion index, it's broadening out. And it's including categories that seemed extremely relevant for uniforms, like manufacturing and warehousing and transportation, but perhaps they're adding people in areas that are uniformed, or something along those lines that I was just wondering if you feel like, if this continues, that add-stops will go up? Bill Gale : I certainly hope so, but I will tell you from our experience with our existing customers, we are not really seeing that type of activity. Now we're not seeing declines either. Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan: Right. Which category do you think needs to kick in more for add-stops to go higher? Bill Gale : Which category, you mean like which\u2026 Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan: Manufacturing, transportation? Bill Gale : Services, I think just generally services. That's the bulk of our customer base, are in the service sectors. Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our Q&A session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Bill Gale for closing remarks. Bill Gale : Again I want to thank everyone for joining us this evening. And on behalf of all my fellow partners here at Cintas and our management team, we want to wish you a very happy holiday season. Mike will be back in March to give you our third quarter results. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We do appreciate your participation. Have a great day. Thank you.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Hansen : Good evening and thank you for joining us this evening as we report our third quarter results for fiscal 2015. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Corporate Controller. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. As we reported in today's press release, our results for continuing operations adjusted to exclude all impacts of the document management businesses are more representative of our ongoing performance. Therefore, our discussion of the company's performance will be based on the exclusion of document management. We are pleased to report third quarter revenue of $1.109 billion. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency and the Shred-It transaction was 7.5% for the third quarter. Each of our businesses organic growth was positive for the third quarter with rental organic growth being 7.8%, Uniform Direct Sales being 4.8%, and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services organic growth being 7.5%. The third quarter revenue impacts from severe winter weather and the oil and gas related customers\u2019 was relatively minor. Paul will touch on this when discussing the individual business results. We\u2019re also pleased to show continued improvements in income as adjusted compared to last year\u2019s third quarter as adjusted as operating income increased 17.1%, net income from continuing operations increased 20.2%, and earnings per diluted share increased 25%. Certainly, lower energy related costs help the comparison to last year, but we also feel good about our ability to leverage our infrastructure and manage our cost structure. Paul will discuss the energy related cost in more detail. We want to recognize our employees and we call partners for their dedication and competitive urgency in serving our customers. They continue to do a great job. Let me make a few comments about the Shred-It investment. First, regarding the presentation on the income statement, we have pulled the results out of SG&A and included in a line under income taxes entitled loss on investment in Shred-It, net of tax. This is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and provide the pure indication of the performance of the business. Second, regarding the third quarter impact, we\u2019ve recognized a $6.8 million net loss for our third quarter or negative $0.06 per share. This negative impact was primarily due to integration costs such as IT, system converting costs and rebranding costs. In addition, Shred-It has a fairly large presence in Canada and the weakening of the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar also had a negative impact. The conversion in general though, continues to progress as planned and we are pleased with the performance of the business. We indicated in today\u2019s press release that we acquired 3.2 million shares of our common stock during the third quarter. The total cost was $251 million and the average cost per share was $78.84. This buyback had $0.01 positive impact on our third quarter EPS and we expected to benefit the fourth quarter by $0.02. As we announced on this past January of 13th, the Cintas\u2019 Board authorized a new buyback program of $500 million and that entire program remains available as of today. We also announced in today\u2019s press release that we have updated our guidance. We now expect our fiscal 2015 revenue to be in the range of $4.46 billion to $4.49 billion. We have tightened the revenue range slightly to reflect continued weakening of the Canadian dollar and for potential oil and gas related customer impact. While we did not see any noticeable revenue impact in the third quarter from our oil and gas related customer, we did began to hear from them that a negative impact is coming. On the EPS side, we now expect our fiscal 2015 earnings per diluted share guidance to be in the range of $3.55 to $3.58. When excluding the special items of the impact of the Document Shredding business and the additional gain on the Shred-it Transaction, the impact of the sale of stock in an equity investment and the impact of discontinued operations including the sale of the Document Storage and Imaging business. We expect fiscal 2015 earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $3.31 to $3.34. This EPS guidance is detailed in a table within today\u2019s press release. I will now turn the call over Paul for more details on the third quarter performance. Paul Adler : Thank you, Mike. Before moving into the third quarter results, let me remind you that there were 65 work days in this year's third quarter, which is the same as last year's third quarter. Our fourth quarter will have 65 work days, which is the same as last year's fourth quarter, for a total of 260 work days for the fiscal year. Looking ahead to next fiscal year, fiscal 2016 will have 262 work days, so two more than this year. By quarter, the work days will be 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second and third quarters and 66 in the fourth quarter. As Mike mentioned total revenue in the quarter increased 7.0% excluding last year\u2019s impact of Document Shredding. Total revenue increased organically by 7.5%. Total company gross margin was 42.9% for the third quarter of this year compared to 42.3% in last year\u2019s third quarter. The current quarter gross margin of 42.9% expanded 80 basis points from last year\u2019s third quarter gross margin of 42.1% adjusted to exclude Document Shredding. Total company energy related expenses for this year\u2019s third quarter were 2.4%. Last year\u2019s third quarter energy related expenses were 3.2%, but excluding Document Management they were 3.0%. I\u2019ll discuss gross margin and energy related expenses by business in just a moment. Before doing so, let me remind you that we have three reportable operating segments : Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services. Uniform Direct Sales and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services are combined and presented as other services on the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consist of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restaurant supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue was $859.5 million, which is up 7.2% compared to last year's third quarter. Organic growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency changes, was 7.8%. Organic growth was higher than total growth because of the continued weakening of the Canadian dollar. We did not see any noticeable third quarter revenue effect from oil and gas related customers, but as Mike mentioned, these customers businesses did begin to feel the impact of the low oil prices in the later part of the quarter. Aside from the oil and gas related customers, we saw no marketable change to net add stops in the third quarter. Our Rental segment gross margin was 44.6% for the third quarter, an increase from 43.9% in last year's third quarter. Most of these improvements came from energy related costs, which were 70 basis points lower than in last year\u2019s third quarter. The third quarter Rental Segment gross margin of 44.6% was a slight decrease from this fiscal year\u2019s second quarter gross margin of 44.8%. Energy related costs in the third quarter were 20 basis points lower than in this fiscal year\u2019s second quarter. Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue for the third quarter was $112.2 million, an increase of 4.2% compared to last year's third quarter. When adjusting for foreign currency changes, organic growth was 4.8%. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 27.7% for the third quarter, a slight improvement from last year's third quarter gross margin of 27.5% and this year\u2019s second quarter gross margin of 27.6%. Both of these improvements are mostly due to lower energy related expenses. Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training, and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue for the third quarter was $137.1 million, which was 8.2% higher than last year's third quarter. Organic growth was 7.5%. We continue to be very pleased with this business. Third quarter organic growth came down some from previous quarters due to fewer repair jobs on the fire protection side of the business and due to the severe winter weather in the Northeast. This segment\u2019s gross margin was 44.3% in the third quarter, an improvement of 80 basis points compared to last year\u2019s third quarter gross margin of 43.5%. Energy related costs were 60 basis points lower than last year\u2019s third quarter. The third quarter gross margin of 44.3% was an improvement over this fiscal year\u2019s second quarter gross margin of 43.8%. Energy-related costs accounted for 40 basis points of the improvement. Switching to selling and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 27.2% as a percentage of third quarter revenue, compared to a total company SG&A in last year's third quarter of 28.6%. When excluding the impact that document shredding had on last year's third quarter SG&A and revenue, last year's adjusted total company SG&A was 27.8% as a percentage of the adjusted revenue. On our second quarter call, we indicated that our risk management claims experience was better than the previous year and that better experience continued into our third quarter. Keep in mind however that we are self-insured. In addition to risk management and number of minor improvements were realized in other expense categories. The third quarter SG&A of 27.2% was a 50 basis point increase, compared to the 26.7% in this fiscal year\u2019s second quarter. As we mentioned on the second quarter call, payroll taxes reset in our third quarter. This expected increase was partially offset by a number of minor improvements in other expenses. Our effective tax rate was 36.2% for the quarter, compared to 36.7% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. We expect the fiscal 2015 effective rate to be 37.3%. Our cash and marketable securities were $490 million at February 28, a decrease of $337 million from the $827 million at November 30th. This decrease is due to paying the $202 million dividend in early December and the execution of the $251 million share buyback during the third quarter, partially offsets by cash generated from our operating cash flows. Accounts receivable decreased $12 million since November 30th, due to the timing of collections. New goods inventory and in-service inventory levels at February 28th were relatively consistent with November 30th balances. Accounts payable increased roughly $27 million since November 30th, due to the timing of vendor payment due dates. Current accrued liabilities decreased by $221 million since November 30th, due largely to the payments of the accrued dividend, which was paid in December. Long-term debt remained at $1.3 billion, representing 1.6 times EBITDA. And finally, CapEx for the third quarter was about $50 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows : $43 million in Rental, $2 million in Uniform Direct Sales, and $5 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of $220 million to $250 million. That concludes our prepared remarks and we\u2019ll now be glad to answer any of your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman : It\u2019s Andrew. I definitely appreciate you\u2019re kind of talking about oil clients upfront because you\u2019d be asking anyhow. But my question is when you look at your percentage exposure to oil clients, has it changed since you talk about those in late December and whey you say that you\u2019ve allowed for some room for easing with your oil clients into fourth quarter, how much is this going to move the kind of fourth quarter organic number like is this a big deal or you\u2019re just trying to kind of communicate one small piece of the business? Mike Hansen : Andrew, we knew that we would get out this question, so we\u2019re trying to anticipate a little bit. The magnitude of those oil and gas customers has not changed since the second quarter, so it\u2019s still in the lower single-digits. And when we think about the fourth quarter, more of the impacts based on our guidance movement is due to the Canadian dollar, but there will be a little bit of an impact from the oil and gas customers. We have started to hear from them that they are reducing workforce to some extent. But like I said the impact is within our guidance and the amount of those customers hasn\u2019t really changed. Andrew Steinerman : Great. And just \u2013 the business even if they reduce people, I mean the uniform rental business doesn\u2019t move quickly so I could try \u2013 again maybe I will try one more time, do you think that the oil and gas clients pulling back might move your organic rental number 10, 20 basis points? Or is that higher given the low single-digit exposure overall? Mike Hansen : Well, I think it will be a relatively small move. And while we \u2013 I hesitate to give too many specifics, but I think it certainly is going to be less than a percentage point of impact in the fourth quarter. Now, the other thing I would say Andrew is we\u2019re in the midst of this impact and we\u2019re hearing from customers making moves on a daily basis if you will. And so, it\u2019s a little bit hard to peg it exactly. We do think certainly that it\u2019s within our guidance. As we get into fiscal 2016, we\u2019ll certainly have to continue to evaluate how this moves and speak to that in July, but again it\u2019s not \u2013 it is a relatively small portion of our overall revenue. Andrew Steinerman : I appreciate. Mike, let me try one more time. So 95 plus percent of your business continues to be strong, right. Mike Hansen : Yes. Andrew Steinerman : Okay, thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with RBC. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good afternoon, this is [indiscernible] for Gary, not to continue along the oil and gas exposure, but I think you guys mentioned last quarter some of the pricing pushback potentially from customers regarding lower fuel prices. Is that tended to materialize in the quarter and any comment on that? Mike Hansen : Our pricing environment in the third quarter was relatively the same as the second quarter. So we didn\u2019t see much of a change, I think what we had signaled last quarter was that look as we \u2013 as those customers start to feel the impact of the lower oil prices, conversations about pricing may be a little bit more difficult. But we did not see a dramatic change in the pricing environment in the third quarter. Unidentified Analyst : Fair enough thanks. And I guess in terms of the \u2013 add-stop metric, I guess any kind of commentary around that and any more color just regarding, I guess, in the overall context of the job market here? Mike Hansen : Well we, as Paul said, we didn\u2019t see a noticeable change in the net add-stops number and that\u2019s as you\u2019ve probably heard from us that\u2019s been relatively consistent over the last several years. And I think the impact of net add-stops on a quarter specific basis is just not that large and that\u2019s the way it is been for the last-gasp five years and that\u2019s what we saw in the quarter, just not much of an impact. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. Mike Hansen : We certainly love to see our customers begin to hire at a higher rate and feel the impact of that, but we didn\u2019t see that in the third quarter. Unidentified Analyst : Fair enough. And then I guess in terms of these Shred-It impact are you guys wanted to disclose, I guess what potential impact that could be on fiscal 2016 estimates or any whether it\u2019s going to be material for your guys or kind of expected impact from that? Mike Hansen : Well I will tell you, a year ago when we closed that transaction, we certainly with Shred-It put together a business plan and that business plan included certain performance expectations, certain synergies, certain integration costs. And that I would say that that integration is going as expected and we continue to be happy with that business. But because we are in the midst of that integration process, the results and the cost of those re branding efforts and IT conversion efforts are little bit unpredictable right now. And so we are not prepared to give really much of a forecast for the fourth quarter and certainly not for our fiscal 2016. As we get into fiscal 2016, that may change, but we need to see more of the integration be completed before we\u2019re going to be ready to give forecasts. Unidentified Analyst : Great and if I could sneak one more, and I guess could you guys comment, I guess on the M&A pipeline and kind of the activity levels there and, I guess, if the valuations are increasingly higher for you guys in the context around that would be great, thanks. Mike Hansen : Sure, we do have an active pipeline were we are constantly looking for opportunities in that area. I would say that evaluations are generally fairly high, but we\u2019re certainly willing and looking for opportunities in that area. Even though nothing significant is close we\u2019re still that is a great use of our cash and we\u2019re still looking for those opportunities. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks so much. Mike Hansen : Sure. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Greg Bisbee : Hi, this is actually Greg calling on for Manav. I was just hoping you add a little bit more color on the weather impact for this quarter. I know the weather is pretty bad last year, just want to see how much for tailwind that actually was for the quarter? Paul Adler : I would not say that it was a tailwind for the quarter. Last year, you are correct, last year the winter was fairly severe and it really affected our document management business more than any other business. It also tends to affect our first aid and safety and fire business a little bit more. And so I wouldn\u2019t call that a tailwind for this quarter because yes obviously we don\u2019t have the document management results and we had some weather issues this quarter in first aid safely and fire as well. Greg Bisbee : Okay. And then I guess on document sales here [indiscernible] some of the tough comps, can be a little bit lumpy but this mid single-digit range that you had is that a reasonable expectation for what you are thinking about that business and what it can do? Paul Adler : I am sorry you are talking about the document management business. Greg Bisbee : I am sorry, Direct sales \u2013 Uniform Direct Sales. Paul Adler : Uniform Direct Sales, all right. Greg Bisbee : Sorry for that. Paul Adler : That\u2019s a very good business for us and we do believe that it can grow in the mid single-digits. We want to make sure that we\u2019re selling the right accounts and profitable accounts. We aren\u2019t interested in selling commodity direct sale of uniforms but we do believe that can grow in the mid single-digits. Greg Bisbee : Okay. Paul Adler : But as you say it is a bumpy ride with that business. Greg Bisbee : Okay. And just one more from me on the CapEx guidance trending well there, is that being pushed out fiscal 2016 or is that kind of, you\u2019re realizing that you don\u2019t need to do quite as much or how should we think about that? Mike Hansen : I would say that the processing capacity that we spoke off in the first half of the year is getting pushed into next fiscal year. We still have some SAP spending. As you know, we\u2019re in the midst of the SAP projects for rental. And we\u2019ll see a little bit of that get pushed into next year as well. Greg Bisbee : Okay, thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from George Tong with Piper Jaffray. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is [indiscernible] calls on for George Tong. I just wanted to touch on Uniform Rentals and see if you can give us a little more color on what\u2019s really driving growth there, is it new customers, is it better pricing, give us a little more color on that. Mike Hansen : Sure, it\u2019s \u2013 I would say that it\u2019s a same thing that\u2019s been driving for the last several quarters and that is good new business sales, so new customers. It is penetration of existing customers with additional products and services and certainly pricing has helped this fiscal year as well. We\u2019ve talked about the pricing environment being more positive this fiscal year than compared to last fiscal year, so that\u2019s certainly has helped us well. So it\u2019s a combination of the three of those. Unidentified Analyst : Great. And touching back on CapEx, I know you were planning to build up some new facilities to expand your production capabilities or your processing facilities. I just wanted to see if there is any update on those plans? Mike Hansen : We still are actively working on those plans. As I have mentioned that the actual spending has been pushed \u2013 will get pushed into next fiscal year, but we still do need some capacity in certain areas and we\u2019ll be moving forward with those plans next fiscal year. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thanks for the color. Mike Hansen : Sure. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Andy Whitman with Robert W Baird. Andy Whitman : Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Like I just wanted to understand the \u2013 some of the impacts of Shred-it here and maybe the first thing is a definitional question in your guidance. You mentioned that Shred-it \u2013 your guidance excludes \u2013 assumes I think you said considers no contribution from Shred-it. Is that saying that you expected to be EPS neutral or are you saying Shred-it is going to do what it\u2019s going to do and you\u2019re not considering that in how you\u2019re guiding. And the reason why I ask this is for the quarter obviously it had a \u2013 I guess a negative $0.06 impact and previously my working assumption was that Shred-it was going to be EPS neutral. So I guess this restructuring but thought that was contemplated. Was what you saw in Shred-it unexpected for you or where you guiding exclusive of Shred-it from the get-go? Mike Hansen : We\u2019ve been guidance exclusive of Shred-it. We that integration \u2013 while it continues as expected, it can be a little bit unpredictable in terms of when this spend happens and so we\u2019re just not prepared to give good guidance on a quarter-by-quarter basis. We do really believe that synergy opportunities are being achieved and will continue to be achieved and we really do believe that \u2013 that it will be additive to us. But we\u2019re in a little bit of a period of unpredictability and hesitant to give any kind of guidance as a result. Andy Whitman : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Is it even meaningful to try to get the quarterly breakdown, now that you\u2019ve pulled the Shred-it contribution out of the SG&A and put it on its own line, would you be comfortable giving that and even if you did can we make anything of it? Mike Hansen : Sure it will. I mean the quarter itself was $6.8 million and prior to this in the second quarter, I believe it was roughly $300,000 of a net expense, in the first quarter, because in our first quarter we were so close to the transaction date, that there weren\u2019t a lot of integration activities happening. Andy Whitman : Yes, Okay, all that is helpful. I think \u2013 that\u2019s it, I think all I have for this time. Thanks. Mike Hansen : Okay. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Faton Begolli with Merrill Lynch Bank of America. Faton Begolli : Hi, this is Faton Begolli calling in for Sara Gubins. So my first question is on the SMP implementation. Could you update us on the role out of that and what benefits you are seeing? Mike Hansen : Well, we are in a very early stages and so that the early stage is mean we are \u2013 we\u2019re still building the system, we expect to be able to pilot that system, probably something early fiscal 2017 and if all goes well, then we\u2019ll start to see a roll out some time in fiscal 2017 and continuing into fiscal 2018. So we\u2019ll start to see the depreciation of that system, partially in 2017, probably if all goes well, a full year in 2018 and really want to start to see the benefit until we get to that point. So we haven\u2019t seen any benefit of it yet nor have we seen any real expense yet. Faton Begolli : I see, okay. Thank you and you also mentioned no change in add-stops. We had a point where we \u2013 where you would expect growth there or what would it take a expect growth in that metric? Mike Hansen : Well it certainly would take our customers hiring at a more accelerated pace. When we think about the jobs, certainly the headlines are looking better and that is good news. We just haven\u2019t seen that translate to net add-stops yet. Keeping in mind that the last several months are seasonally adjusted and so it gives a little bit difficult to equate the BLS information to our net add-stops. But we just haven\u2019t seen yet and we need to see our customers more rapidly hire. Faton Begolli : I see, okay. So switching gears to a potential acquisition, so giving your recent performance and your recent operating results, would you expand the countries outside of the U.S. few acquisition. Is that in your plan? Mike Hansen : Well we \u2013 I would say that our first priority and our first preference would be to acquire businesses that are in our existing businesses within the U.S. and Canada. As certainly we will get the most value and synergies out of those kind of acquisition opportunities. Having said that, if we were able to find the right acquisitions internationally and in the right businesses we certainly would take a look at those. But as you probably seen from Cintas over the years, we would likely be a little bit more cautious about that. But our preference is acquisition opportunities in our existing businesses in the U.S and Canada. Faton Begolli : Got it. Thanks. Okay, so my last question is just a housekeeping question, what do you expect for a share count for the end of the year? Mike Hansen : I would \u2013 we are expecting something around $119 million. Faton Begolli : Okay, that is all I have, thank you. Mike Hansen : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : We will take our next question from Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Nate Brochmann : Good evening, everyone. Mike Hansen : Hi, Nate. Nate Brochmann : So I want to follow-up a little bit on the add-stop metric and I know we haven\u2019t really seen an increase in I know that we kind of been fluctuating from neutral, maybe the slightly positive and even sometime slightly negative. But if we were to assume that maybe at some point that starts getting moving, would there be anything in the cost structure or anything in terms of just utilization or capacity at a point that we\u2019d have to add so significantly that we could not at least for a period of time recognize maybe some historical relationships between the increase in the add-stop and then incremental gross margins that would get associated with that route density? Mike Hansen : Well, if we saw a rapid pick up in adds, so keeping in mind, we would likely have some additional material cost when a customer adds a new employee. We will go to our stockroom where we have existing garments and we\u2019ll pull as many of those existing garments as we can and those are already in our cost structure. However, there are times due to size, differences, et cetera, where we may have to order some new garments as well. So there is a little bit of an incremental material cost impact. We then have to wash those instead of those garments sitting in our stockroom, we have to wash those garments and sort them. But then from a service standpoint, we\u2019re already going to that customer, we\u2019re already delivering and there really isn\u2019t any additional cost there. So it is a very accretive kind of business and its great business and we love to see more of it. Would we get enough net add-stops to dramatically affect our capacity where we\u2019d have to really see some significant hiring in order to do that. So, we\u2019d have to have a lot of net add-stops affecting one or two or a few locations and that\u2019s unlikely. Nate Brochmann : Okay, and yes that\u2019s helpful. And then second \u2013 and I don\u2019t know if there is anything that you can really share, but obviously you\u2019ve been very successful over the last several years in terms of adding some new services, anything new in the pipeline that we can talk about or anything else in terms of that incremental in terms of the extra cross-selling opportunity? Mike Hansen : Well, we\u2019re certainly always working on new products and services, no question about it. We are still working hard to penetration as many customers as possible with our Carhartt program. We\u2019ve talked about Scrub Rental program and our chemicals. And those are still selling very, very well and the growth rates are still very good. I\u2019m not ready to talk about any new items, but the really nice thing about our business is we\u2019ve got close to a million customers that we\u2019re seeing generally on a weekly or monthly basis and that relationship and that frequency create some good opportunities for us. And so we\u2019re always looking and we\u2019re currently working on ways to improve \u2013 not improve but increase the amount of products and services with each of them. Nate Brochmann : Sounds good, I appreciate the time. I\u2019ll turn that over. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. Good afternoon. I\u2019m curious on new wins and penetration. Just curious any commentary on end market themes that you\u2019re seeing there where the strength is coming from for the most part? Mike Hansen : You know the theme that we\u2019ve talked about over the last years or may be a couple of years is that healthcare is becoming a more and more important vertical for us as we create more products for that verticals such as the Scrub Rental Program, such as Microfiber mops and wipes. It is becoming more important for us and that\u2019s been a nice vertical. I would say that really nothing other \u2013 no other verticals that really top out as being a big change to us. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks and I think that\u2019s been covered pretty well, but I just ask it one more time just to drive it home. In the oil and gas end market, you\u2019re saying low single-digit exposure that\u2019s what it was last quarter that\u2019s what it is this quarter. Was it about the same going back a year or 18 months ago? And then what I\u2019m getting at is \u2013 is that come on strong this year or has that been pretty stable for the past couple of years? Mike Hansen : Well, the oil and gas vertical requires a lot of fire resisting clothing. And so, I would say over really the last five years, it\u2019s been a very nice vertical for us. We have had a lot success and the industry has had a lot of success selling fire resisting clothing to them. I would say that it hasn\u2019t been a change to us though. It\u2019s been fairly consistent and a good growth vertical for us for a number of years. I would say if you go back 10 years, Scott, probably less revenue in that area than today. Scott Schneeberger : Excellent, thanks. And one more from me, I think it\u2019s pretty clear, but just would love to get your perspective on the increase in the guidance. How much of it was relative to the internal expectation for the fiscal third quarter? How much was contribution from share repurchase that\u2019s been done recently and just other puts and takes [indiscernible] or a bridge is essentially what I\u2019m looking for? Thanks. Mike Hansen : Well, the share buyback was $0.03, $0.01 in the third quarter and we expect $0.02 in the fourth quarter. I would say a lot of the guidance and we\u2019re \u2013 I\u2019m speaking to EPS was because of the good results in the third quarter certainly. And it just reflects our expectation for the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve been at a pretty good operating margin for the year. I think Bill and I talked a little bit about that being relatively consistent throughout the year and I wouldn\u2019t expect to change from that now. Scott Schneeberger : Great. Thanks for the color. Mike Hansen : Sure. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Joe Box : Hi, good afternoon guys. Mike Hansen : Hi, Joe. Joe Box : So, Mike, I think you mentioned earlier in your prepared remarks that you do expect operating leverage from density gains. I\u2019m just curious should we think about that statement as maybe being status quo versus you\u2019d previously expected from density or are there maybe some bigger benefits out in front of us as you implement your SAP system and maybe we could be looking at continued above trend incremental margins? Mike Hansen : I think the \u2013 our guidance would start to suggest that when you think about our third and fourth quarter of last fiscal year, we had some very healthy incremental margins. From a rental standpoint, the operating margin was close to 50% in the second half of the year, the incremental opportunity margins. It\u2019s hard to keep that rate going for long periods of time, but we do still believe that that we can have very good incremental margins because we\u2019ve got quite an infrastructure around the U.S. and Canada and we can continue to add products and services to our customers and some of those are not \u2013 some of the revenues that we\u2019re getting is not processed, so we\u2019re not really using any processing capacity. So we think there is still a certainly our good incremental margin opportunities as we move forward. Having said that at the 50% clip that that\u2019s pretty hard to sustain over long periods of time. Joe Box : Of course, I appreciate that. Thanks Mike. And just maybe one quick one on Shred-it, I appreciate the commentary you\u2019ve given us so far, but I do want to try to understand maybe where we\u2019re at from an integration standpoint, really just to help us with our model. Can you just give us a sense of maybe what inning you think you\u2019re in as you\u2019re integrating these two companies? Are you guys just scratching the surface on re-branding on IT and route consolidation? Or do you think you\u2019re maybe in mid or late innings? Mike Hansen : I would say that that we\u2019ve passed the 50% mark and so we\u2019re probably in that third quarter of the integration. Joe Box : Thank you that \u2013 that\u2019s helpful. And then just one last oil and gas question, I\u2019m not really curious about the top line impact, but I do want to ask on working capital. If you do start to see some assets come back to you, could you possibly re-deploy those into other markets like construction or petrochemical or are they all pretty industry specific? Mike Hansen : Well, it certainly would be customer by customer, but we can use fire resistant clothing in other industries besides oil and gas. Anything that\u2019s got kind of a flash fire opportunity can \u2013 will need fire resisting clothing and there are lots of opportunities for those. So they\u2019re not quite as broad as our general work wear uniform, but there are other opportunities except for certain customers, who have very specific garments that that we would have an inventory liability protection on. Joe Box : And do you think we would notice it in the working capital line or is it too small? Mike Hansen : I don\u2019t think it would be noticeable, no. Joe Box : Okay, thanks guys, nice quarter. Mike Hansen : Thanks. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Adams [Indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys this is Adam [Indiscernible] on for John Healy. Great job on the quarter. Mike Hansen : Thank you. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, I was wondering if you guys could help us out with the SG&A line, it was impressive again this quarter. I was hoping you could guide us about that line item moving forward into 2016 from a modeling standpoint? Mike Hansen : I am sorry, is it Adam? Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Mike Hansen : Adams, we\u2019re not prepared right now to give fiscal 2016 guidance. I would tell you that that we do believe that we can continue to get leverage in the SG&A area, but not prepared right now to give 2016 information. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thanks guys. Good quarter. Mike Hansen : Thanks. Paul Adler : Thanks. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. Mr. Adler, Mr. Hansen, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. Mike Hansen : Well, thank you very much for joining us tonight. As a reminder, we\u2019ll be issuing our fourth quarter earnings in mid July. So we look forward to speaking with you at that time. Good evening. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Nate Brochmann - William Blair Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer Andrew Wittmann - Robert W. Baird Manav Patnaik - Barclays Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus Operator : Good day everyone and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Hansen : Thank you and good evening. Thanks for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas Vice President and treasurer. We will discuss our fourth quarter and full year results for fiscal 2015. In addition, we will provide guidance for fiscal 2016 and after our commentary we will be happy to answer any questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. As we reported today, in today's press release, our results for continuing operations adjusted to exclude all impacts of the document management businesses and the first quarter benefit from the gain on the sale of stock in an equity method investment are more representative of our ongoing performance. Therefore our discussion of the Company's performance will exclude these items. We are pleased to report fourth quarter revenue of $1.142 billion. Organic revenue growth which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency and the Shred-it transaction was 6% for the quarter. Full fiscal year revenue was $4.476 billion representing organic growth of 7.1% over the prior fiscal year. While revenue in our Uniform Direct Sales segment was unchanged compared to fiscal 2014, our two largest segments, Rental Uniforms and First Aid, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection grew organically for the year by 7.7% and 9.2% respectively. The performance of our sales force in both businesses were strong. We saw profitable business and penetrated existing customers with our broad line of products and services. Fourth quarter operating income was $177 million which was 15.6% of revenue compared to an adjusted operating margin of 15.4% in the prior year. Full fiscal year operating income was $696 million or 15.6% of revenue. This represents a 120 basis point improvement over last year's adjusted operating margin. We are pleased with our ability to leverage our infrastructure and with the results of our increased focus on managing our cost structure following the Shred-it transaction. Additionally, we benefited from lower energy-related costs compared to last year. Paul will discuss the energy-related costs in more detail. Earnings per diluted share as adjusted for the fourth quarter were $0.86 representing an increase of 11.7% over last year. For the full fiscal year EPS was $3.35, an increase of 21.8% over last year. As our CEO, Scott Farmer stated in today's press release, we also demonstrated our continuing commitment to providing shareholder value through our stock buyback program. We purchased 4.4 million shares of our common stock during the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of fiscal '16 for $370 million. Fiscal 2015 was a very successful year for Cintas. We thank our employees, whom we call partners for their hard work in ensuring this outcome. Yesterday, the Company announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its investment in Shred-it for approximately $550 million to $600 million before taxes. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2015 subject to obtaining regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. These proceeds will be in addition to the $180 million received at the closing of the partnership transaction on April 30, 2014 and the $113 million received in May 2015 in the form of a dividend from Shred-it. Looking forward to fiscal 2016, we expect revenue to be in the range of $4.700 billion to $4.780 billion. We also expect double-digit EPS growth in the range of $3.74 to $3.83. This guidance includes the impact of having two more workdays in fiscal '16 compared to fiscal '15. Our guidance does not include any EPS impact from the recently announced agreement to sell our investment in Shred-it nor does it include any deterioration in the U.S. economy or any additional share buybacks. The EPS guidance is detailed in a table within today's press release. I'll now turn the call over to Paul for more details on Company performance. Paul Adler : Thanks Mike. First, please note that there were 65 work days in this year's fourth quarter which is the same as last year's fourth quarter. Full fiscal year of 2015 had the same number of days as fiscal 2014 of 260 days. Fiscal year 2016 will have 262 work days, two more than fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016 the number of work days by quarter are 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second and third quarters and 66 in the fourth quarter. As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.0% in the fourth quarter and by 7.1% for the full fiscal year. Total Company gross margin was 42.6% for the fourth quarter of this year compared to 42.2% in last year's fourth quarter as adjusted. Total Company energy-related expenses for this year's fourth quarter were 2.2%. Last year's fourth quarter energy-related expenses were 3.0% excluding document management. For the full year total Company gross margin was 42.9% an increase of 120 basis points over the prior year adjusted margin of 41.7%. For the full year total Company energy-related expenses of 2.5% or 40 basis points lower than fiscal 2014 as adjusted to exclude document management. I will discuss gross margin and energy-related expenses by segments in just a moment. Before doing so, let me remind you that we have three reportable operating segments, rental uniforms and ancillary products, uniform direct sales and first aid, safety and fire protection services. Uniform Direct Sales and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services are combined and presented as other services on the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and ancillary products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels, and other related items. The segment also includes restaurant supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue was $873 million an increase of 5.8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth which excludes the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes was 6.5%. Organic growth was higher than total growth because of continued weakening of the Canadian dollar. For the full year rental segment total road and organic growth were 7.2% and 7.7% respectively. Rental segment revenue mix for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was unchanged from the prior year quarter. The revenue mix was as follows : uniform rental accounted for approximately 52% of revenue. Loss control comprised mainly of entrance mats accounted for 19%, hygiene and other services including restaurant supply, cleaning services and chemical services were 16% of revenue. Shop [ph] towels were 5% and linen and others which is mainly nonperson specific garments such as aprons and butcher coats was 8%. Our Rental segment gross margin was 44.0% for the fourth quarter, an increase from 43.6% in last year's fourth quarter. Energy-related costs were 90 basis points lower than our last year's fourth quarter. For the year Rental segment gross margin was 44.6% an increase of 130 basis points compared to the prior year, about 50 basis points of which was due to lower energy-related costs. Our Uniform Direct Sales operating statement included the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers including product sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue for the fourth quarter was $118 million an increase of 0.3% compared to last year's fourth quarter. When adjusting for foreign currency exchange rate changes organic growth was 1.1% for the quarter and flat for the full fiscal year. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 29.8% for the fourth quarter compared to 30.0% in the prior year quarter. For both the full fiscal years of 2015 and 2014 gross margin was 28.5%. The decrease in energy-related costs benefitted gross margins 30 basis points and 10 basis points in the fourth quarter and full-year periods respectfully. Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Service operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue for the fourth quarter was $150 million which was 9.8% higher than last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was 7.3%. For the full-year segment total growth and organic growth was 10.5% and 9.2% respectively. This segment's gross margin was 44.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 44.6% in the prior year. Energy-related costs were 60 basis points lower than in last year's fourth quarter. For the year First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection segment gross margin was 44.1% an increase of 30 basis points compared to the prior year. Energy-related costs were 40 basis points lower than fiscal 2014. Regarding selling, and general and administrative expenses, total Company SG&A was 27.0% as a percentage of fourth quarter revenue compared to a total Company SG&A and last year's fourth quarter of 27.8%. When excluding the impact that document shredding had on last year's fourth quarter SG&A and revenue, last year's adjusted total Company SG&A were 26.8% as a percentage of the adjusted revenue. We had an increase in legal and professional expenses in the fourth quarter. Full year SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 27.4% for fiscal 2015, the same percentage as in fiscal 2014 when adjusted for document shredding. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 37.6% compared to 40.4% in the prior year period. The full year 2015 effective tax rate was 37.2% compared to 38.3% in fiscal 2014. The higher fiscal 2014 effective tax rate was the result of a number of discrete items related to the Shred-it transaction. We expect the fiscal 2016 effective tax rate to be 37.3%. Our cash and marketable securities were $433 million at May 31, an increase of $30 million from the $403 million at February 28. Cash provided by operating activities was $202 million in the fiscal fourth quarter driven by net income and increases in working capital resulting from the timing of vendor and other payments compared to the previous quarter. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 we received a dividend from Shred-it of $113 million. And finally, the company paid $237 million in the fourth quarter to repurchased common stock. Capital Expenditures for the fourth quarter were $54 million. Our CapEx by operating segments was as follows : [Indiscernible] $4 million in rental, 3 million in uniform direct sales, and $7 million in first aid, safety and fire protection. We expect for fiscal 2016 in the range of $250 million to $300 million. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from George Tong from Piper Jaffray. Adrian Paz : Hi this is Adrian Paz on for George Tong. And I want to I guess driving to the rental uniform segment and there has been a bit of deceleration there from prior quarters. Maybe you can touch on trends that you are seeing there that contributed to the deceleration there? And also I want to know if you are maybe seeing softness from the manufacturing sector due to the stronger dollar? Mike Hansen : Sure, so our rental organic growth, it did come down a bit from the third quarter to the fourth quarter and there were several things that accounted for that. First of all we did see a little bit of softening in our net add-stops performance, a little pullback from our customers. I would say in the middle of the quarter we started to see a little bit of a worsening trend and that actually continued into our first quarter. We also a little bit of a pull back from our national account customers, especially in our emergency services business. We saw a little bit of a negative impact from the oil and gas that we\u2019ve talked about in the past, and then lastly I would say, we did see a little bit of an impact from pricing from the standpoint of the year-over-year impact. So let me talk a bit about pricing. Last year, in the fourth quarter we talked about how we saw an improvement in the pricing environment and that carried throughout our fiscal 2015. And we really didn\u2019t see much of a change in our fourth quarter, but one thing to keep in mind is, we did lap the beginning of that what we saw was a bit of an improved environment. So the year-over-year growth was affected by a little bit. So I would say those four things contributed to a little bit of a deceleration in that rental organic growth. From a manufacturing segment standpoint I can\u2019t say that we saw anything unusual or any significant trend or noticeable trend. Adrian Paz : Hey great. Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. And I guess can you touch on, I guess your capital allocation plans with divestiture or the sale of the Shred-it transaction, it seems like you guys have a really strong balance sheet at this point. Maybe you could touch on what you are \u2013 if you are looking at any particular segment for M&A plans in general? Mike Hansen : Well, so certainly when we think about our cash usage we want to make sure that we\u2019re growing organically and we\u2019ll spend what we need to on CapEx. Secondly, we really do like acquisition opportunities if they are at the right value and they create synergies and long-term benefits for the Company. We certainly would be actively involved in looking at acquiring business in our current businesses if the value was there, if we felt like synergies were available. And so we certainly have an active corporate development team and certainly are open to making acquisitions again that are at the right value and that can provide long-term value for us. Certainly after that, we\u2019ve shown that we will increase the dividend. We\u2019ve done so every year since we went public in 1983 and so dividends are an important part of our capital allocation. And then lastly as you\u2019ve seen in the last quarter or so, the buyback program in very important to us and as we mentioned we acquired $370 million of our stock in the last quarter and into the first quarter. So when we think about capital allocation, those are thoughts. Now certainly, with the Shred-it transaction, that will close in the fourth quarter, our board will be busy thinking about how to deploy that cash, what\u2019s the appropriate way to use that and we\u2019ll certainly be actively thinking in terms of how to use that. Adrian Paz : And looking at perhaps your M&A pipeline, are you really looking for larger transactions or are you happy with maybe just bolt-on opportunities? Mike Hansen : We would look at both bold-ons. We certainly love bold-ons because they create some great synergies for us. But we certainly would be open to larger transactions again as long as they created a value that we felt like we needed, the synergy opportunities and long-term value for Cintas. Adrian Paz : Great, thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Greg Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Greg Bisbee : Hi, guys, good afternoon. Mike Hansen : Hi, Greg. Greg Bisbee : A couple questions, if I could. The first aid, fire safety organic growth slowed a little more and my sense coming out of last quarter\u2019s call was that there has been a little weather impact that may be would bounce back, is there anything more specific you\u2019d fall out and any thought process in how that might trend given this recent period of deterioration organic growth? Thank you. Mike Hansen : Yes. We are still pleased with the performance of the business. On the fire side of that business, there does tend to be a little bit more project work and we did see a little bit of pull back in that project work in the fourth quarter. So there are repairs that we do, there are new product sales like fire extinguisher sales to customers and we saw a little bit of pull back in the fourth quarter nothing that we believe to be creating a trend. We still feel very positive particularly about the service side of the business. It's been performing very well. So I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen in the business in the last quarter, but in our minds nothing to be concerned about. Greg Bisbee : Okay. And then on the gross margins, it looks like both rentals and first aid if you back out the benefit from energy would have seen a gross margin decline somewhat year-over-year that's obliviously change from what\u2019s been a real strong trend for quite some time. Is there anything in particular going on there? I guess comps probably won\u2019t really be, but are you spending more, is there anything else and I guess how do we think about that flowing into your guidance for next year? Mike Hansen : Yes I think, first let me say, we feel like we had a great year in those businesses where the gross margin in rental went up about a 130 basis points, in first aid it went up about 30 basis points. We continue to invest in both businesses and I think in the fourth quarter, we saw a little bit may be of pulling repair and maintenance into the fourth quarter that may have happened in the first quarter. I think we started hiring a little bit early for the businesses, on the Ralphs [ph] particularly. So we added Ralphs maybe a little bit more aggressively in both businesses than we have and probably just setting the table for fiscal 2016. So, as we think about the guidance I would say we still believe that there is gross margin opportunity. We think incremental margins are going to be healthy. As it relates to our rental business we've talked a little bit during fiscal 2015 about pushing some capacity growth into fiscal 2016 that goes into our guidance thinking a little bit. And the other thing is, when we \u2013 from the standpoint of energy so gas fuel prices for us, we\u2019ve included an expectation, that fuel prices for the year would be about the same in fiscal 2016 as in fiscal 2015. Both years would be about 2.5%. On the flip side though, as I mentioned from a rental organic growth standpoint we did see a little bit of negative impact from our oil and gas customers in the fourth quarter and we\u2019ve also included in our guidance into fiscal 2016 that that kind of performance would continue as long as we see the fuel in that 2.5% range. And so the point is on a net basis, while we got a benefit certainly in fiscal 2015 from net, oil and gas in the fuel costs, we think it might turn around a little bit in fiscal 2016. Greg Bisbee : That sounds prudent and then just one other one. I assume you have a pretty good sense of what your cost based for the shredding businesses, so should we think of taxes eating up a big piece of those proceeds or is it fairly minor and I guess I\u2019d say the same for the dividends? Mike Hansen : Yes. So we\u2019ve got a fairly complex transaction. So we\u2019re going to be working on taxes up to the point of time that we close that transaction. But as of May 31, our book value was $219 million and that came down because of the dividend. So we have to record that dividend as a reduction in our book value of our investment. So you can kind of think of the cash that we received, let\u2019s call it the midpoint of 575 compared to a book value of as of May 31, 2019 that\u2019s a $350-ish million gain and so we\u2019ll pay taxes on that gain and probably an easy way to think about that at the moment is using our 37.3% against that. One thing from a cash standpoint to keep in mind is that the gain we recognized a year ago was a deferred tax gain, so we didn\u2019t pay taxes on that piece of the gain, so we\u2019ll have to do that as well when we receive the cash at closing. Does that make sense? So I would say it is going to be a fairly good sized tax bill, but we'll have a lot of cash left over. And we\u2019ll certainly provide more details as we get through those calculations and we firm up the amount of the proceeds. Greg Bisbee : Perfect, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Sara Gubins from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sara Gubins : Hi, thank you good afternoon. Mike Hansen : Hi Sara. Sara Gubins : A couple of questions about guidance, could you help us think about how much of a benefit from the Shred-it JV is in your fiscal guidance? Mike Hansen : Yes, as Paul mentioned there is no benefit in the fiscal 2016 guidance as it relates to Shred-it. Sara Gubins : So, yeah. Paul Adler : So let me make a couple of points on that. We are going to continue to own 42% of Shred-it until that transaction closes. So roughly for the first half of the year we will record our share of the Shred-it income just like we did in fiscal 2015. We, because of the transaction and you probably had seen that there was an IPO process as well. We didn\u2019t \u2013 we just didn\u2019t have clarity on what that performance might look like and so we\u2019ve not included any impact from the Shred-it net income performance that we will share in and then once we haven\u2019t received the cash yet. We need to close that deal first and until we do that we\u2019re not ready to provide any other guidance on how that cash may impact us. One thing about the first particularly the first quarter as it relates to our share of the Shred-it income they have the IPO process going as well as this transaction that we announced yesterday and there will likely be a fair amount of transaction related expenses that we will share in. Now, when we record that, when we record our share of those expenses in the first quarter and in the second quarter, keep in mind those are non-cash \u2013 That\u2019s a non-cash entry for us. And the impact is it increases our book value even more. So it\u2019s just an offset we get that gain back when the transaction closes. Sara Gubins : Got it okay, so just to make sure that I understand it, in the first quarter we\u2019ll see some expenses, which are not incorporated into the guidance, but at the same time in the first part of the half of the year we\u2019ll see a benefit from the JV which is also not incorporated into your guidance? Paul Adler : No I would say that in the first quarter we\u2019re going to see more than likely a negative impact, because of the transaction expenses and I\u2019m not ready to comment at all on what we will see in the second quarter, but regardless none of that impact is contemplated in the guidance that we\u2019ve given. Sara Gubins : Okay, and could you tell us what the share count is that you are using for the guidance? Mike Hansen : Sara it is $115 million for fiscal 2016. Sara Gubins : Okay, and could you now just think about what might drive you to the higher end of the revenue range for the guidance at 6.8%? Paul Adler : I think the continued execution by our businesses I think our partners have done a fantastic job in fiscal 2015, and we need to continue to execute well. So our sales performance needs to continue as it has done. We need to continue to be able to penetrate existing customers and we believe that we\u2019ve got a lot of penetration opportunities left. So we need to continue to penetrate our customers and we need to execute. So I think the range of guidance that we\u2019re giving is certainly what we believe to be an achievable range and I think if we execute well like we have this year we can get to towards the top end of that range. Sara Gubins : Okay, and just last question, you mentioned that you were seeing a bit more pricing pressure after having had it improve for the last year. Is it coming in particular regions or from particular types of competitors? I\u2019m wondering what\u2019s driving the change there? Paul Adler : So I\u2019m sorry, maybe I wasn\u2019t clear. We haven\u2019t seen a change in the pricing environment of any significance. Pricing is still competitive. It always has been in our business. It always will be. So pricing is still competitive. But we haven\u2019t seen much of a change in our fourth quarter compared to our third quarter, second quarter, et cetera. What my point was, in the fourth quarter of last year we saw a bit of a change at that point where we saw an improved environment for pricing. And we quite honestly, we talked a little bit about training our people to speak to our customers about the great value that we are providing to our customers. And so a year ago we saw a bit of a change from the third quarter to the fourth quarter in terms of that pricing environment and now we've lapped that change. And so what that does is it has a little bit of an impact on our year-over-year growth as it relates to the third quarter growth compared to the fourth quarter growth. Sara Gubins : Got it, thanks very much that's helpful. Paul Adler : Sure. Operator : We will go next to Nate Brochmann from William Blair. Nate Brochmann : Good evening gentlemen. Mike Hansen : Hi Nate. Nate Brochmann : Just wanted to talk a little bit obviously with the document management business you guys did a great job kind of growing that with a few acquisitions, but then kind of growing organically and then getting the fairly positive shareholder wealth creation event out of that. And I was just wondering when you think about the business now as it stands in terms of the portfolio of services what do you expect to have and be able to grow in terms of replacing that business and what could be the next big opportunity or what else is in the hopper in terms of things to think about? Mike Hansen : Well, the great news is our growth this year has replaced it. Our revenue in fiscal 2015 is almost the same as in fiscal 2014. So the good news is we have replaced it now. Now clearly, how do we continue to grow into the future, from a rental business we need to continue to create solutions for our customers that are of high value. We need to get more known programmers into uniform rental programs, things like new types of Carhartt programs, fire resistant clothing offerings. So we need to continue to create innovation. We need to create innovation with our facilities, services products and services and we need to continue to penetrate. We've got quite a, we believe to be quite a penetration opportunity in our customer base. And the nice thing about having about a million customers is we've got a lot of warms leaves out there that we can continue to work to penetrate. From a first aid, safety and fire business standpoint, it is a bit of the same. We need to go out and capture new customers and we need to continue to look for adjacencies under the umbrellas of safety and protection and we've done a very nice job in creating product adjacencies that we can then sell into existing customers. So it is the answer to your question about how do we continue to grow and what is the business? We feel like we've got a lot of opportunity in our existing businesses. Now having said that, we certainly would look for other ideas that might be wholly new businesses, but it has got to be a business that can create some good long-term value for us. Paul Adler : And you know Mike I think that's actually there is actually one point and like the rental segment is that it is not just the traditional uniform wearer based. As you develop these new fabrics that you are able to attack a whole different suite of end markets, correct? Mike Hansen : Yes that is correct and more retail inspired offerings certainly helps as well. Nate Brochmann : Correct, okay. And that is actually a good read and then I apologize for asking another question on guidance, but I am presuming as you mentioned that there is probably a little bit of pessimism in terms of just looking at the revenue line both on the oil and gas customers as well as just kind of looking at some of the add-stops I know that we have gone from negative to neutral a little positive here and there and now back to negative and we\u2019re not really getting that run rate. So I assume that most in the guidance is probably a little bit of pessimism around the oil and gas and the add-stops with the optimism coming from the new customers and the penetration et cetera in terms of the same playbook, correct? Mike Hansen : Yes that is correct and Nate, I should probably point out one additional item. We\u2019ve seen a fair amount of movement in the Canadian exchange rate during the year. Keep in mind our guidance is total revenue growth for the current year. So for fiscal 2015, our average currency exchange rate was about a $1.15 Canadian and we have seen that now go to closer to 1.20, 1.25. And so our guidance assumes a 1.25 for fiscal 2016 and so that does have about a 50 to 60 basis point negative impact on total revenue growth. So having said that, let me put that aside and make sure that I\u2019m also talking about, look we feel really good about the business. We\u2019ve had some really nice momentum and so we believe that we do have some real nice opportunities. But you\u2019re right, we've got a little bit of headwind in the Canadian currency, got a little bit of headwind in the oil and gas impact and a little bit of headwind in the net add-stops area. Nate Brochmann : Okay. So obviously if any of that kind of changes and we get a different flow, we could get a little upside there. And then just in terms of the bottom line, you've talked about the incremental margins and the gross margin opportunity and maybe even pulling some growth investment maybe into this quarter relative to next year. But is there any additional catch-up and any additional investment at this point that we need on either the hiring front on the sales side or an extra layer of new routes that we are playing catch-up on in terms of thinking about or is it kind of just normal growth investment with that level of revenue in mind? Mike Hansen : Yes, I would say it is normal investment that we have made with the exception that we have talked a little bit about the processing, rental processing capacity. But aside from that, we have been continuously investing in routes in the rental business and the first aid, safety and fire business; we will continue to do that, but generally it is a bit of business as usual. I don\u2019t see any need for an accelerated rate of investment unless something changes like we do see a dramatic change in net add-stops or a dramatic change in the economy. Nate Brochmann : Okay. Great, I appreciate the time. Operator : We will go next to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks, good afternoon. I was just curious on all the discussion on bit of the decline in net add-stops inventory in the quarter and moving into the first quarter, I understand it is incorporated in the guidance [ph] I think, but might be just could you take us a little bit further into what you think is driving that or what you are seeing beyond what you had said already or is it really not much of that? Mike Hansen : Well, I don\u2019t know that there is much to add other than to say we have seen a little bit of a bumpy economic ride. There have been some ups and downs in employment. Some months have been narrower than others. We have seen some macro events that have probably given businesses pause. We have seen a stronger U.S. dollar. We have got the prospect of interest rates. So I think we have seen a little bit of a bumpy ride and I would say aside from that bumpy ride, I don\u2019t have a lot of additional color to add other than the oil and gas impact certainly. Scott Schneeberger : Great, thanks. And then, just I have two others both they are kind of quirky. You guys mentioned legal and professional was elevated in the fourth quarter. I'm curious, was that just associated with what was going on with Shred-it or is there something else particularly on the legal side that we should be concerned or aware about? Mike Hansen : Yes, that was generally a good part of that related to the transaction. Scott Schneeberger : Okay. Thanks and then lastly, just an update on the ERP and its influence on CapEx where we are in that cycle, just want to make sure we are aware of where you are on that on that? Mike Hansen : Yes, we talked about that being about a $100 million project. We have spent about half of that in fiscal 2015. The project is right where we wanted it to be. We are still very optimistic that that will continue on that calendar that we've talk about and so I would expect that we could see another $40 million to $50 million of CapEx during fiscal 2016. We've talked about fiscal 2017 would be the year when we start the rollout and start to see some impact potentially mid-year to the end of the year. Scott Schneeberger : Excellent, thanks very much and nice work. Mike Hansen : Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird. Andrew Wittmann : Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to Mike ask a little bit about the strategic decision on the exit of Shred-it. I mean, first time you contributed in the joint venture, you got the synergies and created the value. You really worked substantially selling the business, but now you are likely to sell it you could have been the buyer and bought it back in. So what were you seeing in the business as it related to the rest of your business that made it the right decision for you to exit that today? Mike Hansen : Well, if we go back a year ago, some of the things that we\u2019ve talked about relating to that business, we really do believe that it was a good business for us. We took a business, changed the business model from onsite to offsite shredding. We added our people, our culture, our processes and we felt like we really made a - created a great business. But there were some things that we didn\u2019t like as much and that is generally what we found was the decision maker was different than the decision maker for most of our businesses. The commodity impact was a bit of a bumpy ride through the years and we weren\u2019t crazy about that. We felt like we were a little concerned that there weren\u2019t many product adjacencies for us in that business. So the growth was coming from volume primarily and so, for those reasons, we and then finally we weren\u2019t seeing enough or improvement quickly enough and that was one of the main reasons why we also wanted to do the transaction with Shred-it a year ago. When we think about how that\u2019s gone over the last year as I\u2019ve mentioned several times in the last few quarters, we've been very, very pleased with how the business has progressed, how the integration has progressed. But when we think about our investment, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in the macro environment. There is a lot of uncertainty about how commodities will continue to affect that business. There is uncertainty in a way of the stock market as it related to the IPO alternative with Greece and China creating some wild rides. There\u2019s uncertainty as it relates to being a minority owner and having a bit of a limited influence. And then finally there was uncertainty as it relates to the impact that it would have on our P&L. And so generally speaking, the thoughts that we had a year ago for making the transaction and the uncertainty about the position that we were in led us to believe that taking the certainty of this deal was a great opportunity for us. Andrew Wittmann : Was there a $50 million that you\u2019re highlighting Mike as you look up to number? Mike Hansen : The total purchase price is $2.3 billion for the entire company, but we have to pull out debt and some transaction expenses and so there can be a little bit of movement in those. And as in most deals there\u2019s a little bit of a hold back and so that\u2019s the reason for the range. Andrew Wittmann : Is it a fair playbook to look at the first time you contributed this to the joint venture where you wound up doing a decent sized special dividend and then kind of followed up some buyback, is that you think decent [indiscernible] are going in assumptions as to how the capital redeployment may go? Mike Hansen : I hate to speculate on that Andy. We haven\u2019t closed the deal yet, so it\u2019s we don\u2019t have the cash. Our Board so we just announced it yesterday, so our Board will certainly have that on their agenda and give a thoughtful process to how we put that cash to work. So I can\u2019t speculate on that yet. But as you know we\u2019ve shown a very much of willingness to put that cash to work. Andrew Wittmann : And then my final question from me one more is, just your comments on the sales productivity, it sounds like it must have been really strong in the fourth quarter. Can you give us a sense about how the sales productivity this fourth quarter compared to the sales productivity last fourth quarter? Mike Hansen : We do see some very good productivity from our sales reps, it was probably relative to the prior year our best quarter of the year. I\u2019d rather not get into too much detail, but it was a good quarter for us. Our people and our partners have been very productive. Our training processes have gone very, very well. We have very good products and services to arm them with and they\u2019ve done a very nice job. Andrew Wittmann : Okay well, that seems like it would have an implication then for the revenue growth rate since that wasn't all captured as new business in the fourth quarter, that should give you at least some visibility into the revenue growth that you have next year. Is that fair? Mike Hansen : It is fair. It does give us a bit of a nice start to the year. Andrew Wittmann : Okay, thank you very much. Mike Hansen : Sure. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Manav Patnaik : Hi good evening guys and firstly congratulations on the way you guys did your portfolio realignment I guess. The one question I had I mean is just around the M&A your appetite, you said you\u2019d love to do tuck-ins and maybe even the larger one occasionally. But if I look at the history, I mean, in uniform, you guys haven't done a deal in the last two years, really. In first aid, also it's been like two or three a year, I guess going back the last three years if I look at the disclosures. So maybe if you can just help us understand the pipeline that you see, like are there opportunities? I know you'd love to do it, but does it seem like there's a lot out there? Mike Hansen : There are opportunities, now I would say that in our rental business and probably our first aid business there are as many opportunities as there was 15 years ago and probably not, but there are opportunities, they are very good opportunities and we\u2019ll continue to explore them. But they have to be at the right value for us. We generally need a willing seller and so far we just haven\u2019t seen the alignment, but we\u2019re certainly active and we\u2019ll not hesitate to make an acquisition particularly in our existing businesses that we believe has good value. Manav Patnaik : Okay and is the, I guess the preference for the larger deal, like what is the, I mean is there an active consideration to look at the larger ones versus the smaller ones or not really? Mike Hansen : I would just say that we certainly would be involved if there was a willing seller or a process and we think a large acquisition could at the right value be accretive for us. And so we would certainly take a look. Manav Patnaik : Okay and then just last one from me, I know you talked briefly about some of the trends and for the net add-stops, but generally speaking, is there any way for you to characterize based on what you guys have seen historically, where we are in terms of on innings or however you want to characterize it in terms of the upsets and just employment -- I mean improvement on the employment front? Mike Hansen : I am not sure that I can give you a specific in terms of innings or where I think we are. We've had a fairly nice stretch of economic performance albeit bumpy, but we've had a fairly nice stretch of economic performance over the last several years. How long will that continue, I am not sure. What I do know is that we will do our best through any economic cycle to continue to penetrate existing customers and then find ways to create value to know programmers. But I am not sure I can give you a specific inning or timeframe Manav. Manav Patnaik : Okay, all right fair enough thank you guys. Operator : We'll go next to Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi thank you for squeezing me in here. Most of my questions have been answered. I just want to touch on two items that were brought up a little bit earlier. Just on the add-stops metric what has the trajectory been? No I'm not talking about the last quarter, but just the last few years and has there really been more of an upswing if you would kind of chart that and where do we stand versus let's say where we were seven or eight years ago before we had kind of the great depression or the great recession, where do we stand versus that because there was always just kind of a lever are we back to levels that we had seen prior to things going bad or where do you see it right now? Mike Hansen : I would say that the performance has certainly been more choppy in the last several years. Going back prerecession, I don\u2019t have that at my fingertips but I will tell you over the last few years, because of the choppiness that we've seen in the adds and stops, we've talked a lot about seeming to have a positive trend only the churn next quarter and to a bit of a negative trend because of the choppiness that we have seen. The overall impact to the business I would say has been a bit muted and there still is opportunity to see a better impact. I was just looking at -- if you think about the jobs that are in the historically strong uniform rental sectors. Some are still at lower levels than prerecession. And I think that is just a reflection of the bumpiness and inconsistency that we've seen in the last several years. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And then one other thing that was brought up before and I just want to touch on, do you have any recent new introduction of products or services that have been added like what you did with Carhartt and what you've done with [indiscernible] kind of agreement and what you've done with kind of the floor washing, is there anything recent that's been added that seems like it is another potential opened end market for you guys? Mike Hansen : Well we're always working on innovation Shlomo, but I will tell you that our chemical business, our Carhartt business, they are still relatively small and we've got a lot of growth opportunities still in those. And we have the other one that I could mention is a our signature series hygiene products and even though we've introduced those a few years ago, it takes a little bit of time to get those penetrated throughout the country and so we're still working on those. We're focused on continuing to drive penetration. I don't have any new things to talk about. We certainly know that innovation is important and we're working on it. But I don\u2019t have anything new to talk to you about. We're just focused on continuing to penetrate with some of these newer products and services where we've got a lot of room. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay great, thank you so much. Mike Hansen : Sure. Operator : And at this time, we have no further questions in the queue. Mike Hansen : Well, thank you very much for joining us tonight. We will be issuing our first quarter earnings in late September and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Baird Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer Denny Galindo - Morgan Stanley Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets John Healy - Northcoast Research Jason Rodgers - Great Lakes Review Operator : Good day everyone and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Hansen : Good evening and thank you for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2016. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. As we reported today, in the press release, please note that a change in our reportable segments U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles require companies to evaluate their reportable operating segments when certain events occur. As a result of a recent evaluation, effective June 1, 2015, we will report the following operating segments : Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services, and All Other. All Other primarily consists of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business division. We are pleased to report first quarter revenue of $1.199 billion, an increase of 8.8% from the prior year first quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, work day differences, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 6.8%. Organic revenue growth for our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 6.8% and the First Aid and Safety Services segments organic growth was 10.5%. The performance of our sales force in both segments was strong. We continue to add new customers and provide existing customers with additional products and services from our broad line. First quarter operating income was $185.5 million, which was 15.5% of revenue compared to an operating margin of 14.8% in the prior year period. This represents a 70 basis point improvement from last year\u2019s operating margin. Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 was $106.2 million and earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter were $0.93. Note that the first quarter of last fiscal year\u2019s net income and EPS from continuing operations were positively impacted by a gain from the sale of stock in an equity method investment. Excluding this gain, first quarter net income and EPS from continuing operations increased 15.1% and 19.2% respectively, compared to the prior year. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue improved 50 basis points to 8.9% from 8.4% of revenue in last fiscal year\u2019s first quarter, excluding the prior year period gain. We also demonstrated our continuing commitment to providing shareholder value through our stock buyback program. During August and into September through the close of business yesterday, Cintas purchased 2.9 million shares of common stock. This share buyback had no impact on first quarter EPS, but is expected to benefit full fiscal year EPS by $0.05. Since the beginning of fiscal 2016, approximately 4.5 million shares of common stock have been purchased at an aggregate cost of $381.2 million. As of September 23, 2015 Cintas had 381.8 million, available under the current Board of Directors stock repurchase authorization. As Cintas\u2019 CEO, Scott Farmer stated in the today\u2019s press release, we are off to a good start to our fiscal 2016 year. We thank our employees whom we call partners for their strong performance. On August 1, 2015 the company closed on the acquisition of Zee Medical, for a consideration of approximately $134 million in cash. About $121 million were paid at the closing of the transaction and an additional $13 million may be paid in the future fiscal years subject to holdback provisions. We are in the very early stages of the integration of the Zee business. We are excited about the benefits and opportunities this acquisition provides, including expanding our footprint and enabling us to serve an even greater number of customers in North America. As a result of our first quarter results and the recent acquisition of Zee Medical, we\u2019re updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal 2016 revenue to be in the range of $4.8 billion to $4.880 billion, and fiscal 2016 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.88. This guidance does not include any EPS impact from the announced agreement to sell our investment in Shred-it, which has not yet closed. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy or additional share buybacks. The EPS guidance is detailed in a table within today's press release. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Paul for more details on company financial performance. Paul Adler : Thanks, Mike. First please note that there were 66 workdays in this year's first quarter compared to 65 in last year's first quarter. The second and third quarters of this fiscal year will have the same number of work days as last year of 65. This year's fourth quarter will have 66 workdays, compared to 65 in last year's fourth quarter. Thus fiscal year 2016 will have 262 work days, two more than in fiscal 2015. As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.8% in the first quarter. New business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services, retention, and price increases all contributed to the strong growth rate. Total company gross margin was 43.7% for the first quarter of this year, compared to 43.4% last year. Total company energy related expenses for this years\u2019 first quarter were 2.2%. Last year's first quarter energy-related expenses were 2.8%. As Mike previously stated, effective June 1, 2015, we have three reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services, and All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection services and our Direct Sale business division. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segments includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogues to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $938 million, an increase of 7.4% compared to last year's first quarter. Organic growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, workday differences, and foreign currency exchange rate changes, was 6.8%. For comparative purposes, this segment's organic growth for the previous quarter, our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter was 6.2%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.7% for the first quarter, an increase of 90 basis points from 43.8% in last year's first quarter. Energy-related costs were 70 basis points lower than last year's first quarter. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segments includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $99 million, which was 24.5% higher than last year's first quarter. Total growth benefited from the Zee Medical acquisition. On an organic basis growth was 10.5%. This was a good sequential increase in the growth rate from 8.2% in our fourth quarter. This segment's gross margin was 42.3% in the first quarter, compared to 45.9% in the prior year period. Energy-related costs were 40 basis points lower than in last year's first quarter. As Mike stated earlier, we are in the very beginning stages of the integration of the Zee business. As expected, our First Aid and Safety Services results were negatively impacted by conversion costs, the amortization of intangible assets resulting from the purchase price accounting, and other charges. This impact will continue in the short term as we assimilate the acquired business and begin to realize the synergies.  We\u2019re excited about the benefits and opportunities that this acquisition provides. Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 28.2% as a percentage of first quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A and last year's first quarter of 28.5%. The 30 basis point improvement in SG&A was realized despite a 40 basis point increase in medical expenses this quarter, compared to last year. On July 15, 2015 Cintas announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to sell its investments in Shred-it for approximately $550 million to $600 million before taxes. The transaction is still expected to close in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2015. As a result of the announced sale of the investments, the related income or loss is now reported in discontinued operations. The investment in Shred-it on the balance sheet is recorded at assets held for sale and a related tax liability is recorded as liabilities held for sale. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 37.2%, the same rate as in the prior year period. We expect a full year 2016 effective tax rate to be 37.3%. Our cash and marketable securities were $200 million at August 31, a decrease of $233 million from the $433 million in May 31. Cash provided by operating activities was $143 million in our first quarter. Uses of cash included $121 million, net of cash acquired for acquisitions in about $222 million or repurchases of Cintas common stock. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were approximately $63 million. Our CapEx by reportable operating segments was as follows : $55 million in uniform rental, $4 million in first aid and safety, and $4 million in all other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Greg Bardi : Hi, this is actually Greg calling on for Manav, just wanted to ask about the guidance. It looks like excluding Zee Medical and the buybacks, the guidance is essentially unchanged even with the pretty solid numbers. Just wondering if there has been a changed to your view versus when you first gave guidance or if there is \u2013 if it\u2019s just kind of conservatism so early in the year? Mike Hansen : You are correct. Without Zee and without the share buyback impact, the guidance is generally the same. Our first quarter results were generally in line and we still feel good about the year. There is no change in the way we feel about that with maybe the only possible exception of the Canadian dollar continues to weaken. Today, it was somewhere in the 1.33, 1.34 range which is a little bit weaker than we guided at 1.25. So we may see a little bit of top line impact as we go through the rest of the year. But aside from that, we still feel good about the year and not really any change to our thinking. Greg Bardi : Fair enough. And then on the M&A environment, should we think of Zee Medical as kind of a one-off opportunity that you\u2019ve had or are you seeing comparatively larger companies coming available recently? Mike Hansen : Certainly Zee is a great opportunity for us and one that we feel very excited about. It certainly does demonstrate that we want to put our cash to work and we really do like the opportunities for M&A particularly in a case like Zee where there is a lot of tuck-in opportunity. I would say I can\u2019t comment on any other items because I wouldn\u2019t want to speculate, but we\u2019re certainly continuing to be active and looking for opportunities to add value through M&A. Greg Bardi : Okay. Thanks, Mike. Mike Hansen : Okay. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan. Andrew Steinerman : Hi, could you review which driver of revenue growth caused the acceleration in the quarter to 6.8% growth year-over-year, you outlined 60 basis points of acceleration which segment did that come from and what\u2019s the organic revenue growth implied for the full year in the revenue guidance? Mike Hansen : Well, we \u2013 a number of things. As Paul mentioned, we had a very good new business quarter. One of the things in the last call that we talked about was a little bit of preparing in the fourth quarter to get off to a good start. So we probably hired some reps early, we added some routes earlier and we got some good momentum going into the year and that continued through the quarter, new business was very strong. Customer retention was a little bit better than last year so another benefit not as significant as the new business. Pricing was I would say the environment didn\u2019t change much but it was still a fairly positive environment with the exception of our energy related customers. Andrew Steinerman : Sure. Mike Hansen : So those three areas all contributed. I would say that there was a little bit of an offset from those energy related customers as we\u2019ve talked in the last several quarters. Our oil and gas customers are certainly operating under difficult environments as well as our mining customers and we saw our uniform rental net add-stops being negative for the quarter. So there was a bit of a drag from that, but certainly\u2026 Andrew Steinerman : Did you say add-stops were negative overall because of oil and gas or add-stops were negative in oil and gas? Mike Hansen : Because of oil, gas and mining. Andrew Steinerman : Okay, perfect. And then the other part of the question was, what was the organic growth? What is the organic growth implied in the revenue guidance for the year? Mike Hansen : We haven\u2019t provided that and I would rather not get into that number. I don\u2019t have it calculated. We are really focused on the top line but I would say that we don\u2019t expect many significant changes to that \u2013 to the first quarter performance. We still feel good about the year. Andrew Steinerman : Right. So in the same vicinity that we\u2019ve been thinking about it for a while now? Mike Hansen : Yes. Andrew Steinerman : Okay, good. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to George Tong with Piper Jaffray. George Tong : Hi, good afternoon. Can you talk a bit about how much of your growth is being fueled by organic customer growth versus penetration of the non-programmer market and how that\u2019s evolved in recent quarters? Mike Hansen : I can\u2019t give you any specific numbers, George, but I will tell you that the penetration opportunities still exist and they are \u2013 we are taking advantage of them. Our ability to sell particularly into good uniform rental, anchor accounts with our signature series hygiene products, our chemicals, our microfiber mops et cetera it\u2019s still going very well. I would say that new business has been a strength over the last five years or so but penetration has continued to be very, very solid for us. And while I can\u2019t give you a number, both are continuing to drive organic growth. George Tong : Got it. And then going back to add-stops, can you describe how add-stops have evolved over the course of the quarter and how add-stops are evolving now into this current quarter so far? Mike Hansen : I would say that for the quarter, we experienced a little bit of continued deterioration from our oil, gas and mining. Aside from that, I would say it was a pretty constant and consistent quarter. So, not a lot of changes, we went through the quarter and not much change since August 31. We are only a couple of weeks in, but nothing marketable to speak up. George Tong : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Joe Box : Hi, Mike. Hey, Paul. Mike Hansen : Hi, Joe. Joe Box : So it\u2019s been a few years now since I think your last big addition with respect to route capacity. How are you guys thinking about route capacity going forward? Is it going to be added on really an as needed basis or do you think potentially we could be seeing maybe a broad based addition like we had a few years ago? Mike Hansen : Generally, Joe, we want to continue to add routes throughout each year and we have continued to do that. So I wouldn\u2019t expect that we will have a big influx of routes anytime soon but a little bit depends on the nature of the economy and what we are seeing with our customers. But I would say I wouldn\u2019t expect to have an influx of new routes in the Rental business. In the First Aid business, we have continued to add routes. We have in that business, our SSRs really do drive a lot of growth and we want to make sure that they have the capacity, the time to spend selling and so we are fairly aggressive in adding routes to that business. But I will tell you with the Zee acquisition, there is a lot of integration to be doing and we\u2019re going to have to take that quarter-by-quarter. Joe Box : Appreciate that. Thank you. And then maybe just as a follow-up on the macro point that you made earlier, I mean I think we all have a pretty good sense of what\u2019s going on in oil and gas and mining, but I am curious if you may be seeing a bifurcation between industrial oriented customers outside of oil and gas and mining versus maybe what you\u2019re seeing from consumer driven businesses, and if you\u2019re seeing any sort of a change how might that impact you? Mike Hansen : I wouldn\u2019t say that we are seeing a marketable change from the other customers but the environment has been pretty good. I mean they are \u2013 when we can show them value, they will take additional products and services that do add that value. But I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019ve seen a marketable change to that, but certainly a different operating environment than our oil, gas and mining customers. Joe Box : And then one last one from me. Paul, what was the margin tailwind in the Uniform Rental business just from the extra day? Paul Adler : Joe, typically that extra day in the quarter gives us about 40 basis points to 50 basis points improvement. Joe Box : Okay. So if I would strip out the 40 basis points to 50 basis points and I think you said there was 90 basis points of tailwind from Energy within the Uniform Rental business, net-net we are looking at a gross margin that\u2019s down in the Uniform Rental business. Can you maybe put some color around why it would have been ex those items? Mike Hansen : So, yes, we had a 70 basis in the Rental business, we had a 70 basis point tailwind from Energy but roughly 40. When we say 40 basis points to 50 basis points of work day, probably 40 of that is in gross margin, 10 of that is in SG&A. So let\u2019s call it about a 40 basis point benefit from the work day. We have talked about the Energy related customers creating a bit of a drag. Keep in mind when those customers stop or eliminate positions, that is lost revenue but we still have the amortization of the garments and we still are driving the truck to that customer. So we still have a lot of the cost without the revenue. That is basically an offset to that work day benefit during our first quarter. Now I will tell you also, when you compare our first quarter gross margin in the rental business to the fourth quarter in a quarter that had the same level of energy, our gross margin was 190 basis points better. And let\u2019s take off 40 basis points from the work day, we still had a very nice sequential improvement and we feel very, very good about that. We are getting a lot of good leverage.  And then the last comment I\u2019ll make is, one thing to keep in mind about last year was that our first quarter gross margin in Rental was the strongest of the year. It was 50 basis points better than any other quarter. We did have a very good quarter. There was a one-time customer buyout within the quarter that helped that gross margin. And so I think we had a very good gross margin quarter and I would expect that we\u2019re going to continue to see good leveraging within that business knowing that we do have a little bit \u2013 we are expecting a little bit of the tailwind or all of the tailwind of the Energy costs to go away in the latter part of the year. Does that help with our gross margin? Joe Box : Yes. That\u2019s a perfect clarification. Thanks for that. Have a good night guys. Mike Hansen : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird. Andy Wittmann : Hey, Mike. What was the size of that buyout last year that you just mentioned? Can you quantify in terms of margin or dollars? Mike Hansen : Yes. We had commented that it was about 50 basis points worth of growth which would effectively mean the same kind of thing on margin. Andy Wittmann : Yes. It\u2019s basically, almost a 100% flow through when you have to do that. Mike Hansen : Yes. Andy Wittmann : Okay. So just on Zee Medical, I thought maybe you guys might call out the integration cost, closing cost separately but it looks like you\u2019re expensing that and just running that through the P&L and as a result you\u2019re not showing EPS accretion but can you give us an idea of if you take out some of those one timers of the integration cost, can you give us what those would have been for the quarter as well as your outlook for the year so we can get a sense of what the normalized or the introductory accretion is from Zee? Mike Hansen : As you can probably tell from our guidance, we expect no impact on EPS this fiscal year. So this acquisition is about a third the size of our existing First Aid business. It\u2019s a large acquisition for us and there are a lot of integration steps to be done. We need to rebrand the trucks, we are putting people into Cintas uniforms, we have to convert the systems and we\u2019re going to be doing that over the course of the year. I would say the other thing about the Zee business, the routes were not as efficient as the Cintas routes. The custom, the revenue per route, the revenue per customer is not nearly as high as Cintas and so it\u2019s a bit of a - a little bit more of an inefficient business and we've got some work to do to integrate and get that to the levels where we want them to be. Having said that the integration is going very well and we\u2019re excited about that business and its opportunity that it creates for our First Aid business. I\u2019m hesitant to get into any more specific integration costs in the first quarter. We really just got it in the month of May, I'm sorry in the month of August and had a lot of meetings training et cetera and we\u2019re really just now getting started on that. And so again, I\u2019ll reiterate, the current year we're not expecting any accretion, but we certainly do expect to get that next fiscal year. Once we see how the integration develops as the year goes on, we\u2019ll be more in a position to provide guidance at that point. Andy Wittmann : Okay that's fair. We will look forward to maybe an update on that in the next quarter, maybe just can you give view or broad stroke view of what you think the cost synergies of the businesses are recognizing that there is route overlap and maybe some route underutilization that you inherited? Mike Hansen : I\u2019m not prepared to do that yet. I want to see more develop within the integration. We certainly have an integration plan, but I'd rather wait until we see a little bit more of the integration develop. Andy Wittmann : Okay, that is fine. And then, I guess, are you seeing anything different on the competitive environment in terms of pricing you mentioned that it was additive to your quarter, it just seem like the last 12, 18 months was, I\u2019d say pretty good for the overall industry, I think you guys benefit and others did too, do you have tough comps or are your competitors getting more competitive with, for new business pricing. Is there any risk that we have to see in the future from the competitive environment? Mike Hansen : Well of course there is. The pricing is always competitive, there is no question about that and we are only able to raise prices when we are showing great value to our customers and that\u2019s the, as long as we can continue to show that we are providing great value we don't necessarily see a change in the environment unless the economy changes. I would say that based on that pricing environment, being relatively similar to last, the last several quarters, we haven't seen a lot of competitive changes in this first quarter. And I can't say that that won't happen in the future, but we haven't seen it yet. Andy Wittmann : Got it. Okay, maybe just a final question just on the reclassification of the segments, I\u2019m curious as to why the fire protection got carved out and put into the other segment whereas the other stuff now redefined, the First Aid and Safety Business and maybe now that we have these new segments how we should be thinking about the margins as we model forward on those? Paul Adler : Andy, this is Paul. You probably know the accounting guidance is pretty descriptive about reportable operating segments and the guidance requires that companies evaluate their segments periodically and definitely when changes occur. And we had such a change in the first quarter with the acquisition of Zee, and therefore as a result of evaluating, reevaluating that as our reportable operating segments, looking at the guidance we needed to make some changes and the most material of those changes obviously are the fact that First Aid and Safety is now a standalone segment separate from fire. And then we also made a change in terms of including the sale of items from our catalogues to customers on our routes and including that in the Uniform, Rental and Facility services segment. So those are the two major changes and in the guidance it permits and it is acceptable than to - once you reach a certain threshold of segments and disclosures that the other business units than are combined into an all other segment and that\u2019s where fire is and that's where the direct sale business, you\u2019re thinking about direct sale to national accounts that type of business. That's where those reside. Mike Hansen : Andy that fire business, the direct sale business there still very important to us. We believe that they are good businesses, but we are giving visibility to 90% of our revenue going forward and certainly the focus is on those two largest businesses that we have. As it relates to the margins of that All Other, you know we expect improvement just like we do in our Other Businesses and there are certainly as leveraged to be gained, there are route density opportunities and so we certainly do expect continued improvement because we have the Direct Sale business in there, it could be a little bit bumpy at times because of the ups and downs of that business, but generally speaking we expect improvement. Andy Wittmann : That makes sense. Given that Direct Sale now got split between two segments there\u2019s a lot of moving parts, is it, are you guys thinking about giving us maybe last year's numbers restated for the - on a quarterly basis for the new classification of the segments by any chance? Should we be looking for that? Mike Hansen : Yes. Actually in the earnings release income statements there is a table supplemental information and there we have recast it all the prior year quarter's by segments, we don't bring new gross margin income, assets, so you will have some good segment data under the new structure for fiscal 2015 and then obviously 2016 going forward. Andy Wittmann : Perfect. Yes, I see that. Thank you very much. Operator : We will go next to Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sara Gubins : Hi thanks good afternoon. Could you talk about your manufacturing clients and are you seeing any change in the behavior? Mike Hansen : We have not seen much of a change in their behavior in this quarter compared to the last quarter. I would say that\u2019s true for not only manufacturing, but our other verticals, excluding that energy-related sector. Sara Gubins : Okay. And then share repurchases really accelerated in the last three quarters, could you talk about how we might think about share purchase potential on a run rate basis over time? Mike Hansen : As we've talked about in previous calls, our goal is certainly to grow organically and followed by M&A and we would love other opportunities like Zee Medical, but when we have additional cash what we certainly will take a look at in increasing dividend, but then if there is cash remaining outside of those opportunities our board likes to put it to work and so I say that Sarah because a lot of it depends on how that cash balance looks and what the other opportunities for cash are. I would say that that buyback program has been quite a benefit, we believe to our shareholders and if we have available cash we\u2019ve shown that we will put it to work. While I can't give you any specifics because it\u2019s a board level decision I would just say that if we have available cash we like to put it to work. We have $381 million left on our current authorization and the board will be looking at our positions over the rest of the fiscal year. Sara Gubins : Okay, thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. Guys could you comment on specifically oil and gas customers and mining separately with regard to what innings you think you are in on add stocks on both as is the headwind that has been certainly on oil and gas, do you think if you could speak to both on where you think you are on the cycle, thanks. Mike Hansen : That\u2019s a tough question, Scott. I would say that it felt like from an oil rig standpoint in the first quarter, there was some stability towards the end of the quarter. But then you read an article like in today\u2019s Wall Street where there are fracking firms that are starting to close up shop. That\u2019s a tough one to call. I would love to say that we are in the late innings of that oil and gas, but I don\u2019t know that I can say that. I would say that today \u2013 as of August 31, those oil and gas customers for us, the revenue is lower today than it was at May 31 because of continued net stops but I\u2019m not exactly sure, Scott, where that\u2019s going to end up. From a mining perspective, we see some pretty hard hits and I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t give you much future guidance in that either other than to say that it\u2019s been a tough environment for the mining industries at least for our customers and I would expect that that\u2019s not going to turnaround overnight nor will the oil and gas customer impact turnaround overnight. Scott Schneeberger : All right, thanks for that. And then you\u2019ve addressed some pricing questions earlier, but with regard to pricing across all of your segments, all of your markets and I imagine it\u2019s kind of soft in those two areas we\u2019re just talking about, but it sounds like it\u2019s pretty firm elsewhere. Is there anywhere else outside of rental that good or bad that bares attention or is everything fairly status quo? Mike Hansen : I would say that everything is status quo. Now keep in mind that Energy customer impact also does affect First Aid and Safety. We have a lot of good Energy customers but having said that, I would say that the pricing environment for most others is status quo. Scott Schneeberger : Okay, great. Thanks, Mike. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Denny Galindo with Morgan Stanley. Denny Galindo : Good afternoon. Just quickly on Zee Medical, how much decline in margins in that First Aid and Safety segment was strictly due to Zee Medical? Can we expect a similar amount of impact for the rest of the year? Mike Hansen : I think that we would have had somewhat of an increase without Zee Medical in that gross margin. I would say that if the integration continues to go well and we start the process of rebranding and putting the routes on to our systems as the year goes on, we would expect to see some improvement. So I would expect that the drag that we saw in the first quarter is going to be the worst of the year and we should start to see a little bit of improvement. I would say that for the year we don\u2019t expected necessarily to turn positive for the cumulative year but by the fourth quarter we could see a little bit of benefit if the integration goes well. Denny Galindo : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And another quick one there, is there any seasonality at all to Zee Medical or is there any \u2013 you added one month this quarter, is that a representative month or is it higher or lower than what the run rate will be? Mike Hansen : I would say that from a seasonal standpoint, it\u2019s probably very similar to our business where we have a lot of outdoor activity in the First Aid business in the summer, a lot of construction sites et cetera. You get into the winter, you see better margins because of the cold and flu season. So I think it would track the same kind of performance of our First Aid business. Now, because of the disruption that is happening because of the integration, I am not ready to say that, that the month of August was representative of the year. I would certainly love to see us improve on that but we\u2019re going to need to let the dust clear a little bit on the integration before we can give you a good run rate number. Denny Galindo : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then taking a step back, you talked a little early about route extension, are there any particular cities or metro areas that you\u2019re thinking could be a good opportunity? We had looked at your locations and it seems like the big cities like New York, LA, Chicago had a very low amount of your facilities compared to the total market but any color there would be helpful. Mike Hansen : We think all of those areas are very good opportunities for more route density, no doubt about it. We do some comparisons internally and from one location to another and we\u2019ve got locations that are more mature where the route density is quite a bit higher than in some of the larger cities like New York and LA even Philadelphia. So we think there really are some good opportunities in a lot of big cities not just a few but a lot. We are not nearly penetrated to the extent we think we can be. Denny Galindo : Okay. And another clean up one, any update on the SAP implementation? How is that going? Are you still thinking the timeline will be similar to what you thought in the past? Mike Hansen : That project is going very well. We are on the same schedule as we talked about over the last few quarters. We are on the same cost expectation as we\u2019ve been over the last few quarters and so that means we would expect that we will come out of the realization mode at the end or towards the end of this fiscal year and start to put that system to work a little bit in fiscal 2017 from the standpoint of the roll out should start to happen. And so we will see a little bit of the \u2013 I shouldn\u2019t say a little bit, we will see some cost impact and we will quantify that more once we get to the point where we know we\u2019re rolling out but we will see some cost impact next fiscal year. Denny Galindo : Okay. And then lastly sort of a bigger picture question, one thing we\u2019ve been hearing about a little bit is automation and it kind of feels like other analyst here talks about automation in terms of self driving cars and now you see here a lot in the restaurant industry servers or various positions there. Is that something that you\u2019re seeing it all in terms of your add-stops right now, any impact or is there something that could emerge as the headwind in the future if some of these uniform wears are taken out of the stocks to automation? Mike Hansen : I can\u2019t tell you that we could \u2013 we\u2019ve seen a noticeable impact of that. I am sure it\u2019s happening here and there, but we haven\u2019t seen a noticeable impact. I would like to believe that we in North America are very entrepreneurial and we\u2019re going to continue to create jobs and replace certain jobs that get automated, and we\u2019re going to do our best to put those new jobs into uniform. We certainly believe that we want to continue to put more and different types of job functions into uniforms and we\u2019re going to continue to work on that. I think we\u2019ve been pretty successful over the last handful of years and that we\u2019re going to continue to look for those opportunities and I like to bet on the North American entrepreneur to create more jobs and we\u2019re going to put them in uniform. Denny Galindo : Sounds good. That\u2019s it from me. Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Gary Bisbee : Hi guys. Good afternoon. I wonder if you could share with us to help us think about the trending, what the organic revenue growth was from the new segments over the four quarters of last year. Mike Hansen : I believe that I can give you a little bit of that, yes. So let me talk Uniform Rental and Facility Services, in the first quarter last year it was 8.5%, in the second quarter it was 8.1%, in the third quarter it was 7.9%, and as Paul mentioned in the fourth quarter it was 6.2%. So not a whole lot difference from what we reported especially directionally. From a First Aid and Safety standpoint, 10% even in the first quarter, 13.7% in the second quarter, 10.6% in the third quarter, 8.2% in the fourth quarter. From an all other standpoint, it was 0.8% in the first quarter, it was negative 0.5% in the second quarter, 3.6% in the third quarter, 3.8% in the fourth quarter and you can kind of see there a little bit of the bumpiness that we talked about in that direct sale business. Gary Bisbee : And then I don\u2019t think you gave us any color on the other in the segment commentary. What was the organic growth this quarter? Mike Hansen : Oh, I\u2019m sorry. Paul Adler : It was 4.9. Gary Bisbee : Okay. Thank you. And then is there any more clarity you can provide or directional commentary on what the after tax proceeds from the shredded sale is going to be or how we should think about taxes? Mike Hansen : I would say that, so you can think about the \u2013 lets go to the midpoint of the range that Paul gave of 575 in proceed. Now one thing to keep in mind is some of those proceeds will drag out a little bit with kind of the customary holdbacks but let\u2019s go to the midpoint of that number. You will see on the balance sheet that there is an asset held-for-sale of 194, 275 that is our book value. The difference between the proceeds and that book value is a gain on which we\u2019ll have tax of 37.3%. In addition to that on the balance sheet, there is a liability held for sale of 78,457 and that essentially is a differed tax item because we did not pay any tax on last year\u2019s gain at the time of that transaction nor did we paid tax on the dividend that occurred in May. And so when we pay taxes, we will have a little bit of a catch up because of that differed liability. I would expect that, as Paul said, we will see we expect that to close in the fourth quarter of this calendar year. I would expect that if that happens, we will pay those taxes in the first calendar quarter of next year. Gary Bisbee : Great. Okay. And those taxes I guess will they flow through discontinued operations because that\u2019s where the gain is? Mike Hansen : Yes, it\u2019s built into our tax rate and so you will see essentially a net income that is the after tax gain. Gary Bisbee : Gotcha. Okay. All right, great. That\u2019s helpful. Probably not but any thoughts on plans for the proceeds? I know last time you got the first \u2013 there was a special dividend provided, any thought on doing that again? Mike Hansen : We want to see that close first. Our Board will certainly have that on their agenda and we\u2019ll be talking about it but we need to see that close before we commit to spending it. Gary Bisbee : Okay. And then one clean up one, what was the buyback number of shares in the quarter versus early in the second quarter. I think you lump them together. Is that fair? Mike Hansen : I don\u2019t \u2013 Gary, I don\u2019t have that in my fingertips in terms of the \u2013 we did buy some shares in September, I don\u2019t have that at my fingertips in terms of the first quarter only. Gary Bisbee : That\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry about it. And then just one bigger picture question, I think you\u2019ve been asked this in a different way earlier but fiscal 2015 was the second year in a row where you pushed out client capacity additions that you talked about at the beginning of the year and I guess I just wanted to understand and once or twice you commented that permitting and things like that was part of the issue but how is utilization across the entire network and do you have markets today that aren\u2019t growing because you\u2019re so short on capacity or was that really \u2013 those additions you\u2019ve talked about and delayed, is that more giving you the capacity to grow for several more years? Thanks. Mike Hansen : Yes, there certainly are those logistical issues of finding the right land, getting the permitting done and then actually building the building. We certainly do have some markets that have capacity that\u2019s getting tight. It\u2019s not preventing us from growing but we are getting close in some of those markets and we do need to add some capacity and our expectation is that we will do that towards the backend of this year, but it\u2019s not preventing us from growing. Gary Bisbee : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Mike Hansen : Okay. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to John Healy with Northcoast Research. John Healy : Thanks. Mike I wanted to see if you could give us a little bit more color about performance of the Texas and the Canadian regions. You have been upfront about the oil and gas and the mining exposure, but if you just look at those geographies beyond just the vertical they serve, if you just think about the state of the country, how do the growth rates to those two markets look compared to what you guys are reporting for the rest of your business? Mike Hansen : John, I honesty I don\u2019t have that at my finger tips and I don\u2019t think I would like to give that level of detail out just for competitive reasons, but certainly in Texas and Canada, in West Virginia there are a lot of oil, gas and mining customers and those are the hardest hit areas. We are not shrinking in any of those areas, we\u2019re still growing and certainly not at the same pace as the rest of the country, but I don\u2019t have a number to share with you. John Healy : I can understand that, but, I guess what I was hoping to get out was just kind of the spillover effect from the oil and gas, specific sectors into other areas of your business within those states, I\u2019m curious to get your thoughts on how much contagion did you see in those markets, was it worse than you thought, it is still to be felt, I\u2019m just trying to understand the spillover factor? Mike Hansen : We talked a lot last year about that oil and gas being 2% to 3% of our total revenue that sector has gotten hit pretty hard. I would say that while that the - that sector has been hit hard and maybe a little harder than we would have expected, we haven\u2019t seen the spillover to be that much more significant and really not any more significant than we would have expected throughout the course of the last year. I think it has been fairly connected to that energy sector, but we\u2019ve been able to grow quite well despite that and so we don\u2019t see a lot of spillover. John Healy : Okay. And then I wanted to ask on the M&A front, clearly after organic growth that\u2019s the your biggest priority. I think we are all pretty familiar with what is available to you in terms of asset potential on the Uniform side, but could you talk a little bit more about the First Aid and Safety, I wasn\u2019t that familiar with Zee Medical before the acquisition and are there a lot of kind of what I would say these mid size operators out there that would make sense, or what\u2019s the environment like for those types of assets, you know what\u2019s the landscape like there? Mike Hansen : There are some small independent opportunities that could be out there. Zee did have a franchise network and so there are some opportunities there, at the right value. I would say there are not a lot of other large players when we think about that business the competition is coming from those smaller players, but also the do it yourselfers, the Grainger\u2019s, the people going down the Wal-Mart or Sam\u2019s club, so I would say that the M&A as the business exists today is likely going to be smaller tuck-in opportunities. John Healy : Okay. And then just lastly, I might have missed it so I apologize, but the Shred-it move, when do you expect that to close, maybe you guys spend a month out there? Mike Hansen : We\u2019ve said in the fourth quarter of the calendar year. John Healy : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Jason Rodgers : Yes. I wondered if you could give the annual sales figure for Zee Medical, as well as sales by geography and perhaps how their margins compare to your First Aid and Safety business, thanks. Mike Hansen : Well the annual revenues as we mentioned in our press release are about, we would expect $100 million to $120 million, because we will own Zee for 10 months this year, we are expecting $90 million to $100 million. I don\u2019t have at my fingertips the revenue by geography, but I will tell you that our margins are in the Cintas legacy First Aid business are better than Zee Medical, but we\u2019ve got a lot of integration to do and we want to see those things improve. I am not ready to quantify a synergy opportunity yet because I want to see more of the integration happen. Jason Rodgers : Okay, thanks. Operator : And we have no more questions at this time. Mike Hansen : Well thank you again for joining us tonight and we look forward to speaking with you again at the end of our second quarter and we\u2019ll issue our second quarter earnings in late December. Thank you. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Hansen : Good evening and thank you for joining us. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our second quarter results for fiscal 2016. And after our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We're pleased to report second quarter revenue of $1.219 billion, an increase of 8.5% from the prior-year second quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 6.5%. Organic revenue growth for Uniform Rental and Facility Services was 6.2%, and the First Aid and Safety Services organic growth was 9.8%. The performance of our sales force in both segments continues to be strong, with the solid improvement in the sales rep productivity. We are pleased with our ability to continue to add new customers and to provide existing customers with additional products and services from our broad line. Second quarter operating income was $200.3 million, an increase of 10.3% over last year's second quarter. Second quarter operating margin improved to 16.4% of revenue compared to an operating margin of 16.2% in the prior-year period. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment led the way with a margin of 18.1%. Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 was $115.5 million, compared to $103.7 million in the prior-year period. An increase of 11.3%. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue improved to 9.5% from 9.2% of revenue in last fiscal year's second quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 were $1.03 compared to $0.86 for the second quarter of last year. Second quarter fiscal 2016 EPS from continuing operations increased 19.8% compared to the prior-year period. We are on pace to achieve our sixth consecutive year of double-digit increases in EPS. As Cintas CEO Scott Farmer stated in today's press release, we're happy to again report strong increases in revenue, operating income and EPS. We thank our employees, whom we call partners, for continuously striving to exceed expectations. As a result of our second quarter results, we're updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal 2016 revenue to be in the range of $4.825 billion to $4.880 billion and fiscal 2016 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.83 to $3.90. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy or additional share buybacks. The EPS guidance is detailed in the table within today's press release. On December 4, we paid an annual dividend of $1.05 per share, totaling $115.5 million. The dividend per share was 23.5% more than last year's annual dividend of $0.85 per share, and was the 32nd consecutive year it have been increased. The dividend coupled with our share buyback program demonstrates our commitment to increasing shareholder value. As previously disclosed since the beginning of fiscal year 2016, Cintas repurchased about 4.5 million shares under our buyback program at an aggregate cost of $382.9 million, including $180.4 million of repurchases in the second quarter. The company still has $380 million available under the current Board of Directors stock repurchase authorization. Before Paul provides more details of company financial performance, I want to briefly address the impact of oil, gas, and coal on our results. We've talked a lot about the benefits of low fuel prices, but we've seen these low fuel prices affect our customers more than anticipated 90 days ago. U.S. oil rig counts are down over 60% compared to last year, and the price of oil has tumbled below $40 per barrel. We see the impact of headcount reductions in not only the oil industry, but also in gas and coal. We estimate that headcount reductions in these industries lowered our organic growth rate by about 75 basis points in the second quarter and reduced our operating margin by about 35 basis points. While low fuel prices still more than offset this bottom-line impact in the second quarter, we expect this net impact to be even or slightly negative in the second half of the year. I'll now turn the call over to Paul for additional information. Paul Adler : Thank you, Mike. First, please note that there were 65 workdays in this year's second quarter, same number of days as last year's second quarter. The same will hold true for the third quarter. However, this year's fourth quarter will have 66 workdays, compared to only 65 in last year's fourth quarter. In total, fiscal year 2016 will have 262 workdays, two more than in fiscal 2015. As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.5% in the second quarter. New business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services, customer retention, and price increases, all contributed to this solid growth rate. Total company gross margin was 43.3% for the second quarter of this year compared to 42.9% last year. Total company energy-related expenses for this year's second quarter were 2.0% of revenue compared to 2.6% of revenue in last year's second quarter. I will address the impacts of oil, gas, and coal and the recent ZEE Medical acquisition on gross margin at the operating segment level. Recall that effective June 1 of this year, we have three reportable operating segments : Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services, and All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business division. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $937.7 million, an increase of 5.2% compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, organic growth was 6.2%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 43.9% for the second quarter, an increase of 60 basis points from 43.3% in last year's second quarter. Energy-related costs were 50 basis points lower than in last year's second quarter. We estimate that job losses in oil, gas, and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year second quarter gross margin by 20 basis points. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, and training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $120.4 million, which was 46.4% higher than last year's second quarter. Total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. On an organic basis growth for the segment was 9.8%. This segment's gross margin was 43.2% in the second quarter compared to 46.7% in the prior-year period. The reduction in gross margin is wholly attributable to the impact of the recently acquired ZEE Medical business. Given that the acquisition occurred about four months ago, we are in the integration phase and incurring the customary costs of conversion. The assimilation of the business including route consolidation is now under way, which is integral to the realization of synergies. And we're pleased to report 90 basis points of improved gross margin on a sequential basis. We're excited about the benefits and opportunities this acquisition provides. First Aid and Safety is well on its way to becoming a $0.5 billion operating segment for us. Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 26.8% as a percentage of second quarter revenue, compared with total company SG&A in last year's second quarter of 26.7%. Medical expenses as a percentage of revenue were 10 basis points higher in this year's second quarter. Very soon, we will introduce an exciting new marketing campaign. The expense of the campaign began to be recognized in the second quarter. Its impact on SG&A was about 10 basis points. The related expense will continue through the end of the fiscal year with the greatest impact falling in our third quarter. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter was 37.4%, the same rate as in the prior-year period. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect the effective tax rate to be 37.3% in both the third and fourth quarters. For comparative purposes, the effective tax rate in last fiscal year's third and fourth quarters was 36.2% and 37.6%, respectively. On October 1 of this year, we sold our investment in Shred-it for $578.3 million before taxes. Cintas also has the opportunity to receive up to $34 million in additional consideration in the future, subject to certain holdback provisions. Note that the gain on sale of the investment is included in discontinued operations. The sale of the investment completes our exit from the document management business. As a result of both the shredding transactions and the sale of the documents storage business, we realized total proceeds of $1.100 billion on a segment that had annual revenue of about $316 million. That's a multiple of three times annual revenue. Our cash and marketable securities were $672.6 million as of November 30, an increase of $472.4 million from the balance as of August 31. Cash provided by operating activities was $122 million in our second quarter. Uses of cash in the quarter included $180.7 million for repurchases of Cintas common stock. As previously mentioned, $578.3 million was received in the quarter, as proceeds on the sale of the investment in Shred-it. Note that our cash will be used in part to pay the taxes on the gains on our Shred-it investment in our fiscal third quarter and fourth quarter. The amount of taxes to be paid is approximately $225 million. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were about $59 million. Our CapEx by reportable operating segments was as follows : $51 million in Uniform Rental, $3 million in First Aid and Safety, and $5 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million. That concludes our prepared marks. We're happy to answer your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Manav Patnaik : Yeah. Hi, good evening, gentlemen. I just wanted to just get a little bit more color on the energy, gas impact that you guys talked about. So you said 75 basis points to your organic growth for the total company, if I heard you right. So what is the assumption embedded in the full year guidance in terms of how that impacts your top-line number? Michael Hansen : Well, Manav, that \u2013 first, let me say that understanding this is not \u2013 the impact of this is not an exact science. So we said 75 basis points in the second quarter. And I would say in the second half of the year, we would expect roughly the same in the third quarter, 70 to 80 basis points. And then probably in the fourth quarter, about half of that, because we \u2013 the fourth quarter is when we started to see the negative impact from our customers last year. And so, if we continue at the current rate, we would expect that the year-over-year impact is going to be slightly smaller in the fourth quarter. Manav Patnaik : And is it fair to say that most of that is in the Rentals or is there some of that in the First Aid as well? Michael Hansen : There is some of that in the First Aid as well. We do have a very nice business in that industry from a First Aid and Safety standpoint. Manav Patnaik : Okay. And then just around sort of these impacts from layoffs and so forth, I mean we've been reading a lot of that happening on the industrial side of things. Can you remind us of your exposure there, or if you're seeing any of those come in more negatively than maybe you would have thought? Paul Adler : Yes. Manav, this is Paul. First, I would say that we've worked hard to diversify our customer base. And we've disclosed previously that we have no single customer that comprises more than 1% of our revenue. And we also don't have any three-digit [makes] [ph] code or industry code that comprises more than 10% of our revenue. And obviously, we have weathered the offshoring of all the U.S. jobs, U.S. manufacturing jobs years and years and years ago, and we continued to evolve. Now, we have more hygiene products than we ever had before. We have retail-inspired work wear like Carhartt that enables us to put people in uniform that previously did not want the program or were not interested in one. And we're in healthcare with scrub rental. So we continue to evolve, such that currently, our percentage of our customer base that is in the service-providing sector of the economy is about 70%. So about 30% of our customer base is in the goods-producing areas of the economy. And by goods-producing, I mean oil, gas, coal, construction, and manufacturing as well. So we obviously are reading the same press releases that you are. We understand the headwinds to U.S. manufacturing, and we're keeping an eye on it. But at the same time, we're trying to keep things in perspective. We do know that not every single one of our customers in manufacturing exports. And so, for many of those, they are receiving the benefits of lower energy prices and other low input costs to their cost structure like commodities, et cetera. So the bottom line is we're continuing to monitor it. But at this point in time, the only negative impact to our business that we see in this goods-producing sector of the economy is from oil, gas, and coal. Manav Patnaik : All right. Fair enough. That's really helpful. Thank you so much for all that color. Michael Hansen : You're welcome. Operator : We'll go next to George Tong with Piper Jaffray. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Can you discuss how add-stops performed in the quarter, both including oil and gas, and excluding oil and gas? Paul Adler : Yes. I would say there's two things that were noteworthy regarding adds and the stops in the quarter. And the first, of course, is the impact to our metric from the headcount reductions in the oil, gas, and coal. We definitely saw that negative impact in our flame-resistant garment add-stops metric. The second item of note was that we did have some softness in our add-stops as it relates to weather. If you recall last year, at this point in time, winter seemed like it had already arrived, and it's been a much milder fall and start to winter this year. And when we don't have that snow, we have fewer mat placements. And that cold weather also helps us to get some additional revenue change over into outerwear, jackets, long sleeves, et cetera. So it's hard to quantify, but we do know that there is some softness as a result of that seasonal fluctuation. George Tong : Got it. And so, would you characterize the add-stops as being overall positive low single-digits, negative? Michael Hansen : Well, George, the second quarter is generally a positive quarter from us because of some of the things that Paul mentioned, because of the seasonal nature of jackets and extra mat placements. So it was positive, but not as positive as last year, and due to the reasons that Paul cited. George Tong : Very helpful. And then can you discuss some plans to add to routes this year and how you expect route efficiency to evolve? Michael Hansen : We plan to add routes similarly to the way we've done in the last few years, and that is throughout the year. Our anticipation is to add routes to allow our drivers, our service sales reps, the time and the daily capacity to proactively serve our customers to look for up-selling opportunities, et cetera. And so I think we'll \u2013 we don't expect any dramatic changes in route efficiency this year compared to last year because in both years, we're going to be adding. George Tong : Got it. And then lastly, can you discuss the sustainability of a high single-digit organic growth in your First Aid and Safety segment, and how penetrated your customer base is with First Aid, i.e., what percentage of rental customers are also purchasing First Aid products? Michael Hansen : Far fewer than 20% of our Uniform Rental customers are purchasing First Aid and Safety Services from us. We think there's a lot of runway there. And we still believe that there are a lot of opportunities outside of our existing customer base as well. In that First Aid and Safety business, there are a lot of businesses today who are handling these issues themselves in-house, maybe going to a catalog company or to Wal-Mart to serve \u2013 to take care of their first aid and safety needs. And we believe that we can do it much, much more efficiently at a great value for them. But we've got a lot of opportunity there to get more into our programs, again both within our customer base and outside of our customer base. How long can we continue this high single, low double-digits? We believe into the future. We love the opportunity that the umbrellas of first aid, safety, and compliance bring us, and we think it's really a great business model for us and a great value proposition for businesses. George Tong : That's very helpful. Thank you. Michael Hansen : Okay. Operator : We'll go next to Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Gary Bisbee : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Michael Hansen : Hi, Gary. Gary Bisbee : It's sort of curious that with the All Other segment as you're calling it now having larger revenue and gross profit than First Aid and Safety that you don't provide any commentary. But I wondered if, at a minimum, you can give us the organic revenue growth for that segment in the quarter. Paul Adler : Yes, Gary, the organic growth was 6.1% in the quarter. And just remember that that All Other contains predominantly your fire protection services and then also contains our direct sale business, or our national account programs. And so just remember that that can be choppy just by the nature of that direct sale business with the fact that you have rollouts with large customer programs that don't, by their very nature, repeat. Gary Bisbee : Right, yeah. It looks like that -- is it fair to say that it gets a little tougher from the trend of that in the next couple of quarters? It looks like you've now grown solidly four quarters in a row. Michael Hansen : I would say that while it can be certainly a bumpy business, the direct sale, I don't know that I would say we're facing headwinds. We still expect good organic growth and improving operating margins. And keep in mind Gary, there are specific segment accounting rules that I think Paul went over last quarter that we have followed and will continue to follow as it relates to break out of the businesses. Gary Bisbee : Yeah. No, No, I was just \u2013 it was curious that you've given comments on the first two but not the third. But I understand it \u2013 no, I understand why. So, at any rate, moving on, just any updated color from what you said a quarter ago just on how we should think about the phasing of the integration of ZEE and the costs? Is it reasonable to think that that gross margin continues to decline sequentially like it did this quarter over the rest of the year, or is there anything that would make that more less in the near-term? Michael Hansen : It is reasonable. So we're about a quarter into that integration. It's going well as Paul mentioned. We are converting routes on to our SAP system. We are rebranding our trucks and that process is going very well. We like the improvements that we're seeing. We still have a lot of improvement opportunities and we would expect that sequentially, over the next several quarters, we'll continue to improve. We could have a little bumpiness here and there given the integration process, but generally speaking, yes, sequentially, going forward, we expect to see improvement, and we're excited about the opportunities that they bring. I would say that when we get to our July earnings release, we'll probably be in better position to speak to our thoughts going forward on the business. But as for this fiscal year, we're focused on the integration, and as I said, it continues to go well. Gary Bisbee : Thank you. Michael Hansen : You're welcome. Operator : We'll go next to Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Nate Brochmann : Good evening, guys. Congratulations on another good quarter. Michael Hansen : Thank you. Nate Brochmann : So I just want to talk two things. One, obviously, you guys have been getting a lot of sales productivity. Part of that is just a function of some of the process things; part of that is the ability to sell more. Just wondering how much more runway you think you have there before you might have to reload or kind of juice a little bit a hiring on the sales force front. Michael Hansen : Well, just, Nate, just as we are with our routes, we're consistently adding sales reps as well. We certainly understand that in order to keep growing, we do need to continue to expand. We believe that we have opportunities, that there are prospects available for us to continue to add. And the other great thing is, while we're adding, we're also seeing productivity improvements. And as you said, some of that is process and some of that's innovation that allows us \u2013 allows our sales reps to have more opportunities to sell. So, we're going to be adding, just as we have over the last few years. There have been times in the last several years, both in our sales reps and in our routes where we have increased the rate of additions in a quarter here or there, but absent that increased rate, we're generally adding because we want to continue to grow, we want to give capacity to our routes, we want to give \u2013 we want to get in front of more prospects and existing customers. Nate Brochmann : And then along those lines, in terms of some of those process/innovative improvements, are those ongoing in terms of constantly know very year, identifying a couple new tweaks that make those processes or those innovations better? Or has there been a couple one-time things that have had kind of oversize impact, or anything that might have an oversize impact over the next 12-18 months? Michael Hansen : Well, we're \u2013 a part of our culture is to continuously challenge ourselves and improve. And so I think we get incremental improvements every year, whether it's with the hiring of new reps and the profiles that we're looking for, whether it's the training that we do to get them ramped up as quickly as possible. The selling process itself, we're constantly looking for ways to improve. We do have a nice sales prospecting system that we put in, gosh, in the last year or so that is helping us. But I don't know that I'd see or care to share any other improvements that will be a leap forward in productivity levels in the next year or so. Nate Brochmann : Fair enough. And then just kind of a \u2013 kind of more industry question, but it feels that right now, things are kind of rational out there. I know it's always competitive pricing, but I was wondering if you could kind of comment a little bit on where you see industry pricing right now in terms of both renewals as well as for new awards. Paul Adler : Yeah, Nate, this is Paul. Pricing environment really hasn't changed significantly from last quarter. Still favorable overall, as we continue to talk about the value of our services and our products. But at the same time, it does remain competitive. National accounts are, in particular, more competitive than other business, and that's why we still focus on new business efforts around those no-programmers, those that have not had the program before, as we get the best value there. And that split, Nate, at still 60-40: 60% from no-programmers, 40% in terms of getting share from our competition. Nate Brochmann : Great. It sounds good. Thanks for the time. Michael Hansen : You're welcome. Operator : We'll go next to Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sara Gubins : Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Was the marketing campaign planned earlier and always contemplated in the guidance, or is that new? And could you tell us a little bit more about it? Michael Hansen : Let me make sure I understood that correctly. Did you ask if it was in the original guidance or... Sara Gubins : Yeah. I'm just wondering if it's something that's \u2013 I'm wondering if it's something that was \u2013 that is a new development over the course of this fiscal year or if it was something that you had always contemplated when you originally gave guidance for the fiscal year? Michael Hansen : Got it. We did contemplate it as we moved into the early in the fiscal year. And with something like a campaign, you can kind of turn it on and off a little bit, you can serve it to meet the needs, and we've done a little bit of that. And we didn't \u2013 because at the beginning of the year, there's \u2013 we've got so much of the year to go. We want to see how the beginning of the year goes before we commit to things. But the year has gone well so far. We did start spending on that campaign in the second quarter. I would expect as Paul said to see that expense go up in the third quarter. We're excited about the campaign. One of the things that we hear from our customers frequently is that, they didn't know that we can provide all of the different products and services that we do. So for example, we hear from Uniform Rental customers, gosh, I didn't know that you were in the first aid and safety business or I didn't know that you have \u2013 that you provide fire protection services. And so one of the goals is to raise awareness of all of the ways that we can provide value to our customers and we're excited about that. As it relates to more details, I would say stay tuned, but we're excited about that. Now, when we... Sara Gubins : Okay. Michael Hansen : When I mentioned that \u2013 and Paul mentioned, that we'll see a little bit more expense in the third quarter, let me speak a little bit to the second half of the year guidance. Paul touched on a few things in his opening comments. One is we may spend a little bit more on this marketing campaign in the third quarter. Secondly, our tax rate in the third quarter last year was less than what we're guiding towards this year in the third quarter. It was more in the fourth quarter last year than what we're guiding towards. So that's going to have a year-over-year impact, so slightly negative in the third, maybe a little bit positive in the fourth. And then the last thing I would point to as it relates to the second half of the year guidance is that we have one more work day in the fourth quarter than we do in the third quarter. And so when you take all three of those things and you think about our guidance and you think about your modeling, I would suggest that the fourth quarter is going to be weighted more heavily in terms of profitability than the third quarter is. So, sorry for that [indiscernible]. Sara Gubins : Okay. Great. Thank you. No, that's very helpful. Thank you. I think that before, you talked about energy cost being \u2013 expecting them to be about 2.5% of revenue this year. I'm guessing that now you expect that they will be lower. What are you anticipating for energy costs this year as a percent of revenue? Paul Adler : Yes, Sara, the guidance for the remainder of the year assumes that we're going to remain at that same percent of revenue that we are in Q2, which was that 2.0%. Sara Gubins : Okay, great. And then just last question about margins for from rental. I know there are a lot of puts and takes given the marketing campaign, given the pressure from energy clients. Is it fair to assume that the margin expansion you saw in the second quarter is \u2013 on a year-over-year basis is about what we should expect to see in the back half? Or would we even maybe potentially see less because of the marketing campaign ramping? Michael Hansen : And so, if we think about the overall operating margin, I think that we expect that we'll get some continued margin improvement in the back half of the year. It is going to be a little bit pressured, though, because the year-over-year benefit of energy is going to decrease, probably if \u2013 assuming that 2% rate is down to 40 basis points in the third and 20 basis points in the fourth, and that negative impact from oil and gas customers will start to become a bigger part of the net number, if you will. So while we do expect to continue to improve margins, I would say that given the pressure of that alone, we might be a little \u2013 we might see a little bit of narrowing in the second half of the year. Sara Gubins : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : We'll go next to Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird. Andrew Wittmann : Hey, guys. So, Mike, just to build on this, and sorry for beating a dead horse, but is it the growth investments that you're making that's preventing more operating leverage from coming through? I mean ex-energy here, obviously there wasn't a whole lot here. It seems like there could be more, but it's \u2013 is it just really more reinvestment in the business that's holding you back from putting up [indiscernible] margin gains higher than this, given that organic growth has been excellent? Michael Hansen : Well, so, Andy, keep in mind that you can't just take the energy benefit, the 60 basis points year-over-year and say that that is the only impact from energy. We are seeing our oil and gas customers being negatively impacted, probably to a larger extent in the second quarter than we anticipated 90 days ago. So, certainly, that low fuel price is having an offset, and we're seeing some of that. On the other hand, we are \u2013 we will continue to invest in the business. And you are correct : some of that \u2013 I mean, if we pulled back on investment, we could certainly make margins get higher. But we want to keep investing in the business, and we'll continue to do that going forward. Andrew Wittmann : With the medical being \u2013 thank you for that. With ZEE Medical now being four months in, and actually, sequentially showing some less-tier \u2013 is this one of the reasons for the guidance? It's like, Mike, before, you were saying kind of zero contribution, but it seems like it might to be off to a little bit better start than that. Is that true or how will you break down the guidance hike? Michael Hansen : I would say that the guidance hike is a bit on second quarter performing pretty well, and maybe a little bit slightly better than we anticipated, and then just a firming of how we feel about the overall business including the First Aid and Safety improvements. So while I wouldn't put a lot into saying that the ZEE is going much better than we expected, it's going well, and it's going fairly closely to as we expected, and maybe a little bit of that improvement could come from ZEE. But I think it's the combination of feeling really good about the second quarter performance and seeing that move into the second half of the year. Andrew Wittmann : Thanks. Maybe the last question, then, like on \u2013 you picked up an acquisition or some assets from one of your competitors in a court proceeding in the past few months here. I was just wondering if you could give us some help on how that's going to flow through your income statement, including what you expect in terms of the revenue contribution maybe on a go-forward basis, or even what it was in the second quarter? Any financial numbers, color on that transaction, I think, would be helpful for shareholders. Michael Hansen : Sure. On December 4, we closed an acquisition of Coyne Textile Services. Coyne was in bankruptcy proceedings. We did not buy all of the business; we bought only a part of the business. It's a little bit of a different kind of acquisition for us; first time we bought a business out of bankruptcy. And so, we're in the midst of integrating that, and because it's in \u2013 because it was in bankruptcy, obviously it probably wasn't the strongest business that we've every acquired. And so we want to make sure we understand how it rolls in, but it's \u2013 we paid about $33.6 million for the acquisition. We believe that it will provide about $25 million to $30 million of annual revenue. We're in the midst of integrating that into quite a few different rental facilities where it's a really nice tuck-in opportunity. We have contemplated that into the guidance. And I would say from a top line perspective a couple things to keep in mind, while we have contemplated that into the guidance, we have also seen the impact of the Canadian dollar weakening a little bit more than we anticipated 90 days ago. And as we talked about oil and gas, that impact, negative impact is a little bit higher than we anticipated 90 days ago as well. And so when you combine those three things together, we feel like the right thing to do is to leave the top end of the guidance where it is, but we feel good enough about the operating environment to move that bottom end of the guidance, revenue guidance up $25 million. From an EPS standpoint, that acquisition kind of fits into, again, getting a better feel for where we are at the middle of the year. And while we might see some benefit, we are \u2013 from a bottom-line standpoint, we really need to see what we've got coming out of the holidays before we can adequately assess that business's impact. Andrew Wittmann : That's really helpful. Thank you very much. Michael Hansen : Okay. Operator : We'll go next to John Healy with Northcoast Research. John Healy : Thank you. Mike, I wanted to ask a little bit just to get some more color on how you're feeling about the holidays and how they'll impact the business. With Christmas week on, plant shutdowns and whatnot over the \u2013 at the end of the year could be quite volatile and just kind of any initial early read on how those might trend to the last year and maybe the prior years. Michael Hansen : No initial signs that it will be different from the previous years. I will tell you that we're cautious about the way we view this economy. And coming out of the holidays, we're a little bit probably more cautious than we thought we would've been 90 days ago. But we still feel good about our ability to execute in this environment. I think, John, a little bit more as it relates to the holiday, and then rolling into January-February, I think a little bit more has to do with the weather. We'd like to see a little bit cooler weather to add more jackets; a little bit of \u2013 a little bit more rain and snow will add some more mat placements. That, we'd like to see, and probably has us watching more closely than any shutdowns during the holiday period. John Healy : Got you. And on the direct sales business, I think this is around the time of the year, or maybe it was a few weeks, that usually starts some of those outerwear promotions. Is the outlook for the direct sales business a little bit more \u2013 a little bit softer than maybe you would've thought 90 days ago just given the weather, and that's kind of business that you just won't be able to recoup? Michael Hansen : I would say that while there is a little bit of that, yes. We do have a lot of good projects in the pipeline in that business and our expectation is that we'll see an offset. So I don't anticipate any unusual softness in that business in the next six months. John Healy : Okay, great. And then just one final question. I know you touched on a bit about the new marketing campaigns. I was hoping you could maybe give us a little bit color in terms of how you're trying to reach the customer. Is it a different \u2013 is it more of a different message or is it a different way. Maybe you're going more to social media or maybe you're going to the television commercials. Any way you can maybe talk to how the ad campaign attempts to reach the small business customer who is putting your services on the shelf? Michael Hansen : John, I would say we're looking at ways to get as many touches as we possibly can, but I'd rather not get into too many details. I would just say stay tune and we'll talk about it certainly more at our third quarter call. John Healy : Great. Have a great holiday. Michael Hansen : Thank you. You too. Operator : We'll go next to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. Good evening, guys. Michael Hansen : Hi, Scott. Scott Schneeberger : Hey. Going back, you highlighted 70% of the business is really a lot of service customers, and then 30%, I think you've said oil, gas, coal, construction, manufacturing was the brunt of the that. And thank you very much for the color you provided on oil, gas, coal. I heard some cautionary remarks on construction, manufacturing saying those domestically \u2013 who don't export are doing okay, but what's in the guidance? Is it \u2013 going back on the guidance overall, what effects those first three components that are more commodity components, is that basically if the current commodity prices remain the same is how you're thinking about the guidance? And then part of the question too is if you could just elaborate on the concern you discussed on construction and manufacturing, was that just reading headlines like the rest of us? Was it the import-export? And is that petering on being something that could go incrementally worse? Thanks. Michael Hansen : So our guidance contemplates that the environment that we see today continues. And I would say that we have \u2013 throughout our second quarter, we did see our oil, gas, mining customers being more negatively impacted than in the previous quarters. But I would say we haven't seen it extend to any significant degree outside of that. We didn't see that in our second quarter. And I think what Paul was referring to is that we're not convinced that we're in an industrial recessionary environment. We certainly know that the strong dollar can have some impact on certain types of manufacturing and certain types of customers, but we also know that it's a benefit to others. And our thoughts are generally that the current operating environment will continue in the second half of the year. And while we're cautious and maybe a little bit more so than 90 days ago, we still feel good about this operating environment and in our ability to achieve the guidance in this environment. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. And a moment ago, when you mentioned that forex, obviously a headwind, could you remind us what your mix of international revenue is? I believe it's predominantly Canada. And I recall you went a little bit international in hospitality just to follow customers a few years back. And given these conditions \u2013 so, international mix is the first part, but the second of the question would be how are you thinking about M&A abroad right now, just expansion. And I guess particularly within Canada. Thanks. Michael Hansen : Well, so, I would say 6% to 7% of our total revenue is international, most of which is in Canada. We have primarily our Rental business in Canada. We do have a direct sale business that is not significant, but certainly part of that business. And with the ZEE acquisition, we just got into Canada. That is a \u2013 not a significant amount of the ZEE business either, but all of that combined, probably 6%-ish in Canada, 1% or less everywhere else. And so, let me pause, did I answer your question Scott? Scott Schneeberger : Yeah. And the follow-up would just be appetite on M&A, I guess, in general? Michael Hansen : Yes, M&A. So from an international standpoint, because of some of the document management divestitures, we do have about $100 million of cash outside of the U.S. And we'd certainly look for good opportunities to make investments, for example with the ZEE business. We paid for the Canadian business with Canadian dollars \u2013 with international dollars. So we'd love to continue to do that kind of acquisition opportunity. As it relates to M&A, in general, so in the U.S., primarily, the pipeline has been good for us in the first six months or so of the fiscal year. We made the ZEE acquisition in August, we made this Coyne acquisition in early December, and we would love to continue to make acquisitions like these two that are great tuck-in opportunities where we feel like we can get really good incremental margins. Scott Schneeberger : Great. I appreciate it guys. Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Thank you for squeezing me in at the end of here. Most of my questions have been answered, I just have a couple. Could you give a little bit more specificity on the percentage of the revenues, especially from just like oil, gas, and mining? Maybe just honing in on that, is there a number that you can give us? Michael Hansen : A lot \u2013 about a year ago, Shlomo, we talked about that being 2% to 3%; let's call it 3%-ish. I would say given the course of the events over the last year, that business is smaller than 3%. Our other businesses have grown and continued growing, and that business has not. So it's still a fairly small block of business for us, but it has suffered quite a bit. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. So we're talking about it's like 3% going down maybe a little less than a 1% in terms of total revenue. Just looking at materiality? Michael Hansen : I don't know that's going down that much, Shlomo, but probably in the 2%-ish. Shlomo Rosenbaum : No, I don't mean, 2%-1%. I'm saying it may be dropping from 3% to 2%. Michael Hansen : Oh, yes, correct. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And then there's a fair amount of cash on the balance sheet from Shred-it, and outside of paying Uncle Sam, is it that the intention to use for more of these type of acquisitions or should we \u2013 if we're thinking about prioritizing on that, would you think \u2013 should we be continuing to model in a certain level of share repurchases as you guys have been doing for a while now? Michael Hansen : So, a couple of comments on cash. Yes, there is a lot on our balance sheet at November 30. A couple of things again, about a $100 million of that is outside of the U.S. So to bring that into the U.S. would be fairly costly. We did spend a $115.5 million on our dividend in the first week of December. That was a dividend of a $1.05, which was a 23.5% increase, so we are happy to share that with our shareholders. We did make the Coyne acquisition that closed on December 4 to just over $33 million. And as Paul said, we've got a \u2013 you'll see on the balance sheet about a $236 million income taxes payable that will happen in February. So those last three items we're going to be spending just under $400 million on those alone. So while there is a lot of cash on the balance sheet at November 30, there are plans for a good chunk of that. Having said that, we'll continue to generate cash. We would love to put that cash to work in accretive acquisitions, similar to ZEE and Coyne. And we'll keep looking for those opportunities. That certainly is our highest priority. But if there aren't good opportunities and we believe that the share buyback program is appropriate, we've certainly got a track record of showing that we will put that cash to work. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Great. Thank you. Michael Hansen : Okay. And we'll go next to Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman : Hi there. I just wanted to quantify a little bit more about the sales administrative line. It was under 27% of revenues, which is towards the low historically, and I definitely heard it's going to bump up at the marketing campaign. My question is just what's a normal sales and administrative percentage while revenues continue to grow at a healthy rate? Will we stay in this kind of 27% range in leverage or do you think over time that has to kind of go back towards 28%? Michael Hansen : A couple of comments and thoughts. You may see from a First Aid perspective, we're getting really nice G&A leveraging from the ZEE Medical acquisition. That's a business that \u2013 where we didn't bring a lot of G&A and overhead across, and that's why we'd like that opportunity so much. So we've seen some real nice leveraging there. Yet a marketing campaign is a little bit of a blip in the second half of our fiscal year, but I would say going into the fiscal 2017 and then even more so in fiscal 2018, we're going to have the SAP project concluding and beginning to depreciate. And so we will see some impact of that in the next two fiscal years. Absent that, we absolutely believe that we should be and believe we can grow SG&A at a slower rate than our revenue growth, and we expect that every single year. And so absent the couple of callouts, we expect to get leveraging in the G&A area every single year. So getting back to, is 28% the right number, Andrew \u2013 or is 27%, 28% is right number, we need to see a little bit more of how our First Aid business operates with the ZEE integration. And I think next year will be a better indicator. Andrew Steinerman : Okay. Thank you. Michael Hansen : Okay. Operator : At this time, we have no further questions. So I hand the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Michael Hansen : Well, thank you all for joining us tonight, and we wish you all a happy holiday. We will issue our third quarter earnings in late March. And we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you. Good night. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Baird John Healy - Northcoast Research Adrian Paz - Piper Jaffray Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Hansen : Good evening and thank you for joining us. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2016. After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We're pleased to report third quarter revenue of $1,216 billion, an increase of 9.7% from the prior year's third quarter. Organic revenue growth which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 6.8%. Organic growth for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 6.1% and the First Aid and Safety Services organic growth was 11.9%. Third quarter operating income was $193 million, an increase of 11.1% over last year's third quarter. Operating margin improved to 15.9% of revenue compared to an operating margin of 15.7% in the prior year period. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment led the way with a margin of 17.9%. Net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 was $117 million compared to $100 million in the prior year period, an increase of 16.9%. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue improved to 9.6% from 9.0% of revenue in last fiscal year's third quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the third quarter were $1.05 compared to $0.85 from the third quarter of last year. Third quarter EPS from continuing operations increased 23.5% compared to the prior-year period. As a result of a third quarter results, we are updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal 2016 revenue to be in the range of $4,860 billion to $4,890 billion, and fiscal 2016 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.98 to $4.03. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the US economy or additional share buybacks. The EPS guidance is detailed in the table within today's press release. Since the beginning of fiscal year 2016, Cintas repurchased about 5.7 million shares under our buyback program at an aggregate cost of about $483 million, including $100 million of repurchases in the third quarter. The company still has $280 million available under the current Board of Directors stock repurchase authorization. Before Paul provides more details of company financial performance, I want to take the opportunity to thank our employees, whom we call partners, for an outstanding job. We are proud of our strong financial results. We expect fiscal 2016 to be our sixth consecutive year of double-digit increases in EPS. Our organic growth rates are well in excess of the growth rates in US gross domestic product and employment, and we continue to both sell new accounts and add value to existing customers by addressing their specific business needs. We have distinct competitive advantages. Our corporate culture which guides and drives everything that we do. Our innovative and expansive product line that is comprised of many proprietary products that cannot be offered by our competition. And an unmatched scale that provides unique leveraging opportunities, global sourcing capabilities and the best and broadest service structure in North America. These competitive advantages have led to our history of strong financial results and have made us the clear leader in our industry. We are significantly larger than our competitors. We are growing faster and our margins are better. These strong financial results, our unmatched scale and our focus on the long-term, allow us to invest in ways not possible for our competitors. We are continuously engaged in the research and development of new products and services. This is evident in the breadth of the product and service offerings compared to others in the industry. We are able to embark on a national branding campaign visible on television. Our new tagline, Ready for the Workday, speaks to the value we provide our customers in helping them prepare for their workdays. This campaign is resulting in greater brand awareness to assist with cross selling efforts. It\u2019s also energizing our partners who are now even more ready for our customers. And we are able to make transformative investments, such as our conversion to the SAP system. I'll discuss the status of the SAP project in a few minutes, after Paul provides more third quarter details. But these investments will continue to strengthen our industry leading position and ensure that we continue into the future helping many, many businesses get Ready for the Workday. I'll now turn the call over to Paul for additional information. Paul Adler : Thank you, Mike. First please note that there were 65 workdays in this year's third quarter, the same number of days as last year's third quarter. However, this year's fourth quarter will have 66 workdays compared to only 65 in last year's fourth quarter. In total, fiscal year 2016 will have 262 workdays, 2 more than in fiscal 2015. Finally, note that our next fiscal year of 2017 will have one less day than this year. We estimate that this one less day will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.8% in the third quarter. This solid growth rate was driven largely by new business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and strong customer retention. Total company gross margin was 43.1% for the third quarter of this year compared to 42.9% last year. Total company energy-related expenses, including gas, diesel, and natural gas for this year's third quarter were 1.8% of revenue, about 50 basis points lower than last year's third quarter. Note however, that we continued to see the impact of headcount reduction in the oil, gas and coal industries. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from customers in these industries lowered our organic growth rate by about 80 basis points in the third quarter and reduced our operating margin by about 40 basis points. So on a net basis, the low fuel prices benefited our operating margin by about 10 basis points. Recall that effective June 1st of this year, we have three reportable operating segments : Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services, and all other. All other consists primarily of fire protection services and our direct sale business division. First Aid and Safety Services and all other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $936 million, an increase of 6.0% compared to last year's third quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and acquisitions, organic growth was 6.1%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.0% for the third quarter, an increase of 70 basis points from 43.3% in last year's third quarter. Energy-related costs were 50 basis points lower than in last year's third quarter. We estimate that job losses in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year third quarter operating margin by about 40 basis points. So on a net basis, the low fuel prices benefited our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin by about 10 basis points. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $119 [ph] million, which was 50% higher than last year's third quarter. Total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. On an organic basis, growth for the segment was 11.9%. This segment's gross margin was 42.2% in the third quarter, compared to 47.3% in the prior year period. Operating income margin was 10.6% compared to 14.2% in last year's third quarter. The reduction in margins is wholly attributable to the impact of the recently acquired ZEE Medical business. We are in the integration phase and incurring the typical conversion costs. The assimilation of the business, including route consolidation is in process. The completion of which is integral to the realization of synergies. We are excited about the benefits and opportunities that will result upon completion of the integration in about six months. Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 27.3% as a percentage of third quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's third quarter of 27.2%. Medical expenses as a percentage of revenue were 10 basis points higher in this year's third quarter. Also note that our new national branding campaign impacted SG&A by about 45 basis points. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter was 33.8% compared to 36.3% for last year's third quarter. A prior year federal tax audit closed during the quarter with favorable results. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 to be about 36.5%. Our cash and marketable securities were $386 million as of February 29, a decrease of $286 million from the balance as of November 30. Uses of cash in the quarter included $115 million for the dividend, $100 million for repurchases of Cintas common stock and $166 million to pay some of the taxes due on the gains related to the sale of our Shred-it investment. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were about $85 million. Our CapEx by reportable operating segment was as follows, $76 million in Uniform Rental, $6 million in First Aid and Safety, and $3 million in all other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $270 million to $300 million. Before we open the call up for questions, I'd like to turn the call back to Mike who will provide some additional information related to investments and SAP. Mike? Mike Hansen : Thanks Paul. Our investment in the SAP system began years ago. We first converted to SAP in our accounting and finance functions. We soon followed that conversion with the implementation of portions of our global supply chain, including production planning and sourcing. With this experience under our belt, we put our first operating business into SAP, our Document Shredding business, and then our First Aid and Safety business. Over the past 2 years, we have been communicating our efforts to convert our largest operating division, Uniform Rental and Facility Services to SAP, which is a capital investment of approximately $100 million. We started with the blueprinting phase, which was designing the system. About a year ago, we moved into the realization phase, which was building the system and testing at. At this time, we expect to complete this realization phase in the next three to four months and then move into the pilot stage. The great news is we've been able to maintain the project costs and time line that we introduced two years ago with minimal changes. I want to say thanks to all of our partners working on this project. They've done and continue to do a tremendous job. In fact, we feel good enough with our progress to date that we've made decisions to extend the footprint of the SAP system into our distribution network and expand our e-commerce capabilities. We anticipate that these extensions will be a capital investment of roughly $40 million over the next year or so. Given the progress made and proximity to implementation, we have better visibility and are now able to share with you the estimated impacts to our fiscal years 2017 and 2018. We expect to begin depreciating the rental capital project around December of 2016. Therefore, our fiscal year 2017 will include about a half of a year of depreciation. It will also include about half of a year of system maintenance costs. The conversion of hundreds of our operations to SAP will occur during fiscal 2017 and extend through fiscal 2018. Training costs, which are expensed when incurred as opposed to amortized over time, will exist in both fiscal '17 and '18. As is customary in such a conversion, we expect to have additional - other additional costs in 2017 and 2018 as a result of inefficiencies until the old system is completely offline. We estimate that the investment in SAP will result in $30 million to $35 million of expense in fiscal 2017 and $45 million to $50 million of expense in fiscal 2018. We will begin to realize some cost structure benefits in fiscal 2019, but will likely see the power of the system beginning in fiscal 2020, once all operations have had some experience in running it. This is a transformational investment and we are confident it will be successful. We've seen many companies, including some in our own industry, struggle with these large implementation projects. Our financial strength and commitment to the long-term has enabled us to dedicate the required internal resources to the project in every phase. We also have the best external resource assisting us as SAP and not a third-party consulting firm has been working with us every step of the way. And as previously mentioned, we have a great experience with SAP from our prior implementations. We look forward to the long-term benefits this investment will provide. That concludes our prepared remarks and we'll now be happy to answer any questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question with Joe Box from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Joe Box : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Mike Hansen : Hi, Joe. Paul Adler : Hi, Joe. Joe Box : I just wanted to dig into the 6.1% organic growth rate in uniform. I know you guys usually wait until 4Q to give us a little bit more detail on the breakout of that segment. But can you maybe just talk to were there any noticeable differences in the growth rate between the 52% that\u2019s uniform and the 48% that is other or any directional trends between the two? Mike Hansen : Well, we've talked a little bit, Joe, about the issues that we've had in the oil and gas sector. Outside of that though, we haven\u2019t seen much of a change in the operating environment. And I would say that our sales continue to be broad-based in terms of the different verticals that we're selling to and the different products and services that we're actually selling. And so we haven\u2019t seen much of a change with the exception of the oil and gas that continues to be problematic and has deteriorated even further in this third quarter. Joe Box : Got you. So it's fair to say that there's not any sort of moderation above and beyond within the uniform only component relative to where you were at over the last quarter or two? Mike Hansen : No, and I think the organic growth is fairly consistent with the last quarter, second quarter which was at 6.2%. And so, no, we haven\u2019t seen a lot of change in the economic environment, and based on our guidance, we still feel pretty good about going forward. Joe Box : Got it. Thanks for that. And then Mike, I appreciate the commentary on the breadth of your products earlier. How should we think about the pace of new product intros going into hygiene, first aid, non-uniform markets? Are you seeing an accelerating pace there based on the new workday campaign? Mike Hansen : Well, I think from a campaign standpoint, first of all, Cintas and all of our partners are very energized by the campaign. We are really excited about it and it really speaks well of the value that we offer. I would say that reactions though, to the campaign are primarily anecdotal. We hear a lot of good news from our locations. But it\u2019s too early to tell whether that\u2019s having any impact on our current results. I think we'll know more about that as we go through the next several quarters. But getting back to the products and services, you know, Joe, we spend a lot of time in terms of innovation. And we invest a lot in R&D to find the right products that can solve problems for our customers. And again, I think that speaks to our new tagline, Ready for the Workday. And you know, Joe, when we think about the products and services, we've got retail inspired products, like Carhartt and our wrinkle free garments that people want to wear. We've got customer focused solutions like our scrub rental programs and our chemical cleaning solutions. And the beautiful thing about these products are they are all proprietary. All of these that I have mentioned are proprietary and cannot be offered by anybody else in the industry. We will - when we introduce a new product, we've got 900,000 or so customers out there that are warm leads. And even though they are warm leads, we don\u2019t get fully penetrated overnight. It takes a while to educate our people on it, on selling new products, and then it takes a little bit of time to sell it to our customers. But having said that, we've been able to grow quite a bit above, as I said GDP and employment and the industry because in part we've created innovative products and services that our customers want. And I would say that we've also - we've got a very, very, diverse customer base and that diversity has really helped us. You see others in our industry who are really suffering because of less diversity. We've got a very diverse customer base. And part of that is on design and part of it is we have products and services that reach farther and reach broader than our competition. So we're going to continue to penetrate our existing customers with our products that we have, and we've got a lot of runway with those. We will also continue to work on R&D. I am not ready to announce any new products. But, Joe, we feel really good about our ability to continue to grow better than GDP, better than employment, better than the industry, because we are innovative. We've got a broader product line. We've got a diverse customer base, and we've got a great penetration opportunity. We think that has served us very well in the past and will continue to serve us into the future. Joe Box : Got it. Thanks for all the color on that. Just one real quick one, relative to the stronger dollar, the impact is pretty clear on the Canadian business. I'm just curious though, if there is more broadly an opportunity to maybe source your garments better? Mike Hansen : Well, Joe, I would say there's always - we would tell our global supply chain people, there are always ways we can improve and I think they believe that as well. The Canadian impact that you are referring to was primarily a top line impact. We haven't seen a significant bottom line impact. But, yes, there are certainly sourcing opportunities. The good news is we've got a great global supply chain and they are \u2013 they source globally and they are very flexible. We do not own a lot of our manufacturing. And so this group brings us lots of value. And I would say there are always ways to improve, whether it's new technology, new sources or just changes in mix and volume. We certainly think there are opportunities. Joe Box : Appreciate it. Thanks, guys. Operator : We'll take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is actually Greg calling on for Manav. I just want to ask about the cross sell opportunity between the First Aid and Safety business and the Uniform business? I think you talked about 20% penetration on the last call. Just wondering how you guys are thinking about accelerating that and whether getting this ERP system in place will help to do that? Mike Hansen : We do think that - a couple things, our First Aid and Safety business is doing a great job of digesting the ZEE acquisition. But keep in mind that\u2019s a fairly large acquisition for them. It was more than a third of the legacy Cintas First Aid and Safety business. That\u2019s priority number one. But clearly, yes, when we are on the SAP system, one of the benefits is that all of our operations will have more visibility and clarity into our customers and the different products and services that they have or don't have. And so we really do believe one of the real big benefits of the SAP system is to improve that penetration. But having said that, hey look, we feel really good about the First Aid and Safety business altogether. We know that we've got, as Paul said, two more quarters of integration; the integration is going well. Our margins are down from a year ago. We certainly understand that and certainly some of that is due to integration costs. And others are just due to a different business. We're integrating a different business than Cintas is. And we have penetration opportunities. And when we think about that organic growth that we saw this quarter of 11.9%, we're really excited about that. Our people in the First Aid and Safety business have still been able to focus on selling and servicing the customers, as well as starting to get into this the ZEE penetration opportunities. We talk a lot about the penetration opportunities for our rental business. But our ZEE customers generally have been only First Aid cabinet customers. And with our First Aid business, we have the ability or the opportunity to expand into safety products, training services, AEDs, et cetera. And so have - we feel like we've got a good penetration opportunity there and I think our 11.9% organic growth speaks to that a little bit. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. That makes a lot of sense. Also just wanted to kind of level set, I guess, on energy. It sounded like it came in pretty close to what you were saying with the 80 basis point headwind on the top line and I guess, 1.8% of cost. Is the expectation for the fourth quarter still half as much of an impact on the top line and then that 1.8% on the cost side? Paul Adler : Yes, Greg, it\u2019s Paul. On the top line, from the customer and the headcount reductions, that about half of the impact from Q3 to be experienced in Q4 is a good figure. In terms of the energy, the cost side of it, though, I think the price per barrel really dropped low in our third quarter, I think it reached $26 at one point. It\u2019s kind of rebounded through the $40 threshold. So I think if it stays at about that level our energy as a percent of our revenue would probably be more in line with our Q2, which was about 2.0% of revenue. And in Q4 last year, our energy was about 2.2%. So the bottom line is we're expecting probably about 20 basis points of benefits from the prices at the pump. But then really offset by the headcount reductions that we expect to continue to incur into Q4. Unidentified Analyst : Right. Okay, that makes sense. And I guess the last one, just from a modeling perspective, the organic growth in all other would you guys be able to give that? Mike Hansen : Yes. So Greg, it was about 8.2% for the quarter. And it\u2019s a strong year-to-date as well. All other, just as a reminder, includes that direct sale business and our fire protection business. That direct sale business is typically a slow grower relative to everything else we have, meaning 3%, 4%. So for that organic growth to be as high as it was in that all other segments, that fire protection business is growing quite nicely. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : We'll next go to Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Nate Brochmann : Yes, good evening, gentlemen. Mike Hansen : Hi, Nate. Nate Brochmann : So I wanted to talk a little bit more about the campaign. I know you won't really be able to look back in the rear view mirror for a while to see the impact. Have you - is that still going on the same timeline that you originally thought that it would or has that extended at all? And then second question, to my knowledge at least since covering you, that this is the first big huge national campaign that you've ever embarked on, and if that is true, why the timing was kind of right to do that? Mike Hansen : So a couple things. It is following the timeline that we originally established and thought of. I would expect that the spend on this campaign is going to be a bit lower, quite a bit lower in our fourth quarter and likely ramp up again next fiscal year, second quarter-ish. So it is following the original timeline that we had established. This is the largest and the first national campaign certainly that includes television. And it is the largest campaign that we've ever done. And so, why now? Look, we think it\u2019s the right time to continue to get our brand awareness greater and greater throughout the country. We've had many customers over the years say to us, gosh, I didn't know you did that. I didn't know that you did first aid and safety. I didn't know that you had fire protection services. I didn't know you had chemical cleaning services. And the more we heard this, we kept thinking we need to educate. And so we thought that, look, now is a great time to do this because we've got some businesses that are really doing well and executing well. We've got a lot of great products, a lot of fairly new products and we want to get the word out to many, many businesses in North America that when those businesses have issues, need problems solved, think about calling Cintas. They can maybe help us get Ready for the Workday. And so we think it's a great time to do that because we're executing well. We've got a lot of good products and services, and we think its going to give us some momentum going into the future. Nate Brochmann : Okay. Great for that. And then just kind to circle back on the end market questions a little bit, just to dive in one layer deeper. But at this point, obviously, I would assume that you feel that you kind of have your arm around the oil and gas headcount reductions. Obviously, by kind of giving where we probably are going to go in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, I would assume that\u2019s the case. And also based on your earlier commentary regarding some of the other end markets, I would assume you are not seeing any further weakness in kind of maybe some of your industrial end markets, is that all fair to say? Paul Adler : That\u2019s correct, Nate. As far as oil and gas, right, we believe we have a handle on for Q4 in terms of the quantification. We wish we had our hands around it in terms of thinking and believing that it was at the bottom. But those rig counts that we continue to monitor continue to decline and they are probably down about 60% year-over-year. So we'll continue to watch that into next fiscal year. And then in terms of manufacturing, it continues to be positive for us. We believe that more of our customers in the sector are stable or growing as opposed to shrinking. But, of course, we understand the headwinds that are out there and the industry statistics. So we'll continue to monitor it. But, yes, you nailed it, at this point in time the only negative impact in any particular sector is from oil and gas and coal as well. Nate Brochmann : Sure. Okay. That's great. And then one last, if I could squeeze it in. We talked about, obviously, and \u2013 I mean, it's the way everything goes with the SAP and congratulations for not having any major hiccups so far, knock on wood. But with some of those costs that you're anticipating going into next fiscal year and the following, are there any potential offsets? And I mean, I know every day you're always working on productivity improvements and efficiency improvements via technology or whatnot. But is there anything on the horizon that might give us a little bit of an offset to that, that would be above the norm or would there be any potential upside from any synergy benefits related to ZEE? Mike Hansen : Well, are there any benefits related - synergy benefits related to ZEE? That's a little bit of an independent question. Yes, we absolutely think there are and that will be \u2013 we'll incorporate those thoughts into our guidance for fiscal '17 in July. So, yes, we do think that ZEE and the first aid margins are certainly going to improve. From an SAP standpoint, let's keep in mind this is the largest project that we've ever done. As we've kind of come to the end of this realization phase and we've been testing the project, we're really starting to see the power of the system and we're excited about getting this implemented. And we believe that there is the power in the system that we hoped for. We certainly still see that there are long-term benefits. But having said that, we're not going to take any shortcuts in this implementation. We're going to make sure we do it the right way with no adverse impact to our customers. And one of the risk mitigating things about the way we are rolling this out is that we've got hundreds of operations that need to be converted and they effectively happen one at a time. And so its not like we turn it on and our entire rental segment goes live. We have to do this one at a time. Now that mitigates the risk to us. But it extends the rollout a little bit as well through that fiscal '18. And so we - look, we think we're doing this the right way. As I mentioned, we've seen others, both in our industry and outside of our industry struggle with these and we feel fully confident that, that\u2019s not going to happen to us. Now, certainly those numbers that I gave you are fairly large, and as you know, Nate, we're not going to sit idly by and just let those fall to the bottom. We are going to manage the impact as best we can. We are going to control our cost structure and we're going to become as efficient as we can become in the next couple of years. Now in fiscal '17, look, we're going to be on probably less than half of our locations and I would not expect that we're going to see a lot of system benefit. In fiscal '18 we might start to see a little bit of system benefit. But it\u2019s going to be muted because we're going to still be converting quite a few locations. But having said that again, Nate, we're not going to sit idly by and just let $30 million to $35 million drop to the bottom without really managing the impact through our cost structure, through efficiency gains, et cetera. And will we be able to offset all $30 million to 35 million? No, but we will do our best to manage that impact. Nate Brochmann : That sounds great. Thanks for the added color, Mike. I appreciate that. Mike Hansen : No problem. And you know, we \u2013 look, do not do things for the short term. So this is a transformational system that\u2019s going to carry us for a long time. And it\u2019s worth the investment. It is absolutely worth the investment we're putting in, in the next couple of years. Nate Brochmann : Great. Thanks. Mike Hansen : Okay. Operator : Thank you. We'll take the next question from Denny Galindo with Morgan Stanley. Denny Galindo : Hi there. Thanks for taking my call. Mike Hansen : Sure. Denny Galindo : I had a question on California market, little geographic question. Aramark said they were expanding capacity there and judging by your number of locations, I would guess maybe 7% of your rental revenue comes from California. Have you seen any impact, any competitive impact from Aramark's increased presence in California or are things pretty much business as usual over there? Mike Hansen : Denny, we haven\u2019t seen any marketable impact. Our West Coast locations are performing very, very well, and I would expect that they will continue to do so. And we haven\u2019t seen an impact. Denny Galindo : Is that about the right estimate of the size of California, somewhere around that 7% to 10% of revenue? Mike Hansen : I don\u2019t have \u2013 I honestly do not have that number in front of me, Denny. Denny Galindo : Okay. And then a little bit more color on the SAP question. Is the rollout and it sounds like it's location-by-location, is that evenly distributed throughout the year or is there any kind of seasonal impact to the enrollment? It sounds like it kinds of picks up maybe in the second half of this next fiscal year and does it mean it peaks in like Q1, Q2 and then tapers off after that? Mike Hansen : So as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're going to start the pilot sometime in the next three to four months. And that pilot is a very important part of our process. That pilot will make sure that the first several systems are operating the way we think they should operate, that the system performance is as we expect, et cetera. And so, the first half of fiscal '17 is really going to be working through the pilot to make sure that we've built a system, we've tested it, but its not \u2013 we've not gone live with it. That first part of fiscal '17 is really the first test on live customers, and we're going to make sure that, that goes right before we start rolling it out. So we'll start to see the implementation pick up in the second half of the year and it will continue all the way through fiscal '18. Denny Galindo : Okay. And how flexible are those cost numbers, if something like if the macro deteriorated, that you think you could reduce the impact from the SAP training by extending it out further or I imagine there is some kind of range of where you think the numbers will really shake out? Mike Hansen : Well, we - first of all, the longer the implementation takes, the more expensive it becomes, because we have more people tied up in that rollout process. So it does not benefit us to slow or stop that process once we get it started. We need to get it started when we expect to and we're going to see that move through the finish. But, Denny, if we saw a significant change in the economy, there are things that we can certainly do to help manage our cost structure and really continue to generate some pretty good cash flow, similar to the way we did in the last recession where we generated more cash than ever before in a two year period in the company's history. So we're going to get this thing done. I would certainly hope that we don\u2019t get into a recession in the next two years. But we're operating for the long-term, Denny. And we believe, as I said, this is a transformational system and it\u2019s going to be great for our customers and our partners who are operating the system. Denny Galindo : Okay. And one last one, just on the acquisition pipeline. I mean, with kind of energy almost bottoming here, are you seeing any small kind of regional players maybe in an energy heavy area that might be worth buying here or what does the acquisition pipeline look like more broadly? Mike Hansen : The acquisition pipeline still - I would say still looks pretty good. I mean, we've spent $150 million on acquisitions so far this fiscal year. We continue to look for tuck-in opportunities. We think they are out there. And we just need to have the willing seller at the right value. But we think there is a nice pipeline and we're going to continue to work that pipeline. So, yes, I do believe there are still opportunities out there. Denny Galindo : That's it for me. Thanks. Mike Hansen : Okay. Operator : We'll take our next question from Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sara Gubins : Hi, thank you. On the costs that you mentioned for next year, the $30 million to $35 million, is that all incremental spend? I mean, could you help us understand what it was or what you are expecting it to be in fiscal '16? Mike Hansen : So it is - I would say that it is mostly incremental spend, and in fiscal '16, we haven\u2019t spent much. There is some training, we are doing things like training the trainers. But there is not a lot of spend that's hitting the P&L this fiscal year. It will primarily start to happen once we get to the pilot stage and then ramp up once we get to the actual rollout. Sara Gubins : Okay. And you mentioned that we should also see D&A start to pick up. Could you give us some sense of how we should think about that in fiscal '17? Mike Hansen : I would say that, I'd rather give you a little bit more information on that in July, because while we've talked about the SAP capital project starting to depreciate, we've got other capital projects that are important to us, like making sure that we have the routes to continue to handle our growth and making sure that we've got capacity. So I think, Sara, I'd rather answer that question in July. Sara Gubins : Okay. And then just last question, could you give us an update on add-stops, what you are seeing including energy clients and excluding? Paul Adler : Sara, its Paul. The commentary is very similar to last quarter, meaning that really only two things were noteworthy. First is that in our add-stops metric we certainly see the negative impact to our FRC, our Flame Resistant Garments, as a result of the headcount reductions in oil, gas, and coal. Outside of that though there is nothing remarkable, nothing trending significantly one way or the other. And then the only other item of note would be that the winter weather here across the country was definitely a little more mild this year than last year. And we typically count on more of that snow and slush to drive mat placements and increase revenue accordingly, changes in garments, outerwear, et cetera. We didn\u2019t see it to the extent we did last year. But it wasn\u2019t significant and it's certainly a seasonal type of an impact. Sara Gubins : Thank you. Operator : We'll next go to Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird. Justin Hauke : Thank you; good evening, guys. I appreciate as well the SAP expense guidelines. I guess, maybe as an offset, a number that we hadn't really gotten is the integration costs associated with ZEE Medical and it was a sizable acquisition. I think the plan was that, that would be fully done by the end of the year, maybe just an update on that and if you could kind of quantify how much that expense has been? Mike Hansen : We have talked a little bit about getting that completed by the end of the year or shortly thereafter. And it\u2019s probably going to be shortly thereafter. That does not mean that we've seen any major slippage in the integration. It\u2019s just \u2013 it is a large implementation or integration for our business and we feel like it is going very well. We haven\u2019t gotten into a lot of specifics about the ZEE integration cost. Justin, with tuck-in acquisitions it becomes a little harder to fully separate total integration costs compared to operating costs. And so, we haven't tried to come to specific numbers on that - on what is specifically integration, because at the end of the day, we've got costs of operating and costs of connecting the businesses and we're hiring service sales reps, those are our drivers. We're hiring service sales reps and there are costs to getting a tuck-in acquisition ready. And so, we haven\u2019t called out anything specific. But I would suggest that probably in the fourth quarter we're going to see some results that are probably about the same, maybe slightly better than we've seen in the third quarter. And I would say that the first quarter, maybe even less so in terms of the mix impact. Justin Hauke : Okay. Yes, I appreciate that. I'm just trying to just understand how incremental the costs are and independent of the synergies if there was something that would come out. But it did sound like we'll get more of that in '17? I guess, maybe my second question is just the implied guidance for the fourth quarter, and I know this is a little short term oriented. But is the message that you are assuming in the way the guidance is laid out, is that assuming that your margins are relatively flat year-over-year with the fuel cost benefit moderating? And if that is the case, I guess, how should we think about it from the standpoint that the marketing expense falls off as well in the fourth quarter? Mike Hansen : Yes, I would say that the guidance suggests that we're kind of bracketing last year. Last year our fourth quarter we were at 15.6% operating margin and I would suggest that if we can reach the high end of that guidance, if things go well, I would expect some margin expansion. If we see a little bit of a pullback in the economy, if we see the oil and gas broaden to affect other verticals, we might be at the lower end and see flattish or slightly down. But I'd like to think that we're going to continue to operate in the existing type of economy and if we can hit the top end of the guidance, I would expect that to be some margin improvement. Justin Hauke : All right. Thank you very much. I appreciate the time. Operator : We'll next go to John Healy with Northcoast Research. John Healy : Thanks. Mike, I just wanted to follow up on that question on the margin outlook for 4Q. I was hoping you could size the SG&A benefit you get from having the 66 workdays versus the 65 and just try to put that in context, and what type of scenario would you have to see to see margins going to be anything but up in the fourth quarter? Mike Hansen : I think we've talked about a 50 - 40 basis point to 50 basis point impact in a quarter for the extra work day, and two thirds of that being in the gross margin. What would we have to see in order for margins to go down, I think we would have to see some pullback in the economy. I think we'd have to see some issues with our customer\u2019s willingness to continue to spend with us. But I would like to think that it is not all that likely. John Healy : Okay. That makes sense. And from a big picture standpoint, I was trying to think about your customer base in three buckets, your national accounts, your Costcos or Walmarts and General Motors of the world, and then your mid side regional accounts and then your small business customers. Could you talk to any sort of change in performance in terms of how each of those buckets maybe is performing? Is one of those groups kind of driving the lion's share of the growth in the company these days and has that contribution moved at all? Mike Hansen : I don't have any specific numbers. But I guess, John, I don\u2019t \u2013 I am not aware of any changes in those buckets. And in terms of the mix and performance, I am not aware of any changes. Our improvement, our growth continues to be fairly broad. And its - I think its broad in all of our businesses, which tells me that we're seeing good performance in almost every vertical and type of business with the exception of the ones that we called out. John Healy : Okay. That makes sense. And then one final clarification question. When you mentioned the $40 million to $45 million of spend on the SAP initiative in 2018, was that an incremental $40 million to $45 million on top of the $30 million to $35 million this year or is that an all-in spend number? Mike Hansen : John, the number was $45 million to $50 million for 2018 and that is an all-in spend. That is not incremental to the $30 million to $35 million for '17, so good question. John Healy : Thank you. Operator : We'll next go to Adrian Paz with Piper Jaffray. Adrian Paz : Hi. Quick question on the taxes. Can you provide more color on the lower taxes that we're seeing this quarter and do you believe that's going to continue into 2017? Mike Hansen : I do not. Typically we guide towards about a 37.3% all-in tax rate and when we have federal audits, they are fairly large projects and when they - if they are resolved favorably, like this one was, then there can be reserves that we have set up for tax positions that can be released. And that's what happened in this quarter. I think Paul mentioned our expected tax rate is 36.5% for this year, I would expect 37.3% next year. Adrian Paz : Great. Thanks. Thanks for the color there. And also I'm just trying to get a better understanding of what drove growth in uniform rentals. Could you provide some color on pricing trends that you're seeing in your uniform rentals? Mike Hansen : Sure. In the US, we really did not see much of a marketable change in pricing from the second quarter, still very competitive, but I wouldn\u2019t say that we saw much of a change. I would say that in Canada, little bit of a different story. We've seen some significant price increases from the competition. And I would suggest it looks likely that they may be looking for some margin opportunities. But I would say, back to the US, not a lot of change. Adrian Paz : All right. Great. Thank you so much. Operator : We'll now take a question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks and congratulations on the nice quarter, guys. I'm going to jump around a little bit. First one, anecdotally anything to share about the campaign, it\u2019s been asked already, it's a little early. But you touched on it a little bit, but any specific, without naming names, like anecdotes of where someone actually capitulated and added business from the national campaign? Thanks. Mike Hansen : I would say - I'm not sure about capitulated, but I would say we get \u2013 we have internal communications that will kind of bubble up comments from our sales people and they will be comments like, hey, I got a call today. A prospective customer heard our television ad and decided to call us and ask about our services. We might get, as an SSR stops by, a customer each week. We've gotten some examples of customers coming to our SSRs or our drivers, service sales reps. But we've got customers coming saying, wow, I love that commercial. Tell me more about first aid and safety. We've had examples where regional customers will come to one of our regional sales people and say, hey, I saw the commercial, digital commercial ad and it got me thinking about some of the issues that I have. And so we've seen it both from television, from radio, from digital; we've seen commentary from our salespeople that our customers are signaling out that they have seen the campaign, they like it; and it piques interest at times in some of the things that we can do for them. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks a lot. And then someone asked earlier about or you guys brought up from a question earlier the new product pipeline. You mentioned a lot of work on R&D, nothing to announce yet. But you've had obviously a lot of success, Carhartts, Calentel [ph] What - are we on the cusp of seeing something new from you, something big as far as another addition to product service? Mike Hansen : Scott, I would say that we still have a lot of runway in the products and services that we've announced. We do have some things that are in our pipeline that we're working on, but I am not ready to talk about any of them specifically. Scott Schneeberger : Fair enough. And lastly, you mentioned extending the footprint on the ERP [ph] for distribution, and particularly including e-commerce. I'm curious, could you elaborate on that, what you are looking to achieve there and what the opportunity is? Thanks. Mike Hansen : So from a distribution standpoint, that is primarily the distribution centers that ship to our rental locations. And so that is fairly obvious that gets them on the same platform and it makes a lot of sense. From an e-commerce standpoint, this system will allow us to share with our customers more information, to allow some of our customers an online buying experience similar to retail, and just allow much more ease-of-use from a selling and an understanding of what we do in the products and services. So it\u2019s really getting to a little bit more of a retail-like application for particularly our larger customers, but for all customers. Scott Schneeberger : Sounds good. All right; thanks very much. Mike Hansen : Okay. Operator : We'll take a question from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Gary Bisbee : Hey, guys, good afternoon. I obviously noted, as others have, your comments about the product portfolio and outgrowing GDP and all these things. I guess, a couple of questions on that from me. The first one just, is there anything that you think any reasons you would expect the business to behave differently in a future recession than it\u2019s done in the last couple? You clearly did not outgrow GDP in 2008, 2009 and the business contracted quite a bit, not only the top line, but also margins. I realize that was a pretty nasty recession. But anything that leads you to believe you'd behave differently if we had another very difficult economic environment? Mike Hansen : Yes, I think, first of all, Gary, you hit the nail on the head. That was the greatest recession we've seen in a long, long time. Unfortunately for us that interrupted 40 straight years of growth in sales and profit, so effectively for something like the last 46, 47 years we've grown in 45, 44 of them. So that was a big one. The next recession, a lot depends on how deep and broad it is. But I - one of the things, when we look at our business today compared to, let's call it, 2006, '07, '08, we've got a broader business. We've got a more diverse customer base. We were not much in the healthcare space back then. We were not much in financial services and other professional environments. We've been able to get into those much more with both rental, our rental products and services, but also first aid and fire protection. So we're in some verticals that might be a little less or more resistant, like healthcare to a recession. I think the other thing that I would say that\u2019s different is today our uniform, total uniform business is less than 50% of our revenue. And so, I think if we saw a pullback in jobs, I would not expect that we would lose many customers. But a lot of our products and services are still necessary for our customers, like hygiene products and services, like the fire protection services, like some of the first aid and safety requirements. And in addition to that, there are some required garments like fire resistant clothing. So I think the broadening of our product line, the diversity of our customers, will help us through the next recession. But again, a lot depends on how deep is that recession and how broad is it. Gary Bisbee : Great that's helpful. And then just a follow-up on that. You talk about having a broader product portfolio and I realize a lot of that is the growth of first aid, fire, and safety. But it\u2019s curious to me in that add-stops really haven't grown much. So it sounds like you haven't had a big part of your growth this up-cycle been driven by selling more stuff to the base. It's been more new customers, if I understand it. And then I go back to this number you give us on the fourth quarter every year and I'm awaiting next quarter of the mix within rentals and the mix of all the five or six different things you give us has been exactly the same percentages for four straight fiscal years. So I'm trying to really assess how much the composition of growth has really changed versus just executing well, bringing on similar types of new customers as you've always done in the past, any comments or thoughts on that? Thank you. Mike Hansen : Well, the - let's talk about the growth. First of all, new business has been very important to us over the last five or six years and will continue to always be important to us. New business, when we sell a new account, we do not normally sell everything in our portfolio to that new customer. We have to earn the customers trust and we have to show them that our service is of value. So new customers are really important for us. First of all, because they bring revenue but secondly, they bring future revenue opportunities, and so new business will always be very important to us. It is now and will continue to be. And then the penetration is very, very important. And I would tell you that the net add-stops metric, it\u2019s a legacy rental metric, and when we have broadened our business like we have, it really doesn\u2019t apply as much when we're talking about selling hygiene products and services to our customers, selling chemical cleaning solutions. That net add-stops really speaks to uniforms and mat placements. And we don\u2019t like to, we don\u2019t pay attention to it quite as much internally because it\u2019s just losing its importance as we broaden our business. So I would say, new business will continue to be important, penetration will continue to be important and the reason that you haven\u2019t seen any change in the mix of our rental division is because its all been growing and its really important for us that it all grows, because that means we are adding new customers and we are penetrating existing customers. It\u2019s all really important for us. Paul Adler : I think, Mike, too, and Gary, everything is growing. So the percentages are not changing significantly. But it's also an over $3 billion segment that's going to take some time to change. And one way it is changing, even though proportionally it\u2019s not changing. But for example, in garments, you manufacturing is a minority of the business and we are replacing the typical blue-on-blue shirt and pants with Carhartt or with performance polo\u2019s or cargo pants. And so in hygiene, for example, we have our hygiene standard [ph] signature line that is able to get us not just into the typical restrooms of manufacturing or oil change shops, but high end into offices and corporate complexes. And I think that changeover, even though proportionally it\u2019s not changing, but the kind of the substance of it, the quality of it, so to speak, should bode well and hopefully make us more resilient in the future. Gary Bisbee : Great. Thank you. Just one quick cleanup one. The incremental SAP expense you called out, is that in SG&A or would any of that be in cost of services and should we on a segment basis think it's all in rentals? Thanks a lot. Mike Hansen : I would expect that that will all fall into SG&A and the great majority of that will fall into rental. Gary Bisbee : Thank you. Mike Hansen : Okay. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Adler, Mr. Hansen, I'll turn the call back to you for any closing or additional remarks. Mike Hansen : Thank you very much for joining us tonight. We will issue our fourth quarter earnings in mid-July. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Good night. Operator : That concludes today's conference and thank you for your participation.",

This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We are pleased to report fourth quarter revenue of $1.271 billion, an increase of 11.3% from the prior year fourth quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and workday differences, was 6.7%. Fourth quarter operating income was $203 million, an increase of 14.2% over last year's fourth quarter. Operating margin improved to 16% of revenue, compared to an operating margin of 15.6% in the prior fiscal year. The Uniform Rental and Facilities Services segment led the way with an operating margin of 17.7%. Net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 was $118 million compared to $101 million in the prior year, an increase of 17.3%. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue improved to 9.3% from 8.8% of revenue in last fiscal year's fourth quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS, from continuing operations for the fourth quarter were $1.08 compared to $0.86 for the fourth quarter of last year. Fourth quarter EPS from continuing operations increased 25.6% compared to the prior year period. As our CEO Scott Farmer stated in today's earnings release, these achievements are the results of our employees, whom we call partners in being ready for our customers. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our partners for continuing to generate industry leading results. Our fourth quarter results were a strong finish to an excellent fiscal year, one in which we achieved record revenue and record EPS. We have a diverse customer base with about 70% of our revenue coming from customers and services providing areas of the economy. This has been made possible by our wide range of products and services. As a result of these and other assets, we have grown significantly in excess of US GDP and jobs each year since the Great Recession, and we are the clear leader in our industry, and in more ways than one, including size, growth rates, profit margins, quality, service and innovation. In addition to the success on the top line, we have delivered it on the bottom line. As Scott Farmer stated in today's press release, Cintas has increased EPS by double-digits in six consecutive years. Our research indicates that this feat has been accomplished by less than 5% of S&P 500 companies. Our cash flow and scale allow us to invest in numerous ways. In fiscal 2016, those investments included CapEx to both maintain and grow the business, and strategic investments, like our SAP project, and new Ready for the Workday branding campaign. We made acquisitions in our Rental, First Aid and Fire businesses and we have the capacity to do more. This past year, we paid our regular dividend and it was an increase of 23.5% over the prior-year's dividend. Since we went public in 1983, we've increased the annual dividend every year. Finally, in fiscal 2016, we repurchased shares under our buyback program at an aggregate cost of $759 million, including $276 million in our fourth quarter. Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, we expect revenue to be in the range of $5.150 billion to $5.225 billion, and EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.45. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the US economy or future share buybacks. It does include our expectations for our continued SAP system implementation, and the impact of one less workday in fiscal 2017, compared to 2016. We estimate that this one less workday will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points and operating income margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. I'll now turn the call over to Paul for additional information. Paul Adler : Thank you, Mike. First, please note that there were 66 workdays in this year's fourth quarter compared to only 65 in last year's fourth quarter. We estimate that this additional day benefited the quarter's operating income margin by 40 to 50 basis points. As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.7% in the fourth quarter. This solid growth rate was driven largely by new business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services, and strong customer retention. About 60% of new business wins continue to come from no-programmers, or customers that have never had a rental program. We are providing no-programmers in healthcare with scrub rental, those in construction and trades with Carhartt-branded workwear, and no-programmers and customer-facing positions like retail, theme parks and transportation, with performance polos and cargo pants. Our broad range of innovative and proprietary products and services enable us to do more for the customer, including uniform and mat rental, hygiene, first aid supplies, CPR and other training, and fire extinguisher testing and recharging, to name a few. And the more we do for the customer, the more they appreciate our quality and service, and the less likely they are to leave us. Total company gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter of this year, compared to 42.6% last year. Total company energy-related expenses, including gas, diesel and natural gas for this year's fourth quarter were 1.8% of revenue, about 40 basis points lower than last year's fourth quarter. Note, however, that we continued to see the impact of headcount reductions in the oil, gas and coal industries. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from customers in these industries lowered our organic growth rate by about 100 basis points in the fourth quarter and reduced our operating margin by about 50 basis points. So, the low fuel prices were not enough to offset the negative impact from our energy customers, and the net impact from energy was a headwind of about 10 basis points. We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services, and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment included the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $965 million, an increase of 8.3% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, workday differences and acquisitions, organic growth was 6.3%. At this time of the year, we provide revenue mix for this segment. Due to the fact that we changed our segments this fiscal year, I will provide the prior year data for comparability. The revenue mix for the segment for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and 2015 was as follows. Uniform Rental accounted for approximately 50% of total revenue compared to 51% last year. Dust Control, comprised mainly of entrance mats, accounted for 18% in both years. Hygiene and Other Services, including Restroom Supply, Cleaning Services and Chemical Services, was 14% of total revenue versus 13% last year. Shop towels were unchanged from prior year at 5% of revenue. Linen and Other, which is mainly non-person-specific garments such as aprons and butcher coats was 9% compared to 8% last year, and Catalog Sales were 4% this year versus 5% last year. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.3% for the fourth quarter, an increase of 150 basis points from 42.8% in last year's fourth quarter. We estimate that the extra workday in this year's fourth quarter compared to last year benefited operating margin about 40 to 50 basis points, the majority of which falls within gross margin. Energy related costs were 50 basis points lower than in last year's fourth quarter. However, job losses in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year fourth-quarter operating margin by about 50 basis points. So, on a net basis, the low fuel prices did not benefit our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin because they were offset by the headcount reductions impacting our oil, gas and coal customers. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of First Aid products, Safety Products, and Training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $123 million, which was 45% higher than last year's fourth quarter. Total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. On an organic basis, growth for this segment was 6.9%. This segment's gross margin was 42.9% in the fourth quarter compared to 46.8% in the prior year period. Operating income margin was 10.9% compared to 15.2% in last year's fourth quarter. We did see a 30 basis point sequential improvement in operating margin. The reduction in First Aid organic growth rate and margins is wholly attributable to the impact of the acquired ZEE Medical business. Recall that ZEE was about one-third the size of our existing First Aid business, a significant acquisition to this operating segment. We continue to incur the typical conversion costs, which impact margin from the short term. The assimilation of the business, including route consolidation, is still in process, as expected. In fact, the fourth quarter saw the largest number of ZEE locations being integrated. All of these efforts have a short term impact to growth rates and margins, as is common in an acquisition of this relative magnitude. The completion of the integration will be followed by the realization in full of the synergies. We are on track and continue to be pleased with this acquisition. Regarding selling, and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 27.6% as a percentage of fourth quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's fourth quarter of 27.0%. Medical expenses as a percentage of revenue were 20 basis points higher in this year's fourth quarter. Also note that our new national branding campaign impacted SG&A by about 35 basis points. On June 1st, $250 million of debt, with a coupon of 2.85%, matured. We refinanced this debt in the form of commercial paper. By staying short in commercial paper, paying about 70 basis points, we were able to reduce interest expense in fiscal 2017 by about $5 million, and avoid a headwind that would result from financing with long-term debt. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter was 37.1% compared to 37.7% for last year's fourth quarter. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 to be about 36.7%. That's up slightly from fiscal 2016's 36.4%. Our cash and marketable securities were $210 million as of May 31st, a decrease of $177 million from the balances of February 29th. Uses of cash in the quarter included $278 million for repurchases of Cintas common stock and $57 million to pay some of the taxes due on the gains related to the sale of our Shred-it investment. Regarding the sale of the Shred-it investment, please note that the impacts are accounted for throughout the cash flow statement. The proceeds from the sale of $581 million are recorded as cash provided by investing activities, while the taxes paid on the gain from the sale are recorded as cash used in operating activities. This accounting, while proper per Generally Accepted Accounting Principles has the effect of understating cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow if one does not remember that the taxes paid relate to a non-recurring transaction in which the benefits in the form of cash proceeds are recorded in another section of the cash flow statement. So if we eliminate the impact of the sale of the Shred-it investment from the cash flow statement, cash flow provided by operating activities would be $695 million for fiscal 2016 versus $580 million the prior year, an increase of 19.8%. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were about $68 million. Our CapEx by reportable operating segment was as follows, $56 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $9 million in First Aid and Safety, and $3 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $280 million to $320 million. This range includes about $40 million of CapEx related to our SAP implementation. Regarding SAP, as we disclosed last quarter, we expect to begin depreciating the project around December 2016. Our fiscal year 2017 will include about a half a year of depreciation. It will also include about half a year of system maintenance costs. The conversion of our hundreds of operations to SAP will occur during fiscal 2017 and extend through fiscal 2018. Training costs, which are expensed when incurred as opposed to amortized over time, will exist in both fiscal 2017 and 2018. As is customary in such a conversion, we expect to have other additional costs in 2017 and 2018 as a result of inefficiencies until the old system is completely off-line. We estimate that the investment in SAP will result in $30 million to $35 million of expense in fiscal 2017 and $45 million to $50 million of expense in fiscal 2018. The estimated fiscal 2017 expenses are included in our 2017 guidance. We will begin to receive some cost structure benefits in fiscal 2019, but will likely see the power of the system beginning in fiscal 2020 once all operations have had some experience in running it. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is actually Greg calling on for Manav. First off, I was just hoping you could help us bridge to your 2017 revenues between what you would consider organic growth and the FX or M&A impact? And then maybe more specifically, you can talk about how you're thinking about organic growth in 2017 and how it compares to the - I guess, nearly 7% you delivered in 2016? Mike Hansen : Greg, we don't typically give organic growth because lots of things can happen throughout the year. But I - you can probably see from our guidance where the revenue range is 5% to 6.5%. That's pretty much in line with what we gave in terms of initial guidance last year. Keep in mind that, as I mentioned, we'll get a negative impact of 40 to 50 basis points because of the one less workday. And so I would say that we're not expecting too many changes this year, but we don't give specific organic growth numbers. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Fair enough. And then maybe on the energy side, it sounded like the negative net add stops were a little worse than you had expected in the fourth quarter. Maybe you can talk about the moving pieces and how you're thinking about that in 2017 between cost saves and potential further pressure, if we are in a lower for longer oil environment? Paul Adler : Yes, Greg, it's Paul. Add stops were - they were negative this quarter, but they typically are. There are some seasonal impacts that impact us in the fourth quarter. For example, we have jackets coming off from the winter and being returned to the stock rooms. We have mats that are extra mats that some of the customers were snow and slush, and those are returned as well. So typically, add stops are negative in the fourth quarter, and they are for us this fourth quarter. And then to your point, they are a little more so than typical, because we still are feeling the effects of headcount reductions in our energy customers. In terms of next fiscal year, we can tell you that we still expect to have some headwinds from oil, gas and coal customers. We would expect the headwind to revenue in fiscal '17 to be about 60 basis points, and that's built into our guidance. So that's the top-line impact. On the bottom line, we would expect that to be a headwind then of about 30 basis points of operating margin. The other impact that we believe we will have is just in the fuel costs. Whereas we had a benefit in fiscal '16, we're modeling that the fuel will be a headwind to our cost structure to maybe about 30 basis points. Unidentified Analyst : A headwind to - on the cost side, higher fuel costs? Paul Adler : Yes. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Paul Adler : On fiscal '16, on a net benefit - or a net basis rather, in fiscal '16, considering the benefit of fuel and the cost structure and then the negative impact of the headcount reductions, reducing revenue and operating margin, we had like a 10 basis point improvement for fiscal '16. Whereas in fiscal '17, we are expecting it to be more of a 60 basis points headwind. So quite a significant change. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Gary Bisbee : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Mike Hansen : Hi, Gary. Gary Bisbee : I thought it was an interesting statistic you gave, if I heard it right, that 70% of your revenue you think is from services industry end markets or customers. And can you just help us frame that, I mean, how - what would that have looked like five years ago? Has that been a pretty substantial shift over time or has it been more moderate? Mike Hansen : I would say in the last five years, probably not too substantial. But over the last, let's call it 15 years, probably much more - and probably even more inverse of that. You know, as jobs over the last couple decades have been off-shored, we have certainly been forced to look for other ways of creating revenue in terms of the uniforms, and that, we've been very successful in the service providing areas. And so, I would say it's different from certainly 15 years ago. It's probably not too different from five years ago. But I would say that it continues - we continue to perform well in those areas. A couple of the different pieces that we would see as better today than maybe five years ago even, and certainly 15, would be healthcare, which, 15 years ago, we probably had a very, very small presence and food service. And in both of those, we've been able to come up with creative solutions, innovative solutions, to get more of an impact in those verticals, and that certainly has helped us. Gary Bisbee : And when we think about that, is that both a uniform rental story, and then also just penetration of a lot of the other stuff that has broader appeal or is it more the latter than the former? Mike Hansen : No, that's all of our businesses. And when you think about the Rental segment by itself, there's not a lot of difference in terms of the vertical splits between Uniform Rental and Facility Services. We are providing many of those products to the same customers, and so not a lot of difference there. Gary Bisbee : Okay. Great. And then if I could just ask one more. Can you give us any more color on how the branding campaign is working? I think we saw - we are seeing commercials, and seen them on the Internet and a few other things. But what has that done? Is that just awareness or are you actually seeing this help you closing the business? Thank you. Mike Hansen : Well, the branding campaign has continued, and we certainly - our Cintas partners, our employees are very energized and excited about it. And so it's had a positive impact on us certainly from an energy and excited standpoint. But we're too early to begin to measure the impact of it. I think I mentioned last quarter that it would probably be more like the second half of fiscal '17 before we would start to really be able to measure any kind of impact. Keeping in mind, it is a brand awareness campaign. So it is trying to make sure that our customers and our prospects understand and know all of the different things that we can provide to them, all of the different products and services. And we are not specifically targeting any one of them right now. So, again, we're excited about it. It's going well. It's been - the feedback that we get anecdotally has been very good. But I don't expect to be able to give any measurements on it until the back half of fiscal '17. Gary Bisbee : Sounds good. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Nate Brochmann : Hi. Good evening, gentlemen. Mike Hansen : Hi, Nate. Paul Adler : Hi, Nate. Nate Brochmann : So just playing off of Gary's question there a little bit, and I think that's one thing that you guys have really done a great job of in terms of maintaining the sales momentum in somewhat of an underlying sluggish job growth environment. Could you talk a little bit about, as you go back 15 years ago till today, in terms of being able to change the customer buying behavior to kind of except maybe those new rental uniforms that you have going into those newer industries for you? And then, second, how much longer is that tail in terms of opportunity, given the fact that it's been only in the last, you know, call it, five or seven years that we've really made some real inroads there? Mike Hansen : Well, I think the - from a customer perspective, I think it begins with innovative products. We can't get service industries to just simply change with what we might call legacy uniform rental workwear. We have to be innovative, and we have to create uniform solutions that our customers want to wear. And we think we've been pretty successful in doing that. Paul gave a couple of examples in his narrative a few minutes ago. And so it really starts with innovative products and solutions. And we feel like that's - we've been pretty good at that. That's going to be important to continue to do that as we move forward. As far as how much opportunity is still out there, we feel like there is quite a bit of opportunity. We continue to introduce new products like our Carhartt, like our scrub rental, like our Chef Works products for rental. And it takes a while to get those fully penetrated and fully rolled out. And so there's a lot of runway in just our existing products, and that doesn't include any products that we will continue to invest in and look for. Nate Brochmann : And I would assume along with that, though, like the word of mouth in terms of people within the industry even talking, that's got to kind of help accelerate that runway a little bit, right? Mike Hansen : Well, I would say that the more prospecting we do, and the more that we talk about our solutions, yes, the better that can become. And that - from a word of mouth standpoint, that gets around to different decision makers. Nate Brochmann : Okay. And then second question is, kind of when you originally announced some of the upfront cost-related SAP, I think there might've been a little bit of initial worry about what we can do to offset that. I mean, clearly, with your guidance going into next year, that's pretty strong. I would assume that you have uncovered some offsets to kind of help balance some of those costs, and obviously, you're really great in terms of the gross margin expansion as well. Could you talk about maybe some of those things underneath the covers that you are able to find to offset that, particularly given some of the headwinds you're facing in terms of the lost day and the energy costs, et cetera? Mike Hansen : Sure. I would say, Nate, that it's not that we've uncovered a lot of different things; it's just that - I'll go through a couple things. We won't have the incremental IT investments that we would typically have, and that's helpful. We expect certainly improved performance out of our First Aid and Safety business, as we lap the acquisition of ZEE. Again, we expect to see improved performance certainly, and we expect to see improved performance out of our Fire business. Those certainly will help. And you are seeing that as part of the guidance. We will certainly get some natural leverage from the growth in our Rental segment and that will help. And then we're also continuing to control our costs and manage our cost structure, and we've been pretty successful at that and we'll continue to be successful at that. So there are a number of different things that go into this and help offset some of the headwinds that we've talked about. But I think - there's nothing - there's no magic silver bullet that we've got that we've all of a sudden uncovered. It's continuing to do what we do. Nate Brochmann : Great. Thanks for all the extra color. I appreciate it. Mike Hansen : Okay. Operator : We'll take our next question from Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sara Gubins : Hi, thanks. Just a follow-up on that - at the end of your last comments you said that you're -- overall, you're focused on managing the cost structure. Could you add in a little more detail about where - aside from natural leverage in the business, you are able to do that? Mike Hansen : Well, aside from investments that we choose to make, our expectation is that we're going to grow our G&A about half as much as revenue each year, and we've been pretty good at that. Again, aside from certain investments that we want to make. And so a lot of it comes from managing that G&A structure. A lot of it comes from an active Six Sigma program where we are constantly looking for small incremental wins to medium size wins. And those Six Sigma process improvements come in our production, in our plants, they come on our routes, they come in all different places. We have a lot of people who are involved in that Six Sigma program looking for small to medium size wins. And that will certainly help as we become more and more efficient in all of our processes. Sara Gubins : Okay. Thank you. And could you give us an update on the pricing environment? Have you seen any changes there? Paul Adler : Sara, its Paul. Yes, on the pricing front, we haven't really seen anything in terms of a marketable change. So it's been pretty status quo. It's still competitive in terms of national account programs, but that hasn't changed, and really no difference. So nothing, no worthy or anything significant to pass on to you there. Sara Gubins : Okay. Great. And then just last question, could you talk about your priorities for capital next year? Mike Hansen : Well, I - Sara, I would say that those priorities will be the same as they have been for fiscal '16. I talked a little bit about that in our prepared remarks. We're going to continue to invest in the business. We're going to continue to do that through a little bit of the P&L, but also through CapEx. We are certainly going to be looking for acquisition opportunities that create long-term value for us similar to the way we did that in fiscal '16. Our third priority is we will take a look at the dividend, and if history repeats, we will likely increase the dividend this year, because that has been very important to us. And then lastly, if there are - if there is cash remaining, we certainly will put it to work in share buybacks. But we will look at it in that priority order and making sure that we are always looking to strengthen Cintas for the long-term. Sara Gubins : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jeff Goldstein with Morgan Stanley. Jeff Goldstein : Hi. I wanted to ask about the All Other segment, where it looks like you had some strong growth in the quarter. First of all, are you able to provide the organic growth for that segment? And then secondly, was growth there driven by any large one-off orders in direct sales or was it more broad-based in nature? Paul Adler : Yes. I can provide you with the organic growth of All Other, it was 8.5% in the quarter. And that All Other, just as a reminder, includes our Fire business and our Direct Sale business. And that Direct Sale business is typically more of a slower grower in our portfolio, but it had a good quarter. It was a little stronger growth rate. And again, that's direct sale business, can be a little more volatile, so we had some good rollouts of programs in the fourth quarter that helped push growth along and get that organic growth rate up pretty nicely. The Fire business continues to grow nicely as well. We expect about double-digit growth in our Fire business. And so as a result of growing the top line in both of those businesses, we also saw 100 basis points of operating margin expansion in that segment as well. Jeff Goldstein : Okay. And then I want to ask about cotton prices, which have actually increased pretty significantly recently. Would you expect any type of headwind to your business if we are able to see kind of more of a sustained period of these higher cotton prices? Mike Hansen : Well, cotton, we would have to see a sustained increase in cotton, and for a while. So let's talk about specifically for our Rental business, you know, when we think about most of our uniforms, they are a polycotton blend or lower percentage of cotton. So that is - that's point number one. Secondly, labor is the biggest component of cost out of our garments, and so the materials are not the majority of the cost involved. Thirdly, there's a supply chain. And so we would have to order the fabric. It would be sown into garments, that - and then shipped to our distribution center. That probably takes somewhere of 8 to 10 weeks. Then there is a turn through the distribution center, and then it gets shipped out our rental locations where it gets generally amortized over some period of time, mostly 18 months. So there is a quite a bit of time before we would see a sustained cotton impact. And even if we did see a sustained cotton impact, because of the percentage of the cost itself, I don't see that - I just don't expect that that would be that noticeable, and it would have to be a real spike for some sustained period of time. Jeff Goldstein : Okay. That's helpful. And then I just have one last maintenance question. You had said regarding the national advertising campaign that spending on the campaign would likely ramp up again in fiscal '17. Is that still the guidance, and do you have any color on which quarters would likely see most of that spend? Mike Hansen : It - we expect that our spend will be about the same in fiscal '17 as fiscal '16, which for the year, is about 25 basis points. I would expect that the largest or the impacts would be the greatest in our second and third quarters. Jeff Goldstein : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Andrew Wittmann with R.W. Baird. Andrew Wittmann : Great. So, Mike, thanks for the answer previously about some of the offsets that you had to the margins. Given that those headwinds are pretty significant, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail? And in the past, you mentioned that the ZEE integrations that you thought that the segment margins could get back up to their pre-ZEE levels, which I guess is - I don't know, 13-ish-percent for the segment? Is that still the right goal, and what's the timeframe to which you think you can get those ZEE margins? Or to get these significant offsets, are you now eyeing above prior segment margin peaks? Paul Adler : Andy, its Paul. Yes, as far as ZEE is concerned, I just want to reiterate that we are pleased with that acquisition; everything is on track. We had mentioned previously that we need a full year to get through the integration. And so through May, we're about 75% of the way through. It's not turnkey, it's not standalone, as you know; it's largely a tuck-in. And so when you have a tuck-in, you have a little short-term efforts in order to get those synergies in the long-term. And that's definitely what we are seeing in the First Aid segment is that impact, the integration costs, re-routing, goodwill and customers to make sure nothing falls through in the transition. You can't run as fast as you would like to right out of the gate. But things are on track. We do expect those margins to bounce back. We don't have a timeframe as far as here's the timetable and the quarters and the milestones. But absolutely, we have another quarter of integration in fiscal '17, and we expect to see those margins bounce back. And baked into our guidance for fiscal '17 is improvements in those First Aid and Safety margins, and some stronger growth rates than you saw in the fourth quarter as well. Mike Hansen : And Andy, I would add to that, from a Fire Protection Services perspective, we continue to grow that business. And we grow it - we've grown it quite nicely in the last year, Paul talked about it growing nicely in the fourth quarter. And we expect continued operating margin improvement in that business as well, as we gain density in a lot of our different markets. And as that business continues to do the same thing that our other businesses do, and that is fine product adjacencies, continue to penetrate existing customers, while adding new storefronts. Our National Account Fire business has been very good over the last year as well. And so there, we expect certainly improvements in the First Aid business, as Paul talked about, but we also expect them in our Fire Protection business, and that certainly will help us in fiscal '17. Andrew Wittmann : Okay. Thank you for that context. On the capital budget, I think I heard 280 to 320, that compares to $275 ish this year. I'm just curious as - and we know we - I think we had decent SAP spending in fiscal '16. I think I heard you say that there's 40 expected in fiscal '17, but I still think that's a pretty decent increase and I was wondering what you contribute the delta to? Mike Hansen : Well, we will be adding capacity like we've talked about. I believe we'll have a couple different facilities open here early in this fiscal year. Those were not full newbuilds, but they were capacity increases. And that will give us some help in the first quarter. And then we expect to continue to increase capacity because of our growth, probably closer to the end of the fiscal year or into early fiscal '18. So there's a little bit more capacity spend than we've seen over the last - certainly over the last three to five years, and even a little bit more than we have seen in fiscal '16. Andrew Wittmann : Okay. Last question, it's been reported that you guys are going to - and you've had the, I think, the Southwest Airlines contract for a while, which, correct me if I'm wrong, it was mostly a direct sale. Last time you guys redressed an airline was I think it was United Airlines, and that was a tangible number that we could see to the P&L. Is the Southwest Airlines on the same order of magnitude in terms of the contribution? And how should we expect the timing of that to flow through? And maybe any comments you would have on the profitability, is that rollout a major program, I think would be fairly short order. Mike Hansen : That is a - that's a great success for us in terms of gaining the award for that business. That's - of the impactful piece of that is relatively new. It's early, so I'm not ready to provide any timetable and estimates. But we'll certainly talk more about that as we go through the performance of that business. But we're early on. Again, we've got to source the product, and that takes some time. And so those big projects don't happen overnight. And in fact, I think we started working on the United program something like 12 to 15 months in advance of starting to ship. So it is a nice program for us, but it's going to take a little time. Andrew Wittmann : Okay. So the implication there is if United was 12-plus months, this one might not even have a lot of revenue contribution this year, is that fair to say? Mike Hansen : I think that's a fair assumption. Andrew Wittmann : Okay. Great. That's it for me. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Joe Box with KeyBanc. Joe Box : Hey. Good evening, guys. Mike Hansen : Hi, Joe. Paul Adler : Hi, Joe. Joe Box : So a couple of questions around the Uniform segment organic growth rate. One, is the growth rate for Uniform versus All Other kind of categories within that Uniform segment, are you still seeing the growth rates kind of trend at a similar rate or are you starting to see them diverge? And two, if I heard you right, it sounded like you highlighted new business wins, better penetration and even retention as kind of the biggest drivers to the entire segment. I'm curious if any of those three things are either accelerating or decelerating? Mike Hansen : Well, I would say that the fiscal '16, as we've talked a lot about, had an impact on - from our oil, gas and mining customers throughout the year. And that has had a bit of a negative impact on the growth of the Uniform side relative to the whole segment. So it is a little bit - the Uniform Rental side is a little bit lower in terms of the growth than the average. And we've been able to pick that up through the Facility Services, both in new business and in the penetration, and as Paul said, the retention. I would say that from the standpoint of do any one of those three stick out dramatically, I would say no. But I would say that the penetration, we have lots of opportunity left. There is a lot of runway to continue to add value to our existing customers. And we've been very successful at that in fiscal '16, particularly with some of our hygiene products and services like our Signature series, kind of a more front-of-the-house hygiene business. And I think what I am describing kind of shows itself in the numbers that Paul gave, and that is that the Uniform Rental business was 51% of that revenue last year, it's now 50%. The hygiene was 13% last year; it's now 14%. That's what you are seeing. You are seeing some lost oil, gas and mining customers, but it's being offset by some nice penetration and improvements in retention. Joe Box : Right. Appreciate that. And then maybe switching gears to the SAP side, I know obviously it's very early on the Uniform Rental side. But can you maybe just talk about the number of branches that you've rolled out maybe through mid-July, and some early impressions or challenges that you might have had with that? Mike Hansen : Well, we just recently started our pilot, and early indications are that we're off to a very good start. However, we're early. I think I talked about this last quarter. Our pilot is effectively starting with one location and really learning a lot. And assuming that goes well, we will move to several others. So that by mid-fiscal year, our expectation would be that we're kind of ready to start rolling out full speed. So right now, we're in that early pilot stage with one location. And, like I said, early indications are it's going pretty well. But again, we're early. And I think we'll have more to say about that more than likely at the end of our first and second quarters. Joe Box : Got it. And maybe I guess in that same vein, clearly, SAP is going to be a big project for you guys over the next couple of years. Your balance sheet is generally under levered. I'm curious if you guys would be willing to do a sizable deal throughout this SAP process or would you pretty much table any sort of major deal until SAP was completely rolled out? Mike Hansen : Well, I would tell you that this SAP is a big project, and we've got a lot of resources and attention put to that. But you know, opportunities don't come along every day. And if we had an opportunity, small or large, to add value for the long-term benefits at Cintas, we certainly would take a look at it. And again, at the right value, we would certainly love to do M&A that provides long-term value. That is the same message that we've had for quite a while and that doesn't change during the SAP rollout. It certainly may affect the way we would integrate it. But if we have opportunities that create great value for Cintas, we'll still take a good look at them. Joe Box : Got it. Thank you, guys. Operator : We'll take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. From the press release, we know that - and typically, you guys anticipate a fairly flat economy in the forward guidance. Could you speak to how you think about employment, maybe with regard to oil and gas and mining, and then x-ing that out, how you think about it? Thanks. Mike Hansen : Well, we - from an oil, gas and mining standpoint, we have seen continued deterioration. But I would say today, that rate of deterioration is slowing, certainly relative to 90 days ago. But as Paul mentioned, we still expect to see a negative 60 basis points to the top line. So that tells you that we don't - we won't feel healed in that area in fiscal '17. From the rest of the - let's call it economic picture, I would say that it's still a challenging environment. There's not a lot of momentum to it. But I would call it stable. We haven't seen a lot of change today compared to a quarter ago. And so, I would say we're continuing to operate like we have been. I would say as we look into fiscal 2017, if I were to make a comment about the economy that maybe did feel a little bit different, I would say today compared to, let's call it six months ago, it does feel like there is a bit more uncertainty. When you think about the - we do - we have seen some ups and downs in employment; no doubt about that. We've seen the European issues; we've seen changes from the Department of Labor in terms of minimum wage and overtime that can have a pausing effect on our customers  We've got the election coming up. It does feel like there is a little bit more uncertainty than there was six months ago. And that's likely bleeding into the bottom end of our guidance range. Scott Schneeberger : All right, thanks. That's helpful. And then you talked kind of piecemeal as we've gone through Q&A with regard to, say, branding and what quarters that may hit more. Could you speak to - I don't know if you mentioned the quarter with the extra or the one less day, but on a quarterly basis, top to bottom, when might we expect some of the ebbs and flows? I guess I'm thinking more on expense and how it will impact the margin. But just how we move through the year, is there anything worth pointing out that will be a big factor, just on the sequential basis as we move through the year? Thanks. Mike Hansen : Sure. I would say a couple things, Scott. Paul talked about a tax rate of 36.7%. That's a little bit higher than last year, but lower than our - maybe our longer-term. I would expect that we are going to see a slightly lower tax rate in the first quarter, followed by something closer to what we've typically guided toward in that 37% range in the last three quarters. So that's maybe one point. From a Ready for the Workday campaign standpoint, I would say that it is going to - the bulk of it is going to be in the second and third quarters. From an SAP standpoint, we talked earlier about that will be back-end loaded. So we will have some costs in the first half of the year, but we turn on the depreciation and we turn on the licensing expenses in the second half of the year. So we will see a little bit more pressure in that back half from that standpoint. As far as calling things out, I think maybe the other thing that I might call out is the first quarter, as Paul mentioned, would have a little bit heavier, from a First Aid standpoint, ZEE implementation and integration costs. But from a quarter-to-quarter basis, I don't know that I would have much more to share than that. Paul Adler : Yes, I can't recall, Scott, if we mentioned the third quarter is the quarter with the one less workday. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. I think you did last time; I just didn't have it in front. So thanks for repeating it, guys. And that color was very helpful. Appreciate it. Mike Hansen : Sure. Operator : We'll take our next question from Adrian Paz with Piper Jaffray. Mr. Paz, your line is open. You may want to \u2013 did you press your mute function. Adrian Paz : Hi, this is Adrian Paz on for George Tong. I just wanted to get a little more code on M&A. I know for a long time, Cintas didn't do any acquisitions. And in recent quarters, we've seen a pretty big - well, yes, in recent quarters, we've seen a pretty big uptick in acquisition activity. I mean, is - are you seeing better valuations out there? And is there any segment that you're targeting growth in through M&A? Mike Hansen : Well, we - I would say that, as far as M&A goes, it really is opportunistic. So when the opportunities become available, we need to be ready to take advantage of those, and we were opportunistic in fiscal '16, certainly. We would look for acquisitions in our Rental business, in our First Aid and Safety business, in our Fire businesses primarily. We love tuck-in acquisitions. They are very accretive. And we'll continue to look aggressively for those kind of opportunities, provided they are at the right value. We might look for bigger opportunities in any of those businesses, again, as long as they provide long-term value for us, and at the right valuation. Adrian Paz : Also, can you provide an update on Canadian operations? I know that they had been experiencing some headwinds a few quarters back with the currency. Have those - I guess operations there stabilized, and are they, I guess, resuming growth? Mike Hansen : Well, I would say that the performance of the business there hasn't necessarily been affected by the currency exchange rate. Our business continues to perform well. But we have seen less volatility in that Canadian exchange rate. I think the negative impact to the top line was 30 basis points. So we're still seeing a little bit of negative. But generally speaking, the business continues to perform well. Adrian Paz : All right, thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman : Hi. Could you just tell us what share count we should use for the first quarter based on the share buyback that was done already? And does your guidance assume any further share buyback? Paul Adler : Andrew, its Paul. The guidance does not assume any further share buyback. Maybe just to sync up, I don't know if you noticed, but with the earnings release, we have income statement that we enclosed, and there's a supplemental schedule in there that has the computation of diluted EPS. And if you look at that for the 12 months ended May 31st of 2016, you'll see our computation there for the current year where we start off with income from continuing ops; we reduce it. And it's about 1.6% reduction to allocate income to its participating securities. And then we divided that number by 110 million diluted shares outstanding. And so in fiscal '17 for our modeling, we are going to use about that same $110 million or not million dollars, 110 million shares, rather for computation of fiscal '17 EPS. Andrew Steinerman : Perfect. Paul Adler : So model your '17 number, reduce it for the income to the participating securities, and look at 110 million shares. Andrew Steinerman : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our final question from Dan Dolev with Nomura. Dan Dolev : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I know you don't guide to margin growth, but if I think through the $30 million to $35 million of incremental SAP expense, and I think about what the implied operating margin growth is this year, say, at the midpoint maybe down 40 basis points, if I add back the SAP, I'm looking at maybe 20-ish. That's still a step-down from what you did last year, even at the midpoint. Is that just conservatism or could you maybe help me bridge through how should we think about that? Thanks. Mike Hansen : Well, our total incremental margins for fiscal '16 for the company was - were about 20%. Rental, it was certainly higher. Rental was more like 28%. We have talked about, historically, that that incremental margin, we want that incremental margin to be in the 20% to 30% range. If we're higher than that for sustained periods of time, we worry that we're not investing enough. And I would tell you that, as we look into '17, excluding the SAP impact, we're about in that same range; maybe a little bit on the lower side because of the negative oil and gas impact, because of the negative workday impact. But generally speaking, we think there are good incremental margins. And at the top end of the guidance, even with the SAP impact, even with the oil and gas, even with the extra workday, there is a slight operating margin improvement. Dan Dolev : Got it. And I remember last time you said you won't be sitting idly watching the $30 million to $35 million flow down to the bottom line. How do you feel about those today, four months later? Mike Hansen : Well, I would like to think that the guidance that we have provided is an indication that that's exactly what we have done. And that is not sit around idly waiting for $30 million to $35 million to hit. But instead, we are continuing to run the business, execute very, very well, improve where we can, and come up with very good results. And we feel good about the business. I think that guidance would tell you that we feel good going into fiscal '17, and our partners still are executing at very, very high levels. Dan Dolev : Excellent. Thank you very much. Mike Hansen : You're welcome. Operator : That will conclude the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn it back to today's speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Mike Hansen : Well, thank you for joining us tonight. We will issue our first quarter earnings in the end of September, and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Hansen : Thank you for joining us. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2017. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We are pleased to report first quarter revenue of $1.294 billion, an increase of 7.9% from the prior year first quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 5.7%. First quarter operating income was $207 million, an increase of 11.6% over last year's first quarter. Operating margin improved to 16% of revenue, compared to an operating margin of 15.5% in the prior fiscal year. The Uniform Rental and Facilities Services segment led the way with an operating margin of 18.5%, a 90 basis point expansion from the prior year.  Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $138 million compared to $106 million in the prior year, an increase of 30%. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue was 10.7% compared to 8.9% of revenue in last fiscal year's first quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS, from continuing operations for the first quarter were $1.26 versus to $0.93 for the first quarter of last year. First quarter EPS from continuing operations increased 35.5% over the prior year. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 entitled Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting was adopted. Under ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits and deficiencies associated with employee share-based payments are no longer recognized as additional paid-in capital on the balance sheet but instead recognized directly to income tax expense or benefit in the income statement in the reporting period in which they occur. Other financial statement items impacted include share-based compensation expense and the computation of fully diluted shares outstanding. The first quarter of fiscal 2017 net benefit to EPS from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 was $0.14, consisting of a reduction of income tax expense of $0.16 partially offset by a $0.01 negative impact from additional employee share-based compensation expense reducing operating income and a $0.01 negative impact from an increase in the number of diluted shares outstanding.  Also note that our first quarter of fiscal 2017 operating income includes almost $3 million of transaction expenses related to our recently announced agreement to acquire G&K Services. The impact of adopting ASU 2016-09 and the G&K transaction expenses make year-over-year comparison somewhat challenging. So I want to provide some figures to help you better understand first quarter performance. Excluding these impacts, operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was 16.3%, an increase of 80 basis points from the prior year period. Net income from continuing operations was $125 million and EPS was $1.14. The increase in net income and EPS over prior year periods excluding the impacts of ASU 2016-09 and G&K transaction costs was 17.7% and 22.6% respectively.  As our CEO Scott Farmer stated in today's earnings release, this strong start to the fiscal year positions us for another year of record breaking results. As a result of our first quarter results, we are updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be in the range of $5.160 billion to $5.225 billion and fiscal 2017 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.55 to $4.63. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy, future share buybacks, or any future financial impact from our acquisition of G&K, including any transaction expenses. It does include the impact of one less workday in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. It also assumes a negative impact in the remaining quarters of fiscal 2017 from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 such that we expect to end fiscal 2017 with an estimated net benefit to EPS of $0.07. Again, please note that the net benefit to EPS from ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of $0.14 is expected to be only a $0.07 benefit for the full year as the impacts are negative in the second, third and fourth quarters of the year. Before I turn the call over to Paul, I'd like to provide a brief update on our acquisition of G&K. We remain excited about this opportunity and a long-term value creation for Cintas, its employee partners and its shareholders. When we announced the transaction in August, we indicated that the merger was subject to approval by G&K shareholders, regulatory clearances in both the US and Canada and other customary closing conditions. We and G&K have begun the process for satisfying these closing conditions. And at this stage, we don't expect the closing timeline to change materially from what we previously disclosed. In order to avoid creating speculation, we will not be providing any additional commentary on the process. We will however update the market as appropriate.  I will now turn the call over to Paul for additional information. Paul Adler : Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains one less workday than in fiscal year 2016. It is the third quarter of fiscal 2017 that has one less day than the prior year quarter. We estimate that this will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points and operating margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 5.7% in the first quarter. This solid growth rate continuous to be driven largely by new business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services, and strong customer retention. Total company gross margin was 45.1% for the first quarter of this fiscal year, compared to 43.7% last year. We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services, and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment included the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1 billion, an increase of 6.5% compared to last year's first quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and acquisitions, organic growth was 5.9%.  We continued to see the impact of headcount reductions in the oil, gas and coal industries. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from affected customers lowered our organic growth rate by about 110 basis points in the first quarter. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.9% for the first quarter, an increase of 120 basis points from 44.7% in last year's first quarter.  Energy related costs were 30 basis points lower than in last year's first quarter. However, job losses previously mentioned in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year first quarter operating margin by about 55 basis points. So, on a net basis, the low price of oil had a negative impact on our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin of 25 basis points because the benefit of lower prices at the pump for our fleet of trucks was more than offset by the negative impact to operating margin resulting from headcount reductions in our oil, gas and coal customers. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of First Aid products, Safety Products, and Training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $125 million, which was 25% higher than last year's first quarter. Total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. On an organic basis, growth for this segment was 5.4%. Our legacy First Aid business continuous to grow strongly. The reduction in overall segment organic growth is due to the continued assimilation of the ZEE Medical business. Route consolidation and optimization continued in the first quarter as expected. These efforts had a short-term impact to growth rates as we onboard and goodwill the acquired customers and train the SSRs on our products, services and processes. Our integration gain plan remains on track and we expect to end this fiscal year with stronger growth rates. This segment's gross margin was 45.8% in the first quarter compared to 42.3% in the prior year period, an increase of 350 basis points. Also, we are pleased to note that gross margin improved on a sequential basis by 290 basis points. Our margins benefiting from improved sourcing and from the leveraging of existing warehouses which are among the synergies we anticipate at realizing.  Finally, now that we are nearing completion of consolidation and route optimization, we've added sales reps. ZEE Medical have a dedicated sales force as the business previously relied only upon SSRs to grow the business. The added sales reps will help us grow the acquired customer base by penetrating with our broad range of products and services.  Our Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $170 million, an increase of 5.4% compared to last year's first quarter. Organic growth was 5.2%. All Other gross margin was 45.1% for the first quarter, an increase of 150 basis points from 38.6% in last year's first quarter.  Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 28.9% as a percentage of first quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's first quarter of 28.2%. Of the 70 basis point increase in SG&A year-over-year about 10 basis points is due to additional employee share based compensation expense resulting from the adoption of ASU 2016-09. Another 10 basis points consist of SAP cost related to the piloted operations. In addition, Medical expenses as a percentage of revenue were 20 basis points higher in this year's first quarter. Finally, SG&A was impacted by the investment in First Aid sales reps previously mentioned.  On June 1st, $250 million of debt, with a coupon of 2.85%, matured. We refinanced this debt in the form of commercial paper. By staying short in commercial paper, we were able to reduce interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 by about $2 million, and avoid a headwind that would result from financing with long-term debt. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter was 28.4% compared to 37.2% for last year's first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate year-over-year is attributable to adoption of ASU 2016-09. However, as Mike stated earlier, we estimate a negative impact to EPS in the remaining quarters of fiscal 2017 from this accounting standard. We expect the annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 to be about 34.7%. Our cash and marketable securities were $163 million as of August 31st, a decrease of $46 million from the balances of May 31st. Cash flow from operating activities increased 10% from the prior year period and when excluding last year's positive impact from document management transactions, it increased 13%. Uses of cash in the quarter included CapEx and repayment of debt.  Capital expenditures for the first quarter was $78 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows, $67 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $8 million in First Aid and Safety, and $3 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $280 million to $320 million. This range includes about $40 million of CapEx related to our SAP implementation. Regarding SAP, we continue with our pilot process which is progressed as expected. We believe that we will begin depreciating the project around December. Our fiscal year 2017 will include about a half a year of depreciation. It will also include about half a year of system maintenance costs. The conversion of our hundreds of operations to SAP has begun and will extend through fiscal 2018. Training costs, which are expensed when incurred as opposed to amortize over time, will exist in both fiscal 2017 and 2018. As is customary in such a conversion, we expect to have other additional costs in 2017 and 2018 as a result of inefficiencies until the old system is completely off-line. We are pleased with conversion and based upon our experience to date, we are updating our SAP impact to guidance. We now estimate that the investment in SAP will result in about $25 million to $30 million of expense in fiscal 2017 and $40 million to $45 million of expense in fiscal 2018. The estimated fiscal 2017 expenses are included in our 2017 guidance. That concludes our prepared remarks. Before opening it up for questions I'd like to reiterate Mike's earlier statements about the G&K acquisition process. In order to avoid speculation, we will not provide any additional commentary on that process. We will update the market however as appropriate.  And with that we are happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will hear first from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : Hi, good afternoon. It looks like you are raising your guidance by about $0.19 at the midpoint, and you mentioned the $0.07 benefit from the tax change. Could you just give a little bit of color on the main drivers behind the rest of the increase? Is it more margin driven? I saw uniform margins were extremely strong this quarter, so just wanted to get a little color on that -- the remainder of the increase in guidance? Mike Hansen : Sure. So there are a couple pieces. First of all as you indicated the ASU 2016-09 is about $0.07. That is again not simply a tax change but a guidance -- FASB guidance change that affects stock comp, shares and taxes. So about $0.07 is from there. Our share count is a little bit lower than we anticipated and Paul maybe you can give the share count that we are going to model. Paul Adler : Yes. We are modeling a 108 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Mike Hansen : And so keeping in mind that you will have to take into account participating securities when you calculate EPS but that's a little bit lower than we expected. So that has some impact. There is a little bit of an impact when we think about SAP. And then there is certainly margins got off to a good start and then we are very pleased with that first quarter performance. So those are a little bit of different pieces. Toni Kaplan : Okay, fantastic. And then I know you mentioned you don't want to talk about the G&K process, so if you don't want to answer this that's fine, but just wanted to ask in terms of -- assuming the deal were to close, how high would you expect sort of retention of G&K's workforce in light of the integration? Do you have specific retention targets for the workforce and/or for their revenue? If that's a little too close to the process, I understand. Mike Hansen : Well, we certainly have some thoughts on synergies that we gave when we announced the transaction. This is a fairly large merger for us and we talked about a couple of the benefits being that in certain markets we need capacity. And G&K has some capacity that we certainly can take advantage of that may allow us to defer some building of plants. We also look forward to the -- when we incorporate their route structure into ours, we expect improved route density. So improvements in terms of the fuel usage and certainly less time driving from customer to customer. In order to those things, we need a lot of people from G&K. And so while I don't have any specific numbers to shares, we won't be able to get into that level of detail until we close the transaction. We certainly anticipate that many of those employees of G&K will come over to become Cintas partners. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Jay Hanna : Hi, this is Jay Hanna on the line for Gary today. Regarding gross margins, they seemed to expand pretty dramatically across all the segments, particularly within first aid? Could you just explain what some of the main contributors were to this expansion? Paul Adler : Yes. I mean at first stage Jay as we noted in the script, we are excited to finally see some of the synergies that we banked on. They come from many different areas. For example, one is insourcing. Our ability to source the various products is much better with our scale than with ZEE. We expected to be able to have better ability to purchase and we are seeing those benefits in cost of goods which translate into that gross margin. We also are seeing benefits from distribution. They had five distribution centers. We've closed almost all of them. And so we are leveraging our fixed cost structure, our distribution supply chain for that. And other example was we mentioned warehousing in the script which is the location, physical operation that we run the routes of. As we had talked about previously with our scale even though this is a sizeable acquisition for the First Aid segment, it was largely a tuck in and by tucking this business in to those existing locations we were starting to realize those synergies. And that's really what's pushing those margins forward as I said we expected. Jay Hanna : Great. And then lastly, G&K released a proxy couple of weeks ago which included some of their internal forecasts which included sales growth at 6% plus, and EBITDA growth in the low double-digits. Would you be willing to comment on these? Are they similar to your expectations going forward? Mike Hansen : We don't have any comments on those. Those were G&K numbers and we'll let their proxies speak for itself. Operator : And we will go to Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Greg Bardi : This is actually Greg calling on for Manav. I just want to talk a little bit more about the part of the guidance change that isn't the tax change, the SAP and specifically what's driving there. And also kind of curious, if the fact that you're waiting on this G&K deal impacts how you're thinking about hiring for Cintas standalone and if there is any impact there in guidance? Mike Hansen : So let me make sure I understand the question. What was your first question or your first part of the question was more color on the SAP? Greg Bardi : No. The question is on the part of the guidance change that isn't related to SAP or the tax. Mike Hansen : Okay. Yes, when we think about the guidance that we provided it excludes any impact from G&K. And that would be any benefits, any synergies, any transaction costs et cetera. So the guidance that we are providing is based on Cintas performance. Greg Bardi : Okay. I guess my question was more along lines of does that -- has it impacted how you think about hiring I guess new sales force or what have you because you know or you are thinking that G&K will come online. Mike Hansen : Well, I'd say Greg that we certainly have thoughts about how the integration will occur once the transaction closes but we need to close the transaction first. Greg Bardi : Okay. Fair enough. And then I was hoping for a little more color on the lower growth in First Aid. What are the moving pieces there? Are you exiting less profitable parts of the medical or any color to help us with what's going on there? Paul Adler : Yes, Greg. I mean I don't think there is anything much else to add. I mean this is in the scheme of things for that segment. Again, it is a significant chunk of the segment that added one third of the volume. And just think about the math with getting to that 5% organic growth rate two thirds of that business the legacy business it's growing strongly. But the other, the acquired business I mean the focus has been on integration and goodwill and training those SSRs. You have to get the stability in the customer base, establish that foundation that takes time to build those relationships before you can make the emphasis on growth. And so there hasn't been much growth in that acquired business which is as expected but as we mentioned previously we do intend to grow it. And we are implementing, not implementing but we've hired some sales reps, getting them trained because we are at the end of -- near the end of the consolidation, the integration and the optimization process so that these sales reps then would be able to hit the ground running and start penetrating with the other products and services that we have in First Aid that ZEE did not previously have. Mike Hansen : Yes, Greg. This is a bit of unique opportunity for us in that I think Paul mentioned in his opening remarks that their drives or SSRs are the -- they were the sellers of that organization. And while we are going through the system integration, it doesn't make a lot of sense to bring on sales people to try to sell product on a different system and then retrain them on our system. And so this is a logical progression and a logical investment for this particular acquisition. Operator : Thank you. We will go to new one to Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Hamzah Mazari : Good afternoon. Thank you. Just had a question around adding dedicated sales reps that you highlighted on ZEE Medical. Should we expect other businesses aside from uniform to have direct sales reps too as those businesses either gain critical mass or is this sort of more differentiated or how should we think about that going forward? Mike Hansen : Sure. This is -- you should think about this first aid investment in sales people as a unique example. We are in our other businesses and even in the first aid business; we are generally investing in the business every single quarter. So in other words we are adding routes for growth, we are adding sales people. We are investing in all of our businesses and it happens at generally fairly steady pace. This is a unique example where we are now that we are on the system platform; it makes all kind of sense to add the investment. And we'll start -- our expectation is that we will start to see productivity as we throughout the year. Hamzah Mazari : Great. And just a follow up if you could just update us pro forma on your capital structure post G&K and how to think about capital allocation post that deal closing. Thank you. Mike Hansen : Yes. Sure. So we are -- our expectation is to pay for that transaction in cash. So in other words we will be borrowing with part short term, part long term borrowings. Our goal is to -- that was certainly get us to leverage levels that are not typical for us. And our goal over the next two to three years is to bring that leverage level back in line with where we've historically been and that is generally at about 2x EBITDA. Operator : And we will now go to Dan Dolev from Nomura Securities. Dan Dolev : Hey, guys. Hey thanks for taking my questions. If I go back to last year the same time you also raised your revenue guidance quite significantly. I think by about 220 basis points. What should we read into the no increase to the revenue guidance? Thanks. Mike Hansen : Last year's first quarter revenue guidance was increased quite a bit because of the ZEE acquisition. We closed that deal on August 1st of last year. And that was the primary reason for the change. Dan Dolev : Got it. So there is nothing to be read into that this year. Mike Hansen : I think our raising of the low end of the guidance today is a bit of reflection that we feel better today than we did 60 days ago about the revenue performance. Generally it is in line with where we expected to be but maybe slightly better. So I don't think there is anything to read into but I would say this Dan we -- let maybe talk a little bit about the economy and thinking in terms of -- it's been -- it remains a challenging environment and I'd -- I think I called it stable without momentum in July and I would say the same thing today. And if you look at the last three quarters of GDP in US, the average is slightly under 1%. The three quarters preceding our first quarter last year that average was 2.3%. And so we've certainly seen a bit more of a challenging environment. But having said that, we are operating a high level we believe and that organic growth of 5.7% in total is a reflection that even in a bit of more challenging environment today than a year ago, we are still growing at pretty good levels. Dan Dolev : Understood. And how do you feel about this growth rate throughout the rest of the year? Mike Hansen : Well, I think our guidance would suggest that we feel pretty good about it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Nate Brochmann : Hi. Good evening, gentlemen. So just follow up on that little bit Mike if we kind of think about like about add stop metric I would assume that's still somewhat neutral if we exclude the oil and gas folks in terms of that end market. And one if you could comment on that and two when you think about the oil and gas sector are you starting to see the incremental negative decline kind of plateau a little bit so as we think about over the next 12 months that should be a little bit more of stable impact rather than a drag? Mike Hansen : Yes. Our hope is that we've seen the bottom. I know we've kind of hope that would have been the case for last several quarters but I would suggest that top line impact -- negative impact is somewhere in the 80 basis points to 100 basis points for the fiscal year. That's a little higher than we talked about in July but a little bit better than our first quarter experience. That said, we also talked a little bit about the prices at the pump getting a little bit higher as the years go on. And I would suggest that based on our first quarter experience it might not be as high as we thought it to be originally. So let me talk two things. First of all, yes, the revenue we expect that impact will lessen as we go through the year. From a net standpoint when you think about prices at the pump plus the negative impact of the revenue, I'd suggest that it's about the same as we thought it to be in July. One last point if I go back to Dan's question about revenue for the rest of the year. One thing to keep in mind is in the first quarter we now have lapped that ZEE acquisition. And so now our future growth -- our future revenue growth for the rest of the year will not have the revenue, the acquisition benefit going forward from that ZEE deal. Paul Adler : And Nate, answer your question specifically about add stop, so you are correct that in that metric outside of the FRC related to the energy customers there is nothing really noteworthy, the metric is slightly positive but it typically is positive. This time of the year we have some seasonal impacts with schools and other summer type business is coming on in June. It is less positive than a year ago however. Nate Brochmann : Okay. That's helpful, I appreciate that. And then in terms of the pricing environment, I mean obviously I know it's always competitive out there and a little bit more competitive on renewals rather than new wins, but anything at all in terms of any changes that you have seen, particularly maybe after or since you've announced the acquisition? Paul Adler : No. Nate, as you said it's always very competitive, no, nothing remarkable in the environment that indicates any change one way or the other. Nate Brochmann : Okay. And then just finally, just one technical question on the ASUs, and not to get too deep into accounting knowledge here, but why, just out of curiosity, why do you get such the big positive benefit in this quarter and then it turns negative the remaining quarters? And then when we look at next year should the comps be about equal? What kind of -- obviously I know the underlying number of employees and how well the bonus pulls do and whatever, I'm sure that would have an impact. But how should we think about that dynamic and why that change? Mike Hansen : Yes. I think that's a good question, Nate. We will generally see a bigger impact in our first quarter because our restricted shares that we have generally vest in the first quarter, our stock, we have more stock option exercises just for whatever reasons it is the end of our -- it is getting end of the year our fiscal year and into our new fiscal year. So we have more stock option exercises. In this quarter, we also had a nice increase in our stock price. So when that the volatility is created by stock price movement, option exercises, vesting of restricted shares and we generally have more of that in the first quarter, as we move through the rest of the year we generally don't see as many of those exercises and vestings but we still carry the additional stock comp expense and we still carry the additional shares created by this new guidance. Nate Brochmann : So essentially then, the expense outweighs the tax benefit in the upcoming quarters, versus the huge tax benefit in the first quarter? Is that essentially the way to think about it? Mike Hansen : It is. That is our expectation. Now as I said, there are -- we can't control the stock pricing, we can't control when options are exercised necessarily and so there can still be volatility but you are correct in the assumptions that you just stated. Nate Brochmann : Okay. And just one less cleanup thing just to ask and I think it was something that you had mentioned before. But now with the new rule that is going into place in terms of the overtime and where the thresholds are, I assume that you have kind of thought about that at this point and are pretty comfortable that the impact from that will be fairly minimal, if anything? Mike Hansen : We have thought about that. And yes we don't see a significant impact to us. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go to George Tong with Piper Jaffray. George Tong : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you discuss any new findings from your due diligence of G&K that either confirm or change your expectations for total synergies that you previously guided to $130 million to $140 million? And any incremental color on how this will split between revenue and cost synergies? Mike Hansen : George, we don't have any new commentary to add on that process at all. George Tong : Okay. And then related to your comment on adding to ZEE Medical sales force, can you elaborate on how much you are adding to the sales force and how much of a lift to revenue performance these additions will drive? Mike Hansen : George, we don't like to get into specifics about sales expenses or counts. But we can tell you that our expectations are incorporated into our guidance. George Tong : Okay, got it. And then lastly, can you discuss how you expect your route efficiency on a standalone Cintas basis to evolve over the next four quarters? Mike Hansen : On Cintas standalone basis I would say I think I mentioned a little bit ago that we are constantly investing in the business. And one of those investments is to add routes to allow for continued growth in all of our businesses. And we will continue to do that. And when we add those routes, it creates more density and so that means we are having less windshield time and so there are certainly some incremental benefits every time we add new routes. We also expect that the productivity of our drivers or SSRs will improve over time as we add those routes and have more time to spend with our customers. Operator : Our next question comes from Sara Gubins with Bank of America. Sara Gubins : Yes, hi, thank you. You lowered the cost hit from SAP this year, but you mentioned that the pilot had been going as expected, so I'm wondering, is it that you expect lower cost related to SAP specifically or are you finding cost savings elsewhere to help offset that what you were originally expecting? Mike Hansen : Yes. I think I heard you properly so if I am missing the question please let me know. But to answer your question, we are finding that we are just simply spending less on the integration so far than are initially expected. It doesn't really have to do with offset; it is more about the specific SAP integration. Sara Gubins : Okay, great. And then hopefully you can hear me. Could you comment on expected wage cost and any trends you might be seeing there? Mike Hansen : We are seeing in certain specific markets there are more pressures than in others. We operate in many, many markets around the US and Canada. And I'd say that we are not seeing specific themes nationally. But there are certainly are some markets here and there that are more -- that are tighter than others. We deal with those all the time, that's not something that is particularly new. And it's our job to execute and to get the right people at the right places and time. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go to John Healy with Northcoast Research. John Healy : Thank you. Mike, I wanted to ask you a question, just from a top line perspective. I think it's pretty impressive as you continue to put up this kind of organic growth this late into what could arguably be described as late into an economic cycle. Is there anything, when you look at the business that maybe we don't get by just looking at the organic growth rate? Do you see a segment of the marketplace, whether it's healthcare or hospitality or some sort of end market that is just doing something that's exceptional as well as just from a regional performance when you look at the company today? I believe the West Coast had always been a tougher region for all the uniform companies, but is there anything that's driving this growth rate that would surprise us or not be obvious to us? Mike Hansen : I think it's the things that we talked about in the past, John. And the exciting thing to us is it is not necessarily vertical driven, it is really about the innovative products and services that we've been able to create over the last several number of years. And it's about the great execution by our partners. We believe that we can add value to any business in the US and Canada with our products and services. And we are going about doing that and that is kind of vertical agnostic. We believe every kind of business is a potential customer. And we are targeting them as such. So we want to continue to look for new opportunities to sell our for example our signature series hygiene products. We want to look for new innovative solutions and ways to sell our Carhartt products for our scrub rental programs, for our chemical cleaning solutions. We've got a lot of innovative products and services that we created and they can really add value to lots of different kinds of businesses. And so I think it's that. It's the execution by our partners and it's a great product line. John Healy : Got you, and I want ask on the acquisition of G&K. You talked about the $130 million to $140 million in synergies, is that kind of a big picture number? And would you expect the synergies to be less than that post purchase accounting? Mike Hansen : Well, I'd say that when we announced in August we talked about the $130 million to $140 million in annual synergies. That is looking at their cost structure primarily. And there certainly are things that will let say subtract from that like the interest cost related to the financing like the amortization of intangibles. So that's a bit of a big picture what are the synergies and we would not -- we did not include the interest expense and the intangible amortization as a net against those --. John Healy : Was there an assumption for the inventory, the garments in the stock rooms and things like that? Mike Hansen : Well, we have thoughts on that. We didn't share any in August and I am not ready to do that today. We need to get the deal closed and that when we can dive into more of the details. And really get more specific. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks, good afternoon, guys. A couple clarification questions first. With regard to the SAP number down a little bit, this was asked earlier, but is it going to be pushed out, or is it just the less on integration spend? And why I'm asking is I'm wondering if you're holding things up waiting for the closing of the G&K acquisition, or it's just pure integration savings? Mike Hansen : I think it's just we are spending less on the integration in the early periods that kind of lead us to think we maybe more efficient over the course of the integration. Scott Schneeberger : All right, thanks. And then a real quickie, on the accounting change you mentioned that fiscal first quarter is typically going to be the big one, and obviously it's going to be a headwind in the coming three. In our modeling, should we just equal weight the next three quarters, or is there any seasonality to that we should think about? Mike Hansen : I think that's a reasonable assumption to equal weight. Scott Schneeberger : All right, thanks. And then obviously we have the election coming up, so I will be that guy and ask the question, but it sounds like infrastructure is probably going to be strong under either candidate. Thoughts on that and then trade maybe not so much. I'm not sure that would have an impact, but if you could address those two if meaningful or anything else you think are resulting from what you have heard thus far. Thanks. Mike Hansen : I think it's -- I would say that it's a little unclear for us to get specific on any kind of future benefits. We will certainly operate in whatever environment occurs after the election. And it's too early to tell and too early to try build any kind of specific assumption. Operator : Thank you. With no additional questions in the queue, I'll turn things back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Mike Hansen : Well, thank you very much for joining us tonight. We appreciate it. We will issue our second quarter earnings in the end of December. And we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, again that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all again for your participation.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Hansen : Good evening and thank you for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our second quarter results for fiscal 2017. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We are pleased to report that revenue for the second quarter which ended November 30 was $1.297 billion, an increase of 6.4% over last year's second quarter. The organic growth rate which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 5.7%. Organic growth for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment accelerated to a rate of 6.5% from 5.9% in our first quarter. Second quarter gross margin improved to 44.1% from 43.3% last year. Scott Farmer, Cintas' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer stated in today's press release that this is our 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement. As Scott mentioned this accomplishment plus our industry leading organic sales growth is a great reflection of the significant opportunities we have ahead of us and of the great execution of our employees whom we call partners. Gross margin of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment improved to 44.7%, an increase of 80 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. The First Aid and Safety segment gross margin improved to 46.1% representing both the year-over-year and the sequential increase of 290 and 30 basis points respectively, due to the realization of synergies from the acquisition of ZEE Medical in fiscal 2016. Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 of $203 million increased 1.3% from last year's second quarter. Operating income margin was 15.6% compared to 16.4% in last year's second quarter. Second quarter operating income included $3.3 million or 0.3% of second quarter revenue of transaction expenses related to the previously announced agreement to acquire G&K Services. Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter was $123 million compared to $115 million in last year's second quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter were $1.13 which included a negative $0.02 impact from G&K transaction expenses, compared to $1.03 in last year's second quarter. Second quarter net income and EPS from continuing operations increased 6.9% and 9.7% respectively compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the negative impact of the G&K acquisition expenses net income and EPS from continuing operations increased 8.8% and 11.7% respectively compared to last year's second quarter, and net income margin from continuing operations improved to 9.7% compared to 9.5% in last year's second quarter. We're updating our annual guidance, we expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be in the range of $5.180 billion to $5.225 billion, and fiscal 2017 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.57 to $4.65. This guidance includes the benefit from our adoption of accounting standards update 2016-09 entitled improvements to employees share based payment accounting, and the impact of one less workday in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. This guidance also includes second quarter year-to-date G&K transaction Expenses, but does not include any future G&K transaction expenses. Please refer to the table in today's press release for more information.  As Scott Farmer was recorded [ph] in today's press release, we are pleased with our second quarter results. They've put us in a solid position to again achieve record revenue and to grow our EPS double digits for the seventh consecutive year. We thank our partners for striving to exceed expectations and in doing so delivering best in class results. Before I turn the call over to Paul, I'd like to provide a brief update on our acquisition of G&K. We are excited about this opportunity and the long-term value creation for Cintas, its employee partners and its shareholders. When we announced the transaction in August, we indicated that the merger was subject to approval by G&K shareholders, regulatory clearances in both the U.S. and Canada and other customary closing conditions. The merger was approved by G&K shareholders in November. We continue to work toward obtaining regulatory clearance and completing the other closing conditions. We remain optimistic that the deal will close no later than the end of the second calendar quarter of 2017. In order to avoid creating speculation, we will not be providing any additional commentary on this process. We will update the market going forward as appropriate. I will now turn the call over to Paul for additional information. Paul Adler : Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains one less workday than in fiscal year 2016. It is the third quarter of fiscal 2017 that has one less day than the prior year quarter. We estimate that this will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points and operating margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. For those of you modeling our results by quarter please keep this in mind. Our third quarter is generally not as strong as the fourth quarter due to reasons including the resetting of payroll taxes, and this year it will also be negatively impacted by one less day of revenue. In addition energy comps will be very difficult in our third quarter as gasoline and diesel prices were at their lowest levels in last year's third quarter. And finally we will spend more on the branding campaign in the third quarter than in the fourth quarter.  As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 5.7% in the second quarter. Driven largely by new business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services, and strong customer retention. Total company gross margin was 44.1% for the second quarter of this fiscal year, compared to 43.3% last year, an improvement of 80 basis points. We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services, and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment included the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was a little over $1 billion, an increase of 7.2% compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and acquisitions. The organic growth rate was 6.5%. We continue to see the impacts of weakness in the oil, gas and coal industries, however, we believe that we have hit the bottom. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from affected customers lowered our organic growth rate by about 75 basis points in the second quarter. This compares to about 110 basis point impact in the previous quarter. Our Uniform Rental and Facilities Services segment gross margin was 44.7% for the second quarter, an increase of 80 basis points from 43.9% in last year\u2019s second quarter. Energy related costs were 10 basis points lower than in last year's second quarter. However, job losses previously mentioned in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year second quarter operating margin by about 40 basis points. So, on a net basis, the low price of oil had a negative impact on our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin of 30 basis points because the benefit of lower prices at the pump for our fleet of trucks was more than offset by the negative impact to operating margin resulting from weakness in our oil, gas and coal customers. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of First Aid products, Safety Products, and Training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $125 million, which was about 4% higher than last year's second quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 3.3%. The reduction in overall segment organic growth is due to the continued assimilation of the ZEE Medical business. Route consolidation and optimization continued in the second quarter as expected. However, in examining the monthly organic growth rates of the second quarter, we believe that we saw the bottom followed by an upswing in the growth rates in the final months of the quarter. We previously disclosed that we added sales reps in our first quarter. ZEE Medical did not have a dedicated sales force as the business previously relayed only upon SSRs to grow the business. The added sales reps were help us grow the acquired customer base by penetrating with our broad range of products and services. As a result of this investments in addition to a bottoming of growth rates in the second quarter, we expect improving organic growth rates through the remainder of this fiscal year. This segment's gross margin was 46.1% in the second quarter compared to 43.2% in last year's second quarter, an increase of 290 basis points. Also, we are pleased to note that gross margin improved again on a sequential basis, this time by 30 basis points. Our margins are benefiting from the realization of acquisition synergies, including improved sourcing and the leveraging of existing warehouses. We have about 16 months of results since the ZEE acquisition. There is more work to be done and exciting opportunities ahead. However, we are very pleased with progress and performance to date. Large acquisitions have a short term impact to growth rates as we on board and good will the acquired customers and train the SSRs on our products, services and processes. This is typical, and we know that growth rates will soon improve. In the interim we have made significant strides in expanding gross margin. Our year-to-date gross margin dollars are up 53% over two years ago and up 22% over last year. Our year-to-date gross margin percentage is almost back to pre-ZEE levels and our revenue of course is significantly greater.  Our Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $167 million, an increase of 3.5% compared to last year's second quarter. Organic growth rate was 2.8%. All Other gross margin was 38.5% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 39.6% for last year's second quarter. As we have mentioned previously the Direct Sale business by its nature is not the recurring revenue stream that our other businesses are, such as Uniform Rental and Facilities Services and First Aid. Therefore the growth rates are generally low and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multi-million dollar account. Our Fire business however continues to grow at a rapid pace, the Fire business organic growth rate was a little over 10% and operating margin expanded. Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 28.2% as a percentage of second quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's second quarter of 26.8%. The increase was the result of strategic investments, as well as the 70 basis point increase in employee medical expenses. The strategic investments include a new enterprise resource planning system, the national branding campaign ready for the work day and sales resources to grow recently acquired customers and our First Aid and Safety segments.  Regarding the increase in medical expenses, note that we\u2019re self-insured and we had a handful of atypical very expensive claims in the quarter. I mentioned that SG&A was impacted by our investments in an enterprise resource planning system, namely SAP. SAP amounted to about 20 basis points of expenses related to the piloted operations. We continue to be pleased with the conversion efforts and the capabilities of the new system. Since last quarter\u2019s earnings call, more locations have been included in the pilots, also with the upcoming acquisition of G&K we\u2019re planning and adjusting our SAP implementation plan as necessary.  Our internal SAP resources are involved in this effort, as a result we expect SAP expenses in fiscal 2017 to be less and estimate a range of $20 million to $25 million. As of November 30, short term debt was comprised of commercial paper in the amount of $66 million. We expect this amount to be temporally higher as of the end of the third quarter due to payment of our regular dividend. On December 2, we paid an annual dividend of $1.33 per share, an increase of 26.7% over last year\u2019s annual dividend. We\u2019ve increased this dividend for 33 consecutive years, which is every year since we went public in 1983. The annual dividend is an important part of our capital allocation strategy and illustrates our enduring commitment to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we entered into an interest rate lock agreement with a notational value of $550 million for our forecasted debt issuance, in anticipation of debt issuance for the closing of the G&K acquisition and to protect same cost from rising interest rates. We recent entered into interest rate lock agreements with a notional value of $950 million. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter was 34.9% compared to 37.4% for last year's second quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate year-over-year is attributable to both the favorable settlement of a prior year federal tax audit and the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on stock compensation. We expect the annual effective tax rate for continuing operations for fiscal 2017 to be about 34.7%. Our cash balance as of November 30 was $143 million and we had no marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash and marketable securities decreased about $20 million from the balances of August 31st. Cash flow from operating activities as of November 30 year-to-date increased 14% from the prior year period. Uses of cash in the second quarter included CapEx and repayments of debt. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were about $76 million our CapEx by operating segment was as follows, $66 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $6 million in First Aid and Safety and $4 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $290 million to $310 million. This range includes about $40 million of CapEx related to our SAP implementation. Finally, in the second quarter we received a payment from the buyer of our investment in Shredit, proceeds were about $26 million and recorded in the investing section of the cash flow statement. That concludes our prepared remark. We are happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We do have our first question from Minaz Putnik with Barclays Capital. Minaz Putnik : Good evening gentlemen, thanks for the call, first question is just around the acceleration in the Uniform Rentals business, maybe just a little bit more color related -- was it broad based, was it a couple of -- was it selling more mat and towels, anything there, how sustainable do you think that is? Mike Hansen : Well we saw our organic growth from the first quarter this second quarter accelerated about 60 basis points as Paul said about 35 basis points was because of the lessening oil and gas customer impact and so I guess I would say you know we've seen quite steady performance except for that vertical for some time now and I would say that that is sustainable as we move forward in this economic type of environment, if we see the economy change one way or the other we may see some change, but we feel very good about our execution and that's kind of where we've been, that's where our results have been for a number of quarters except for that one vertical. Minaz Putnik : And I think Paul has said that you think oil and gas is at the bottom, 75 base impact in 2Q, how should we think of that impact in the quarter lessening going forward like is 35 basis points the right number like you saw this quarter? Paul Adler : Yes Minaz, this is Paul. We estimate that that headwind that went from 110 to 75 will continue to step down in Q3 and Q4 such that you know for the full year the headwind would probably be in the 75 to 85 basis point range for the full year. Minaz Putnik : And then just on First Aid and Safety, your comments on improving growth rate for the remainder fiscal year, again just some color on -- from 3.3 how do we step it up? I know you talked about monthly it was better, I was wondering if you could maybe put some numbers on those monthly rates, or any color on how we should model that? Mike Hansen : Paul mentioned that we saw some acceleration through the quarter, in the last month of the quarter we were about 4.5 and I would expect to see step up from there in the third and then little bit more step up in the fourth. We're not ready to give particular guidance, but we expect that to return to that high single-digit low double-digits overtime, and we certainly expect to make progress on that in the back half of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : SG&A was a little bit higher than we had expected in the quarter even adjusting for the transaction expenses and you called out SAP in the national branding campaign and medical expenses as been big drivers there, SAP you're going to keep investing in this year, but just when we think about the other two would you expect those to come down at all, or would you expect sort of double-digit SG&A expense growth for the rest of '17 as well? Mike Hansen : I would say this, first of all Paul called out medical and certainly medical was a spike of 70 basis points this quarter, again as he said, we had some -- we had a combination of a handful of high dollar claims that hit us this quarter. We don't see that as a trend going forward. As it relates to the other items that Paul pointed out in terms of -- let me speak to SAP for a second, we certainly have guided for more SAP expense in the back half of the year, as we kind of move out of the pilot and into the full implementation. The spend that we have talked about tonight $20 million to $25 million, you can imagine the bulk of that is in the second half of the year. But it is lower because we're starting to combine a little bit the SAP and the G&K system conversion and so we're going to make sure that we've a coordinated effort to move forward in the right way with both of those projects. If you kind of think about the first half of the year, the first quarter we were up about 70 basis points over last year. Second quarter without that medical spike we're up 70 basis points and we will continue to invest in SAP in preparation for the G&K closing. And we'll have some of that ready for the workday. So, yes, Toni, we will see some heightened SG&A as we continue to prepare for these two large projects. We want to make sure that we are providing the right resources for each of them. Toni Kaplan : Can you talk about how you're anticipating the impact from the new administration will be, whether it's on taxes, labor growth, wages or anything else that you think will be especially impactful to your business. Mike Hansen : Certainly we've seen a lot of positive sentiment and at this point in time it's just sentiment and so we've got ways to go before we see anything impactful, but having said that, look if we see lower corporate income tax rates that will be certainly beneficial for us because we're mostly a U.S. based company. If we see a repatriation opportunity certainly that's not significant for us, but if we see a lot of cash coming back and flowing into the economy that's going to be good for our customers and ultimately good for us. And then if we see some infrastructure spend that's going to be good for construction, for equipment and certainly that's going to benefit our customers and eventually benefit us. But I would say again Toni, we are a ways away from seeing anything yet and I -- as we think about our year, we are not including any benefits from changes from the new administration, we absolutely like how our year is going so far, we've got a very good organic growth rate, we've seen Rental continue to be strong First Aid is going to continue to be strong in the second half of the year. We've seen some really nice gross margins and gross margin improvements, so we feel like we've got a very healthy business that's executing very well and boy if we get some help in the back half of the year from changes from the new administration that will be even better. Toni Kaplan : Okay, thanks for the answers, and happy holidays. Operator : Our next question comes from Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Nate Brochmann : So I wanted to ask a couple of things. One, obviously over the last five years you've really kind of changed the direction of the company in terms of developing new end markets and new services and what not. Could you talk a little bit about how the culture has evolved along with that in terms of supporting those new entrepreneurial efforts? And also two, just kind of looking forward, where do you think the next milestones are over the next three to five years post integration at G&K and the SAP in terms of some of the ongoing efforts to continue those various growth drivers. Mike Hansen : Well you're right Nate. I think today and over the last five years, we've been a more innovative company than maybe 10 and 15 years ago. I think, if you go back kind of prior to the last cycle. We were kind of building the footprints still, we we're adding sales reps and we were getting a lot of growth in that manner. And as we fully build out that footprint, and as we got into the great recession, we started certainly to recognize that we can't wait for employment to come back and we have to be more innovative and we have to create products and services that our customers really value and want to use, we've got to create garments that our customers want to wear, not just have to wear. I think we've done a great job of that. And we\u2019ve got some active channels of feedback from our customers, from our service sales reps, we\u2019ve got an active R&D program, we are looking for vendors to partner with like Carhartt. And so we -- there is no doubt we kind of changed from a company 10 and 15 years ago where we were building a footprint to a company that really looking for more and unique ways of serving businesses. So as we move forward then, we\u2019ve got some exciting thing ahead obviously and that is the SAP and the G&K integrations. And as we move forward from there, I think there still are many opportunities to create products and services that pull even more types of customers into our customer base and to provide them with broader products and services. So we\u2019re going to continue to look for those kinds of opportunities. And Nate, I would say one of the biggest assets that we\u2019ve got certainly the biggest assets are our people and our culture, but really when you think about it, one of the biggest assets we have got is a great infrastructure to provide services close to a million businesses and we\u2019ve got that infrastructure that can reach many more businesses as well. And so we are a nice avenue for many vendors to provide products and services. And I think that\u2019s something that we can continue to take advantage of as we move forward. Nate Brochmann : Thanks, that\u2019s very helpful for the insight. And just one little bit of quick clarification, last question but, talking about the encouraging sentiment, I mean clearly we feel that throughout the market in terms of the economy and some of the larger corporations out there, when you say positive sentiment, are you referring to just kind of that nuance, are you hearing that out of your customers as well in terms of kind of maybe some of that individual positive sentiment percolating up a little bit from your sales force? Mike Hansen : Well, I think -- I would say more of it is coming from just kind of the general economic discussions, the rally in the stock market, the rise in the interest rate environment. I would say more of it is coming from that. When we think about the business, our specific business, in the second quarter, I would say if you kind of push aside a lot of this sentiment and noise, the economic environment for us in the second quarter didn\u2019t feel a whole lot different than its felt in last few quarters with the exception of that oil and gas vertical, not deteriorating anymore and maybe stabilizing a little bit. But generally speaking I would say the economic environment doesn\u2019t feel a whole lot different today than it has over the last few quarters. Nate Brochmann : Fair enough. Thank you very much for the time. Appreciated. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan. Andrew Steinerman : You presented the way you have your fiscal year 2017 EPS guide little bit differently in the second quarter press release and the first quarter press release, I just wanted to make sure, I was getting the math correct here, I believe that Cintas lowered the range of the 2017 EPS -- range of EPS before the accounting benefit and before the G&K transaction cost by $0.03, I could calculate, why I think it\u2019s $0.03, but I was just wondering is that the way you see the difference between the range before today and the range after today, when looking at EPS before counting benefit and before G&K costs? Mike Hansen : And just to make sure, did you say lowered by $0.03? Andrew Steinerman : EPS, yes I think you lowered the range by $0.03. Mike Hansen : That\u2019s not the way I see it. So when we think about the -- and by the way we added the table because it is a little bit -- there are some moving parts and we wanted to make sure that we were as clear as we could be about it. So when I think about the first quarter, our range overall was 455 to 463, and that included a negative $0.02 from G&K in the first quarter and at that time, we had told you, we thought that ASU impact was $0.07, would be $0.07 for the year. That kind of gets us to 450 to 458, compared to tonight\u2019s range or today\u2019s range of 451 to 459. So I would see it as, I mean it\u2019s really about the same but a penny higher. Operator : Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Hamzah Mazari : Mike just wondering, on your next financing cost, you spoke about locking in financing and interest rate, certain interest rate. Could you give us a sense of how we should think about pro forma and that financing cost and would that be an offset to your 130 million to 140 million synergy number you\u2019ve put out there for G&K? Mike Hansen : So back at August, when we announced the transaction, we had talked about a, roughly a 4% rate and I would expect that we\u2019ll be a little bit better than that. We have locked some of the rates, but not all of them. So there will still be some movement, but I would expect that we may be a little bit better than that. Hamzah Mazari : Okay and just last question, with the newer administration if there is a higher tariff on overseas sourcing, does that impact you guys at all or is that not material, and any color there would be great? Thank you. Mike Hansen : Well, we certainly have an active global supply chain and we source from all over the world and we do our best to take advantage of existing trade agreements. I would say if the new administration pulled back on existing trade agreements or made changes to existing trade agreements, there could be some impact and we\u2019ll do our best to work around that. So for example we have production in Haiti and we take advantage of the trade agreements with Haiti, we have some NAFTA benefits and if those go away then we\u2019ll certainly have to determine how to adjust. Having said that, when you think about the cost of materials for us, in specifically garments, let\u2019s keep in mind rental revenue is about 50% of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment. When you think about the cost of rentals we have the material cost, the production cost and the service cost, and so the material cost is certainly not the majority of that. When you think about then the material cost, the biggest cost in there is labor and so we'll work to see how can we manage that labor input as best we can. And so I guess what I am telling you is, it's a large part of our cost structure but it's not, it\u2019s not significant and it happens over a long period of time. So for example we have to go source it, then we bring it into our distribution center where is stays for a turn, then it gets shipped to our rental locations where we put it into service and we amortize it over 18 months. So it takes quite a while to see the full impact of changes to our sourcing, and while we're going through that long supply chain timeframe we would be working towards improving our sourcing capability. So we're keeping our eyes on it, no question about it, and we'll react appropriately. Operator : Next question comes from Andy Whitman with Robert W. Baird. Andy Whitman : Great so, hi guys I wanted to just -- a little bit more on the guidance question, I agree with you it\u2019s a I guess a penny raise, if you go a step further I guess you cut the SAP investment this year by about $5 million, that's $0.03 the other way, but then Healthcare looks like a surprise that was about a $0.04 hit in the positive direction if you add it back. So I guess those if you just assume SAP and Healthcare then you kind of, you\u2019re still back to the kind of flat to maybe a penny pick up, would you agree with that Mike. Mike Hansen : Yes, I would say its right around there Andy. You know when we think about our guidance for the second half of the year we think about, look we feel very good about the revenue, we feel very-very good about the gross margin, we have a healthy business and its executing well. We also have two very large and important projects ahead in SAP and in G&K, and we're going to make sure that we are investing in the right way to make sure that we implement those in the best way that we can. And so as I mentioned to Tony a little bit ago, we will continue to see some elevated SG&A because we're going to make sure we're ready for both of those projects and all of that's incorporated into that guidance. Andy Whitman : You know and you brought up the two big programs that you're running. It sounds like, you didn't say it this way, but sounds like you're moderating some of the spend this year on SAP because there's going to be a whole lot more work next year when G&K gets done. Would you agree with that? And then I guess the question is, is there an implication about the spending on SAP I think last quarter you said it was going to be $40 or $45 million that was cumulative not incremental to this year's number but $40 million to $45 million cumulative, do you still like that number as you look into 2018 or does that one move as well as you look at the G&K integration next year? Mike Hansen : I would say that it's getting a little bit combined with -- those two projects are getting fairly connected, and while we're not ready to say that that 40 to 45 is going to be different, we're going to have to continue to work on these as a coordinated effort. And so we may come and say, look when you combine the Cintas legacy effort along with the G&K, we may change the amount of spend, but I'm not ready to say that we will yet. I guess maybe one way to look at it from just a systems spend, is to say, we had originally looked at that SAP integration for ourselves as being the second half of fiscal '17 and then all of fiscal '18. And I think Paul and I have said over last couple of calls, as we insert G&K into that, it's likely going to go into fiscal '19, and we still believe that. And so there's probably going to be the same effort in fiscal '18 but just a little bit more effort in fiscal '19. That additional effort is incorporated into our thoughts on the G&K deal, and as you know we've talked about one of the longer polls in that in the synergy effort with G&K as that system conversion. And so we're going to be continuing to work on it, I'm not ready to change from the 40 to 45. But I think it will go into '19, just because we've got more locations. Does that answer your question? Andy Whitman : Yes, I think that does, it gives it a character of how you are thinking about it and thank you for that. I guess maybe the last question that I have then is stepping back and just looking at the fundamentals of the marketplace, I would like to hear some of your commentary on the AdStop [ph] trends that you're seeing in the marketplace, as well as any comments that you can give us on the overall level of competition as it relates to the pricing trend, recognizing that they're always competitive, but maybe they\u2019re less or more competitive today? That would helpful to give us some context of some of the drivers into that acceleration into organic growth. Paul Adler : The AdStops, the metric was positive this quarter, but it's typically positive. We get some benefit from seasonal items like jackets and some extra mats coming into the late fall into the early winter. The only thing noteworthy in AdStops was that the flame resistant garments FRC, that was more positive and that helps us support our conclusions that we think we have seen the bottom of that weakness in oil, gas and coal. Outside of that nothing noteworthy in AdStops, and in terms of pricing no change, it\u2019s still very competitive but nothing significant to speak off. Operator : Next we've George Tong with Piper Jaffray. George Tong : You indicated the bulk of your SAP spending this year will be in the back half, can you share how you're thinking about the timing of investments between 3Q and 4Q this year? Mike Hansen : I would say that there is going to be a little bit more in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter as we really get into the ramp up and -- so, I would say if you think about that remaining, I guess it's about 15 to 20 in the back half of the year, a little bit more of it is going to come in the fourth quarter. George Tong : Got it, and then secondly, can you discuss how much additional investment you need to make in the sales force to support accelerating revenue growth in ZEE Medical? Mike Hansen : Well we've already made that investment, we made it in -- primarily in the first quarter and so you are seeing that in those First Aid and Safety numbers that they are that investment that we made in the first quarter is now starting to become more productive and I don\u2019t expect to see any additional investments other than kind of the routine. George Tong : Go it. And then lastly as it relates to your medical claims costs. You saw some elevated atypical medical claims in the quarter. Can you maybe elaborate on why you believe the claims are atypical and then from an actuarial perspective if you'll need to accrue claims costs at a higher rate in future quarters? Paul Adler : The typical claims were just simply certain claims that were very high dollar because of the specific situation of the person. Because we don\u2019t expect a continued spike of this high dollar claims we generally don\u2019t need to necessarily include that in our IB&R [ph] going forward. George Tong : Got it, thank you. Operator : Next we have Joe Box with KeyBanc. Joe Box : So, obviously there is lot of commentary around why the organic rate in Uniform stepped up sequentially. But I was actually hoping that maybe you could deconstruct where the 6.5% organic growth is actually coming from. Maybe just give us the sort of commentary or directional feel on how much of that might have been price, how much of that might have been volume and then just anything maybe you can tell us about the Uniform specific growth rate versus the ancillary? Paul Adler : Well Joe, we don\u2019t usually get into the specific details. I can tell you, new business remains strong and we feel very good about reaching that new customer base through what we call no programmers or new customers that haven\u2019t had a Uniform Rental program. New business remains strong penetration remains strong with things like our signature series hygiene products and services with our entrance mats and I would say that we haven\u2019t seen much of a change in the mix of the revenue growth other than to say that oil and gas at customer base, the stops or the reduction in revenue at those types of customers has subsided a little bit. But aside from that it is continuing to execute the way we have for quite a while now and that is no programmers being very strong, new business efforts in total being strong and continuing to find penetration opportunities. Joe Box : Okay, appreciate that. And then we may or may not be coming out of the period of lower diesel costs. Have you guys given any consideration to maybe pushing through a surcharge mechanism to your customers or maybe doing hedging on that front? Paul Adler : We don\u2019t, that diesel or gas surcharge is not something that we do. And we are buying gas everyday all over the country and a hedging program is very, very difficult, it's not like we\u2019ve got large bulk buys at specific points in time and so no we don\u2019t typically get involved in a hedging program because it's just very, very difficult to do so. Operator : Our next question is from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : Could you guys address the branding campaign, maybe I am watching less TV, but I haven't seen as much as that as I did initially. Just curious what's going on and a little rehash of the quantification, past and forward, and also favorable impacts you think you may have seen thus far? Mike Hansen : Scott, you need to watch a lot more college football. But I mean, the rebranding campaign is going very well. We\u2019re still not far enough along that, we have enough of full body of work to be able to analyze and come back to you with return on our investments. But anecdotally what we are hearing from our partners, the customers, it\u2019s all very positive. In fiscal '16, we spent for the year about 25 basis points on the branding campaign and we expect that to be about the same impact here in fiscal '17. And as I said in the end of prepared remarks we will have a little bit heavier spend in our third quarter than in the fourth quarter. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. And then with regard to the new sales folks at ZEE, you answered a prior question saying that the spend is done, the initial change and now I guess you have -- I guess I\u2019m curious see how much of that is variable, might we see that pick up or will it be commiserate with production and you\u2019re obviously only giving guides to the fiscal yearend, I believe you said something like progressive improvement in each of the next two quarters, but based on Anniversarying if we look at the full calendar '17, we should see that continue to trend up in the back half of the calendar year and ideally thereafter, is that a fair assessment? Paul Adler : Yes, yes, it is. We made a larger than typical investment in the first quarter, those partners are now starting to become productive. But we will continue to add selling resources just like we always do. So it's going to be more routine over the course of the next year or so, and -- but yes, to your question. Not only do we see or we expect some improvements sequentially in the back half of this year, I would suggest that\u2019s going to continue in the first half of next fiscal year as well. Operator : Our next question comes from John Healy with Northcoast Research. John Healy : I wanted to ask just a little bit more on explanation on the ZEE Medical business and some of the deterioration in the First Aid and Safety organic growth, could you help us understand kind of what was going on with the sales force and it is now simply that Cintas sales people were trying to go in and retain the business and weren't focused on kind of growing and selling because we\u2019ve seen the organic growth come down for about three or four quarters in that business, I\u2019m just trying to understand, kind of the mechanics of what happened in the field? Mike Hansen : Sure, so we -- lets go back to, we made that deal in August of 2015 and the first thing that we needed to do was get that business on to our systems. When we\u2019re operating on their system, it hard for us to go and hire a sales rap, and put them on to their system because that would require them to sell ZEE Legacy product. And as you can imagine one of the things that we try to do is start to work our way out of the ZEE products and start to work into the Cintas products. This in ZEE\u2019s case they didn\u2019t have sales people, they have their drivers, their service sales raps or as we call them SSR\u2019s, they had their SSR\u2019s do the selling. And they didn\u2019t have a dedicated sales force, so as we brought them on the first thing we needed to do was convert them on to our system. That as we\u2019ve talked about took us really through the entire fiscal 2016 year and so as we are doing that conversation on to our system then we have to make sure that we train those SSR\u2019s on our products and services. And then we do what we\u2019ve talked about is a route optimization and that route optimization then takes those ZEE Legacy route, now that they\u2019re on our system and now we look at the whole market and we reroute the market. And that puts us in a position then to most efficiently serve the customer, and that\u2019s when we really like to then start to see the sales people start to drive revenue. And so in this case, in the case of ZEE, we didn\u2019t invest in sales people early on, because it would have required us to sell for some period of time, the ZEE product and that was something we were trying to work our way out of. So it was something that we expected and now that we are through the system integration, we are through almost all of the route optimization. We\u2019re ready to really begin aggressively selling and we should see that organic growth improve. John Healy : That\u2019s helpful, and Mike to just kind of along the same lines, when you think about the G&K acquisition, obviously they have sales people and I guess we call it SSRs as well. Is it reasonable to think that you might see organic in the laundry business, macro conditions stable, maybe do the same thing as you go through a digestion period or do you not typically see that same thing when you do it fairly good sized Uniform deal? Mike Hansen : With every deal that we do, we will expect to see some revenue reduction in the legacy business and that\u2019s true for every acquisition that we\u2019ve made and that is because a combination of things such as, there is some disruption certainly and that disruption sometimes creates the customer -- or creates the environment for the customer to look at other providers. But in addition to that, it\u2019s hard to sell; it\u2019s hard to come out of the gate selling a lot of new business, because we need to train the legacy people, the SSRs and the sales people how to sell Cintas' products, how to sell using our policies, our procedures and our tools. And so there is a natural reduction in new business sales shortly after the closing of the transaction, while we are doing training and integration. And as we get through that training and integration period we then start to expect that those resources, those legacy resources will become more and more productive. So it is just natural that we will see some pressure on sales growth in our rental business post-closing of that transaction, but the really good news is as Paul mentioned in his prepared remarks going back to Z for a second. Our gross margin dollars are up 56% over pre-acquisition dollars, and so while there is some pressure on the topline we are really creating synergy opportunities and really creating cash flow because of the synergies we're able to create. John Healy : Thank you, and just one final question, when you look at the acquisition of G&K, I know you guys had put out the 140 -- 130 million to 140 million cost savings number, but I believe that's before any sort of revaluing of the inventory and amortization of the merchandize, is there a way to think about how much of the synergies would be leaked away because of that? Mike Hansen : You know I'm not quite sure I understand the question and I would just say John, that I think we're still very comfortable with the 130 to 140. There is some work that remains to be done in an acquisition of this size, all that purchase price accounting is performed by an independent party and so there could be some movements there, but at this point in time I think we understand the economics well enough that we're still comfortable with that 130 to 140. So nothing related to your question that causes us pause at this point in time. John Healy : Right, but is that 130-140 before or after any purchase accounting associated with the merchandize that's been fully amortized that's still in the field that would get revalued higher and put on your balance sheet once the deal closes. Paul Adler : It includes our understanding our estimates based upon experience of doing deals as to what we believe that purchase price accounting to be. But as I said [multiple speakers]. Yes, we reflected it to the best of our knowledge, but as I said we don't determine that ultimately, we'll have an independent accounting firm come in and sign off on that. Operator : And next up we have Gary Bissey with RBC Capital Markets. Gary Bissey : Hey guys, just a couple of quick ones, I know it's getting late here. The -- what is the cost of the swaps or the interest rate activity you did between now and actually you getting the financing to closing the deal, should we think that interest expense changes because of these things you are doing how to prepare for taking on that debt or is that not going to be material? Mike Hansen : Generally there is not a cost and there is a true up at the time that we would do the financing. So, the answer to your question briefly we won't expect any change in our interest expenses. Gary Bissey : And then on the third quarter headwinds that you mentioned I just wanted to ask about those quickly. So the one less workday, we know the SAP have been very clear about that, the branding spend you said similar for the year, but in the second quarter, it was up year-over-year, so I guess the mix of timing within the year, it's the third quarter or is that on a year-over-year basis the branding spend likely to be more and is that something that'll be a drag on margins? Mike Hansen : Year-over-year, I think probably the third quarter is probably similar. The fourth quarter would probably be a little bit better year-over-year. But when you're thinking about our Q3 and Q4 there is still more in that Q3 then in the Q4 of fiscal '17. Gary Bissey : And then just last one on that, the energy comps, can you give us a sense how much do you think that changes from this quarter you just reported in terms of energy costs, fuel costs? Paul Adler : I think if you kind of view an annualizing of that 75 to 85 basis points for the year, I think that gets us down in the fourth quarter to probably something in the way of 40 to 50 basis points of drag. Gary Bissey : I'm sorry, I was just asking about the fuel costs. I think you said that gasoline and diesel prices were the low was the third quarter a year ago. So, [multiple speakers] materially different sequentially, February versus the November you\u2019ve just reported? Mike Hansen : I don't have the data with me by quarter, but I can tell you this, because we've already given you -- our Q1 energy was about 1.9% of revenue, Q2 was 2%. We think we'll end '17 in like the 2% to 2.2% range. So, we're expecting prices at the pump to rise. That compares to about 2% for fiscal '16. Paul Adler : But all in the second half of the year for us was about 1.8%. So, you can see we're guiding a little bit of an increase. Operator : And our final question comes from Dan Dolev with Instinet. Dan Dolev : Can you just give me a sense of the incrementals on rental on the gross margin side? I feel like it was -- the second quarter kind of broke a little bit of a trend, you were running at 63%, its maybe like in the 56% range, what should we expect sort of looking at third quarter and fourth quarter in terms of gross margin incremental in rental? Mike Hansen : I would say this Dan last -- for fiscal '16 our incremental gross margin in rental was about 58% for the year. In the second quarter it was about 56% last year. It was almost the exact same this year in the second quarter. And if you look at our incremental gross margins for the year, it's something in the way of just under 60. So I think we're continuing to have the performance that we've seen over the last year or so. Going into the second half of this year the only thing that I would say is we will be a little bit more aggressive in making sure that open positions in our rental business are filled, so that when we are ready to close the G&K transaction we're not trying to both fill our open positions and perform integration. We want to make sure that we are fully staffed as much as possible and so that's the only think I would say, it may put a little bit of pressure on that second half of the year, but generally speaking we think they will be healthy. Dan Dolev : That pressure versus the second quarter or pressure versus kind of the --? Mike Hansen : Pressure versus what we saw in the second half of last year I guess or relative to this 60% -ish. Dan Dolev : Got it, and what about the other incrementals, they was actually much healthier in First Aid, any trend to be called here? Mike Hansen : I would say that I'm not ready to give you a specific number. We've seen some really nice improvement over the last two quarters, and we expect to get back to and exceed pre-ZEE gross margins and as we grow the revenue I think we\u2019ll make progress on that, but I'm not ready to just call it out specifically yet. Dan Dolev : Got it, thanks so much. Happy holidays. Operator : And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mike Hansen for any closing comments. Mike Hansen : Well, thank you for joining us tonight. And we wish you all a wonderful holiday season. We will issue our third quarter earnings in the latter half of March. And we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you. Operator : Once again that does conclude today's call. We appreciate your participation.",

Baird Jeff Goldstein - Morgan Stanley Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Hansen : Thank you and good evening. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2017. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We are pleased to report that revenue for the third quarter, which ended February 28th was $1.281 billion, an increase of 5.3% over last year's third quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of work days was 6.5%. New business wins; penetration of existing customers with more products and services and customer retention remains strong. Organic growth for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment accelerated to a rate of 7.3%. Third quarter gross margin improved to 44.2% from 43.1% last year. As Cintas Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer stated in this afternoon's press release, this is our 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement. This and our industry leading revenue growth are indicative of a healthy company, with significant opportunities ahead. We thank our employees whom we call partners for best in class execution and results. Gross margin of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment improved to 45%, an increase of 100 basis points, compared to last year's third quarter. The First Aid and Safety segment gross margin improved to 44.8%, a year-over-year increase of 260 basis points, due to the realization of synergies from the acquisition of ZEE Medical in fiscal 2016. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the third quarter, compared to 27.3% in last year's third quarter. 50 basis points of the increase was the result of a difficult comparison due to favorable workers' comp experience in the prior year's third quarter. In addition, labor and related expenses increased as a percentage of revenue as we continue to prepare for the acquisition of G&K Services. Operating income for the third quarter of $195 million increased 0.9% from last year's third quarter. Operating income margin was 15.2%, compared to 15.9% in last year's third quarter. Third quarter operating income included $9 million or 0.7% of third quarter revenue of transaction expenses related to the previously announced agreement to acquire G&K. Excluding this G&K transaction related expense, our operating income margin was 15.9%. We're pleased with our incremental profit margins. Note that our third quarter had one less work day than last year. That's had negative impact of approximately 40 to 50 basis points on this year's operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation and amortization being determined on a monthly basis instead of a work day basis. In addition, as Paul will soon discuss in greater detail, energy had a negative impact on this year's third quarter operating margin of 50 basis points. So, to put it in perspective, excluding G&K transaction expenses, operating margin was same as last year's third quarter, despite about 100 basis points of headwinds from one less work day in energy. Net income and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the third quarter were $119 million, and $1.08 respectively. This quarter's EPS, included a positive $0.03 impact from a change in the accounting for equity compensation, as required under ASU 2016-09. Remember that this benefit shows up in the way of the lower effective tax rate, offset by higher equity compensation expense and share counts. We also had a $0.06 negative impact from expenses related to the G&K transaction, such as legal and professional expenses associated with the regulatory review. Exclusive of these items, EPS was $1.11. Yesterday, we closed on the acquisition of G&K. First and most importantly, I want to welcome our new partners from G&K. We look forward to getting to know you better and we remain very excited about this opportunity. As we have discussed, we continue to expect annual synergies in the range of $130 million to $140 million in the full year following the acquisition. We will now begin the process of integrating the two companies together. As Scott Farmer indicated in today's press release, we have pulled our revenue and EPS guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017, because we need to complete the purchase accounting process and confirm our assumption used in estimating non-recurring costs. For example, in an acquisition of this size, we are required to use a third party to value our intangibles. There can be a fairly wide range of outcomes in this type of analysis, and we won't know that outcome until the third party completes its process. Another example is that we need to record all G&K fixed assets and inventory as fair value. Much of this work is performed by a third-party firm. Again, we will not know these values until the process is completed. In the absence of this information, providing a meaningful guidance range for our fourth fiscal quarter is not possible at this time. Paul will soon provide additional details of the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Paul though, I wanted to add that we are very pleased with our third quarter results. Excluding the impact of the G&K acquisition that will come in our fourth quarter, our third quarter results keep us on pace to attain the annual guidance previously provided, and to achieve a seventh consecutive year of organic growth in the mid to high single digits with double digit growth in EPS. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Paul. Paul Adler : Thank you, Mike. First please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains one less work day than fiscal year 2016. As Mike stated, it was this quarter, the third quarter of fiscal 2017 that had one less day in the prior year quarter. One less day will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points, and operating margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. The negative impact on the fiscal 2017 third quarter was about 40 to 50 basis points of revenue growth and about 40 to 50 basis points of operating margin. Our fiscal fourth quarter contained 66 work days, the same number in the prior year fourth quarter. We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All other consist primarily of fire protection services and our direct sale business. First Aid and Safety Services, and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segments includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $993 million, an increase of 6.1% compared to last year\u2019s third quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, acquisitions and work day differences, the organic growth rate was 7.3%, compared to 6.5% last quarter. We continue to see the impact of weakness in the oil, gas and coal industry. However, as we predicted on last quarter\u2019s earnings call, the impact has lessened. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from affected customers lowered our organic growth rate by about 60 basis points in the third quarter. This compares to about a 75-basis point headwind in the previous quarter. Our Uniform Rental and Facilities Services segment gross margin was 45.0% for the third quarter, an increase of 100 basis points from 44.0% in last year\u2019s third quarter. Energy related costs were about 20 basis points higher than in last year\u2019s third quarter. In addition, job losses in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment\u2019s current year third quarter operating margin by about 30 basis points. So, on a net basis, the low price of oil had a negative impact on our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin of 50 basis points. Keep in mind that margins were also negatively impacted by one less day of revenue. Therefore, gross margin expansion of 100 basis points was achieved despite about 100 basis points of headwind from one less work day and energy. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of First Aid products, Safety Products, and Training. This segment\u2019s revenue for the third quarter was $124 million, which was 4.4% higher than last year\u2019s third quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 5.5%. Last quarter, we disclosed that we believe that the First Aid segment organic growth rate hit the bottom and the segment was positioned for improving organic growth rates. Acceleration in the organic growth rate from 3.3% in the second quarter to 5.5% this quarter was expected. Route consolidation and optimization have been completed. We previously disclosed that we added sales reps in our first quarter. ZEE Medical did not have a dedicated sales force as the business previously relied only upon SSRs to grow the business. The added sales reps will help us grow the acquired customer base through penetration with our broad range of products and services. We expect improving organic growth rates through the remainder of this fiscal year. This segment\u2019s gross margin was 44.8% in the third quarter, compared to 42.2% in last year\u2019s third quarter, an increase of 260 basis points. Our margins continue to benefit from the realization of acquisition synergies, including improved sourcing and the leveraging of existing warehouses. Our year-to-date gross margin dollars are up 51% over two years ago, and up 18% over last year. Our year-to-date gross margin percentage is almost back to pre-ZEE levels and our revenue of course is significantly greater. Our Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $163 million, an increase of 1.9% compared to last year's third quarter. The organic growth rate was 2.4%. All Other gross margin was 39.1% for the third quarter of this fiscal year, compared to 38.9% for last year's third quarter. The direct sale business by its nature is not the recurring revenue stream that our other businesses are such as Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid. Therefore, the growth rates are generally low and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multi-million-dollar account. Our Fire business however continues to grow at a consistently rapid pace. The fire business organic growth rate was just short of 10%.  As Mike stated earlier, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the third quarter compared to 27.3% in last year's third quarter. 50 basis points of the increase was the result of the difficult comparison due to favorable workers' compensation experience in the prior year third quarter. We're self-insured, which can result in some volatility from time-to-time. In addition, labor and related expenses increased as a percentage of revenue, as we continued to prepare for the acquisition of G&K. Finally, this year's third quarter includes SAP expenses amounting to about 20 basis points of revenue. Regarding SAP, since last quarter's earnings call more locations have been converted. We continue to be pleased with the conversion efforts and the capabilities of the new system. Due to the acquisition of G&K, we are planning and adjusting our SAP implementation plan as necessary.  Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter was 34.5%, compared to 33.8% for last year's third quarter. This year's third quarter rate is lower than historical rates due to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on stock compensation. Note that last year's third quarter effective tax rate benefited from the closing of a federal tax audit with favorable results. Our cash balances as of February 28, were $147 million, and we had no marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash flow from investing, or rather cash flow from operating activities in the current year quarter was $182 million, and free cash flow was about $119 million. Uses of cash in the third quarter included CapEx and payments of our regular annual dividend.  Capital expenditures for the third quarter were about $63 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows. $55 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $5 million in First Aid and Safety and $3 million in All Other. As of February 28, total debt was about $1.1 billion, consisting of $399 million in short term debt and $745 million of long-term debt. Subsequent to quarter end, debt increased about $2.3 billion to fund the acquisition of G&K. Sources of acquisition funds included the following; $100 million of G&K senior notes, $50 million of additional existing Cintas senior notes due in 2022, $1 billion of senior notes due in 2027, $650 million of senior notes due in 2022, a new term loan of $250 million and commercial paper of about $250 million. With this additional debt, we estimate that our leverage has increased to about 3.1 times debt to EBITDA. Our goal is to reduce our leverage to 2 times debt to EBITDA within three years. With $300 million of senior notes maturing in December that we will not refinance; $250 million of term loan and $250 million of commercial paper, we have structured our debt appropriately to achieve the goal. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're happy to answer your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead. Hamzah Mazari : The first question is just on customer attrition. Are you guys baking in any customer attrition post the G&K deal? Obviously, that's closed now. And any thoughts on the Uniform market potentially getting incrementally more competitive, as you work to integrate that deal? Mike Hansen : Well, Hamzah, I would say that the industry is always very competitive and it will continue to be so. As it relates to the customer attrition or retention, I don't know that I expect much of a difference there, but let me speak a little bit towards revenue; our thoughts on revenue in general. So, when we think about the Cintas business as we move forward, we have no expectations for change. We continue to expect growth in that mid-to-high single-digits. When we think about the G&K revenue though, you can think about it in terms of there's a new business component, there is the kind of customer penetration, and there's a lost business or attrition component, in the normal course of doing business. And as we move forward, we're going to continue to have that customer attrition that we've seen in -- that G&K has seen historically, and that we'll likely see continue into the future. There will likely be a little bit of an increase due to disruption of the integration, but generally speaking I would say not a lot of change. The difference though will be the new business component. So as you can kind of think about new business and the G&K sales team over the course of the last seven months, they have been trying to sell in an environment where selling a five-year contract under kind of an uncertain future is, as you could imagine is quite difficult. So the new business component certainly has been pressured quite a bit over the last seven months. As we move into now the post-closing process, that momentum carries into our post-closing process. In addition, as we think about their sales people, you can imagine that the difficulty in selling new business and contractual new business in the environment resulted in some attrition. And so as we move forward, we will need to hire new people to replace some of those sales people, but also train all of their sales people as we move forward. So training them on selling our products and services, training them on our systems, using our processes et cetera and there certainly will be a productivity -- a negative productivity impact. So as we look forward, we will continue to probably see the normal customer attrition that the business has seen, maybe a little bit higher. But we will also see some significant pressures on the new business. And so as we think about that moving forward, our experience has been for years and years that we will see some pressure to the point where we may see revenue come down in the 5% to 10% range over the course of the next year or so. Hamzah Mazari : That\u2019s extremely helpful. And just a follow up question. Are there any divestitures build into your cost synergy target number of 130 to 140 or is that something you are working through right now? Mike Hansen : There were no divestitures baked into that assumption. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Bissey with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jay Hanna : Hi, this is actually Jay Hanna on for Garry today. I was wondering if you guys could give a little more detailed look at what the pace of those cost synergies will be? And maybe a more detailed timeline for the full integration of G&K within Cintas as well? Mike Hansen : Well, as you probably have seen, we talked about $130 million to $140 million in annual synergies, fully realized in year four. We have also talked about this being fully accretive or accretive in our second full year. That would be our fiscal '19. As we move forward, we certainly have had a lot of assumptions about those synergies, but I will tell you over the course of the last seven months, one thing that I need to make sure is clear, is we have been operating as two separate companies, and that was a requirement, so that we were not jumping ahead of the regulatory process. And I tell you that because we are just now -- we just closed yesterday. We are just now getting into the confirming of our assumptions, and we need to do that before we can provide more timing, more specific timing on the synergies. But we do feel like we will be accretive in year two, and in year one we are going to have some onetime expenses that are non-recurring in nature; things like rebranding, asset impairments, severance, lease breakage type thing and we're going to be going to work over the course of the next several months, really confirming what those amounts will be. Once we do that, once we confirm our assumptions for the integration plan, we'll have a better idea of what fiscal '18 will look like and our expectation would be we certainly share that in July. But having said all of that, we certainly do think that there will be synergies in year one. We\u2019re just not ready to provide any specific numbers. Jay Hanna : Great. And then excluding the acquisition and following in this quarter, you spoke to it a little bit earlier. But do you think full year \u201917 guidance, would it remain the same or possibly increase following third quarter? Mike Hansen : I would say that we would likely have either left them the same or possibly narrowed by bringing the bottoms up a little bit. So third quarter, we are very pleased with the third quarter. I think we\u2019ve got some nice momentum and execution going on in the business and we are poised to have a good fourth quarter. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Joe Box with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Joe Box : Yes. Hey guys. So I was hoping to dig into the 80 basis points sequential pick-up in organic growth for Uniform. Looks like there was about 15 basis points sequential tailwind from less oil and gas drag. So can you maybe put a little bit more color on the non-oil and gas improvement, really just aside from calling out ancillary products and better customer retention? Paul Adler : Yes. Joe, it\u2019s Paul. You are right, the 15 basis points is part of the math. I would say in addition to that, we had a very good strong quarter from a new business perspective, especially as it related to garments. And so not only do you benefit from the new business in terms of that additional recurring revenue, that you will receive from the garments going forward over these five-year agreements, but we have new business installed related to garments. You also have some good revenue in terms of peripheral charges, incentive fees and emblem costs. So that definitely helped as well. But really outside of that Joe, there was nothing extraordinary. It\u2019s just the continuation of execution that the game plan, quality service, retention remained strong, a very strong organic revenue growth quarter, something we\u2019re proud of, given all the excitement of the pending acquisition. But just continuation of what we\u2019ve done the last six years of growing top-line and that 5% to 7% organically, and again proud of those growth rates compared to the competition, which has been posting much, much smaller organic growth rates. Joe Box : I appreciate it Paul. And then just a question on guidance. I guess, I\u2019m just curious, why not provide a non-cash goal post here. So purchase accounting is really kind of the biggest unknown. And then I guess just from an expectation standpoint, should we think about maybe an inter-quarter 8-K with guidance, once you guys get the third-party valuations done or should we be thinking about this as being maybe a more 4Q call type item? Mike Hansen : As a relates to why not provide some sort of guidance, whether it\u2019s cash or something else. Joe, we\u2019re going to get busy right away and we\u2019re going to get busy on the integration items. And as we do that, the businesses blur. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to go through the next two and slightly over two months and have two distinct businesses still by the end. They are going to get blurred, because we\u2019re bringing them together and we\u2019re going to be doing quite a bit of integration work. And it just -- it becomes very, very difficult to keep those pieces separate. And because of that we're not -- I don\u2019t like the idea of trying to dissect that. If we do come up with the purchase accounting results during the quarter and we feel that we're in a position to provide them, you may see us do that, but our first goal is to really understand it and get it right and then provide. Joe Box : Understood, and I do appreciate that the lines will get blurred here, but I assume that the fiscal year 4Q revenue guidance for standalone Cintas probably is still generally intact. Is that fair? Mike Hansen : As we've talked about, yes. We think that's fair and it probably -- we would probably have narrowed it by bringing the bottom up. We feel good about the fourth quarter and the third quarter I think is very indicative of the second half of the year that we expected to have. So yes, the answer to your question is yes. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman : Hi, would you be willing to talk how long you think the amortization period will be. And in year one if it wasn't for the amortization, would the merger be accretive? Mike Hansen : The amortization period will be 10 years most likely. We expect that to be in the range of about 3% to 4% of the deal value. And would it be accretive without that? I think yes. I think the answer Andrew is yes, that you can kind a think about that as a what, $66 million to $88 million annual number. It will be fairly a large non-cash number. Operator : Our next question comes from Minaz Putnik with Barclays. Minaz Putnik : Thank you, good evening gentlemen, and firstly congratulations on getting the deal done. So I appreciate -- I think why you I guess retracted the guidance to '17. And just to your point on calling out that amortization as a non-cash number in Q4. Going forward when you guys do initiate '18 guidance, will you be -- if not giving sort of the cash EPS number at least call out all these non-cash charges pretty clearly for us to calculate that? Mike Hansen : That will be our goal yes. We will likely provide GAAP guidance but we will -- our goal will be to give you some of these large items to give you a sense of what the performance detail will look like. Minaz Putnik : Okay that would be very helpful. And then just on the organic performance, another strong quarter obviously. Just like how you describe the three components for G&K in terms of new business penetration and retention, or attrition, can you just help lay that out in terms of where the growth is coming for Cintas standalone right now? Paul Adler : Definitely new businesses continue to be the strongest driver of the growth. As we've said it, new business in terms of new customers; we're still selling that 60/40 split of 60% of the new business wins, our new programmers versus the 40% taking market share. So that's been very consistent through this year and really in the near past as well. New business also includes the penetration of our existing customers. That is certainly part of our vision and that continues at a very good pace. A lot of the hygiene products that we've talked about in the past, our Sanis signature series, new offering in the last couple of years, that's really helped us with penetration. Retention has been roughly 95%. So still strong, no significant change in that. So, really no significant movement in any of the key component of organic growth drivers. Minaz Putnik : And that 40% share gain you talked about, does that typically end up being from the smaller regional players or do they -- or is it a broad mix with the national players as well? Mike Hansen : No, it's a broad mix of wins versus small, medium, large competitors. Operator : Our next question comes from George Tong with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Adrian Paz : Hi this is Adrian Paz calling for George. I just have question on the G&K transaction. Can you provide -- on the synergies, can you provide the breakdown of what's going to be revenue synergies versus what's going to be synergies? Mike Hansen : We have not included any revenue synergies in that $130 million to $140 million. Those are cost synergies and they come in four primary buckets and in no particular order. We think of them in terms of material cost. So, a sourcing benefit. We think of them in terms of production improvements. So, the more efficient use of capacity. We think of them in terms of the route density allowing us to use less fuel because of more dense routes. And then we think about it in terms of overhead and the reduction of duplicate overhead. Did not include any revenue synergies in that amount. And one of the reasons we didn\u2019t is because we need to get through the integration work. We need to get them on to our systems. We need to optimize the routes and we need to have our new G&K partners really trained and comfortable in selling our product line, and that takes a little bit of time. Adrian Paz : And on the -- so with the SAP implementation, do you expect your cost savings from the SAP platform to be bigger within the G&K transaction or are your estimates since then? Mike Hansen : We do expect the benefit to be bigger. We are -- first of all the additional revenue certainly provides better leverage over the system. But certainly, operating on one system in total certainly will create additional benefits for us. And the better visibility into all of our new customers will certainly help us in terms of identifying cross seller penetration opportunities, identifying where certain industries we are -- customers in certain industries where we believe we have got a good product mix to provide value, but certain customers in that industry don\u2019t have some of those. We think there is a lot of opportunity, and certainly by adding the G&K volume, that certainly helps it out. Paul Adler : And to add to that. More benefits and then really not a lot of significant additional costs; that's the beauty of the acquisition. Just another positive is that we get to leverage G&K over that existing $140 million spend. So, we'll have some have additional licensing costs, nominal amount but the capital investment is not going to increase. Adrian Paz : And if I could just ask one more, on the non-programming market or the no-programmer market, how do you think about that market and how much growth you believe is available there and do those declines have the margin profile as your existing clients? Mike Hansen : We think there is a lot of runway there. As Paul said about two thirds of our new business comes from that no-programmer segment, and it's been that way for a long time. The -- we have talked a little bit about what that no-programmer may look like. It could be outdoor trades, people that are now renting our Carhartt products. It could be culinary people now renting our Chef Works product, it could be healthcare workers now renting our scrub rental programs. There are lots of opportunities there and there will continue to be. The margin profile is I would say is not significantly different from any other type of account, but certainly we know that with all of our customers the more penetration that we can take -- that we can have, the product and services that we can add to them, the more valuable those stocks become. Usually the lesser the probability that they leave us because we are more fully penetrated. So once we sell any account, penetration becomes really important afterwards. Operator : And our next question comes from Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Justin Hauke : I just wanted to talk a little bit more about maybe how does think about revenue synergies, and I guess the reason why I ask is obviously you guys have been very successful in broadening out services that you offered. You are acquiring 170,000 customers here. Is there a difference, and maybe you can give us the number of average services you sell to your current customers and how that compared to G&K so we can kind of think about what the incremental opportunity to sell into that base is? And I guess related to that also would be, is there any material difference in the 95% retention rate that you have and the retention rate that maybe you are acquiring here? Mike Hansen : I would -- so first of all, I don\u2019t know the penetration of G&K. Again, we haven\u2019t had visibility and insight until really starting today, and we\u2019ll start to learn that more and more. So it\u2019s hard for me to try to estimate what any revenue penetration might be. We have told -- we have talked a lot about, if you think about our Uniform Rental customers for example, the highest penetrated item is our mats, entrance mats. And I would say about 60% of our Uniform Rental customers have entrance mats. That doesn\u2019t mean they have as many as we believe that they should we have, but it means they have at least some presence in the entrance mat. In addition to that, all of our other products are less than 20% penetrated. So we have a lot of runway on our own and I would suspect that G&K\u2019s profile is from a Uniform Rental and match, is probably not a lot different than ours, although that is purely a guess. And I would say that the broader line for us likely in the hygiene and the chemical cleaning First Aid and Safety Fire Protection, those become nice opportunities. I don\u2019t have any kind of information as far as qualifying that, because we just don\u2019t know enough about those customers. And an example would be, I want to see, or we would want to see the profile of the G&K customers. And that\u2019s when we start to analyze or look for the opportunities in terms of what are the products and services we can provide to that. So we need some time to be able to do that. As it relates to your second question of retention, again don\u2019t have specifics on that, but I would say that they are probably not two different from ours. Although, I would suggest that because our growth rate is so much higher than the industry in general, that our retention is likely a little bit better. Justin Hauke : Okay, great. No, I understand it\u2019s still early. So that\u2019s fair, and we\u2019ll look forward to learning more about it, as you learn more about it. I guess just two more mechanical questions into modeling purposes. First, are you planning on reporting all of G&K in the rental segment or should we think that some of it goes in the other business? And how much of it would go there? And then second, the SAP cost that you previously outlined, the 40 million to 45 million for 2018, how should we think about that number, now that you\u2019re bringing in G&K? Is that still the right number or does it have to be larger than that? Mike Hansen : So your first question is, yes. I would say almost all of that revenue and operating income would fall into the rental segment. As it relates to the second question, we will give some thoughts on SAP, when we provide our guidance in July. But I would suggest that it\u2019s going to be lower than 40 to 45 for -- probably because, we\u2019ve seen that we\u2019ve been a little bit more efficient this year than we expected. And the additional -- any additional costs related to an integration of G&K will come in the way of length and integration or implementation process. So I wouldn't expect that it drives up our costs in fiscal '18. I would just -- I think we talked a little bit about it drives the implementation process into fiscal '19. So we'll see a little bit of -- a little bit more expense in '19 than we initially expected, because of the duration with G&K. But again, the process has been going well and we've been spending less than we expected, and I would expect that results in lower numbers for '18. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Jeff Goldstein : Hey this is actually Jeff Goldstein on for Toni. I wanted to piggyback a little bit on an earlier question. One of your primary competitors called out industry weakness in the most recently completed quarter. Can you just comment on what you're seeing in the marketplace, why you think you continue to have more; and if you've seen any type of irrational behavior among competitors, maybe in anticipation of your merger with G&K. Mike Hansen : I would say from a -- what are we seeing differently. From an economic standpoint, I would say that our third quarter from an economy standpoint didn't really feel any different than our first two quarters of this fiscal year, other than there has been a lot of sentiment about maybe the new administration being a little bit more pro-business et cetera. But I would say I'm not sure that's translated much into what we've seen on the street. Having said that it's been a constructive environment, and with the exception of the oil and gas vertical, which we've in fact seen get a little bit better, we haven't seen much of a change one way or the other. And because of that, as you've seen, we've continued to execute well and continued at maybe organic growth levels of the first half of the year and in fact even a little bit better. And I think that is simply as Paul mentioned good execution, good new business productivity. Our sales people are doing a great job.  As it relates to your second question of are we seeing any irrational behavior, I would just say that it's always very competitive. Once we get into the to talk more of our G&K partners, we may find that it's -- it was a probably a little bit more aggressive on G&K customers. But we certainly know when an acquisition is announced the competition gets very aggressive around the acquired customers. And I would say that's kind part for the course. Jeff Goldstein : Okay. And then can you just provide a little more color on the sequential decline in First Aid margins and what the big driver of that beyond just the one fewer workday? And then just longer term, do you think the First Aid segment could ever close the margin gap with rental or do you see kind of structural differences in those businesses of that. Paul Adler : Yes Jeff, First Aid we were pleased with the results overall. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, we felt like last quarter that we had hit a bottom, and that became reality and then we expect those organic growth rates to continue to climb. That business should grow in the high single-digits. That's what it grew coming into ZEE, and that's what we expect going forward. In terms of the margins though, we're -- the gross margins continue to improve. We mentioned in the prepared remarks, how much the dollars are up over couple of years, 50 some odd percent, 18% year-over-year increase in gross margin dollars. The incremental gross margins have been very strong. Last year they were in the 30% range. This year last two quarters they were 100%. So gross margins are moving along as we expected, as we continue to realize those synergies. SG&A we do have a little bit of heavier investment in the selling part of that component. As we mentioned in our first quarter we invested in the sales force to be able to grow that acquired big block of ZEE business. And they've only been there what, a quarter or two at most. They'll continue to become more productive; they'll grow that top line, we'll get that leverage and so we are optimistic about not only the top line growth but the margin improvement going forward. Mike Hansen : I think Jeff, as Paul mentioned, we've made an investment in our sales team there. ZEE did not have a sales team and so we've -- as we came out of the system conversion, it was time to start really selling in a little bit more -- well, in higher volumes and that's what we did. We invested to be able to do that. Do we have the confidence that those margins can get into those mid to high teens? We certainly do and if you go back to our fiscal '15 results, we were at about 13.8 for the year of fiscal '15, but the last three quarters all exceeded 14%. And with the addition of the ZEE business, that certainly is going to benefit us long term and we really like the business. It's doing exactly what we would expect that it should do, and those margins will continue to improve. Operator : It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Hansen I'd like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. Mike Hansen : Well thank you for joining us tonight. We'll issue our fourth quarter earnings in mid-July and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Good night. Operator : And that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Hansen : Thank you and good evening. With me tonight is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2017. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We are pleased to report that revenue for the fourth quarter, which ended May 31st was $1.530 billion, an increase of 23.1% over last year's fourth quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 8.1%. New business wins; penetration of existing customers with more products and services and customer retention remains strong. The organic growth for the uniform rental and facility services segment 8%. And the organic growth rate of the first aid and safety services segment was 9.2%. Fourth quarter gross margin improved to 44.4% from 43.9% last year. This is our 15th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement. Operating income for the fourth quarter of $177.3 million decreased 11.2% from last year's fourth quarter. Fiscal 2017 fourth quarter operating income was negatively impacted by $63.7 million of transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K Services acquisition. Excluding G&K results and acquisition charges as well as a benefit from a change in the accounting for equity compensation as required by a recent accounting standard, our operating income margin was 16.4% versus 16.1% last year, an improvement of 30 basis points. Net income and earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal '17 were $82.2 million and $0.75 respectively. Fiscal '17 fourth quarter EPS included a positive impact of $0.02 from the change in the accounting for equity compensation and $0.05 from the G&K business. Fiscal '17 fourth quarter EPS included a negative impact of $0.50 from transaction and integration expenses and certain incremental nonrecurring bank fees included in the interest expense related to the G&K acquaint. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.18 versus $1.06 last year and 11% increase over last year's fourth quarter. Our fiscal 2017 results added to our record of success. We have now grown revenue and profit 46 of the past 48 years, with the only exception being the great recession years. For the seventh consecutive year, organic growth was in the mid-to-high single digits. We continue to grow by multiples in excess of both gross domestic product and employment. For the seventh consecutive year, we grew EPS double digits excluding the G&K results and acquisition related items as well as the benefit from ASU 2016-09. And we increased the annual dividend for the 33rd consecutive year. For Cintas the past is indicative of the future because of the constant we share, which is our culture. Our culture is part of our strategy and drives our meaningful performance. We value honesty and integrity, competitive urgency, and challenging the status quo in a positive manner. Profitable growth is in our DNA. The opportunities for us to seize are significant. Retail inspired garments, health care scrub rental, and branded rental garments like Carhartt, our recent investments in the product line which have a long runway. Our first aid and safety business has a run rate of more than $500 million and yet we just recently completed our national footprint. National account opportunities also remain. And despite acquiring a significant competitor, new business wins were up significantly over last year. Also our fire services business is only about 70 of the top 100 largest markets in North America. We continue to evolve as a business services company helping over a million customers get ready for the workday. With an array of products and services including dust mask, hygiene products, first aid products and services, and fire protection services, we have a product or service for every business in North America. Our opportunity for continued growth is the 16 million businesses we currently don't do business with. Not only the opportunity is significant to expand market share, but we have huge potential to grow revenue and profit by penetrating our existing customer base. Within our uniform wearing customer base, our penetration rates of other products and services with the exception of entrance mats are less than 20% and less than 10% of our customers do business with two or more of our business units. We've added sales reps specifically focused on penetrating existing customers. They're supported by a national branding campaign whose purpose is to educate on all that we can do for businesses so they can concentrate on their core competencies. Cintas is a business that was built to last and that building doesn't stop. Our focus on the long term means that we make the needed investments. Our investment in an enterprise resource planning system is a significant one. The implementation of SAP will continue into fiscal year 2020 due to the additional operations from the G&K acquisition. Once completed, SAP will produce cost savings and will better equip us to cross sell. We will be a stronger company with this new technology. And finally, we are excited about our recent acquisition of G&K. Preliminary results are very encouraging. We are on track to meet our financial and nonfinancial objectives and look forward to the many opportunities G&K provides. The synergies are compelling and result from the significant overlap in operations. Route density will also improve. We can spend more time helping customers solve their problems. We will have more time to sell into the accounts. The cost synergies alone will improve G&K operating margins to about 25% in four years. So in sum, our record of success is a lengthy one. The past has been great, but the future too is very bright. So looking ahead to 2018, we expect revenue to be in the range of $6.27 billion to $6.36 billion and fiscal '18 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.15 to $5.25. Our guidance includes the following assumptions related to the acquired G&K business. No transaction and integration expenses. Revenue of $870 million to $900 million compared to a prior year run rate of $965 million. Synergies of approximately $50 million to $55 million. Purchase price amortization expense related to intangible assets of $50 million. Interest expense on G&K acquisition debt of about $65 million and an EPS contribution of $0.15 to $0.17. Again this EPS guidance does not include any G&K transaction and integration expenses. However, we do expect to incur these expenses in fiscal '18 as we continue to integrate the acquisition. We estimate that these expenses will range from $50 million to $65 million. Before I turn the call over to Paul, I want to discuss the G&K revenue guidance, we've discussed this over the course of the last year, but want to be clear. Obviously the two most significant components of revenue growth rate are new business and lost business. The legacy G&K operations just like Cintas operations will continue to have loss business in the normal course as contracts come up for renewal. The G&K loss business may be slightly higher than normal due to the disruption of the integration, but not significantly so. The new business component from the legacy G&K sales reps though will significantly decrease for a temporary period. We are in a process of filling open positions and training all new reps on how to sell using the Cintas processes, how to sell Cintas products and services and to use the Cintas systems. As a result, the new business typically generated to offset the normal loss business will temporarily be reduced until the sales reps get back to their territories and begin to ramp productivity to normal levels. The result is that legacy G&K revenue will decline in fiscal '18. This was expected and we modeled the deal based upon this reality. So now I'll turn the call over to Paul. Paul Adler : Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 continued one less work day than in fiscal year 2016. It was the third quarter that had one less day than the prior year quarter. One less workday negatively impacted fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 basis points and operating margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. Looking ahead to fiscal '18, there will be no differences in workdays as fiscal '18 contains the same number of work days per quarter as fiscal '17. We have two reportable operating segments, uniform rental and facility services, and first date and safety services. The remainder of our business is included in all other. All other consist of fire protection services and our direct sale business. First aid and safety services and all other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement. The uniform rental and facility services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogues to our customers on route. Uniform rental and facility services revenue was $1.220 billion, an increase of 27.1% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 8%. Our uniform rental and facility services segment gross margin was 44.6% for the fourth quarter, an increase of 20 basis points from 44.4% in last year's fourth quarter. Current year fourth quarter gross margin of course included the margin on the acquired G&K business, which was 40.2% for the fourth quarter. Excluding the acquired G&K business, the Cintas legacy uniform rental and facility services business gross margin improved 100 basis points from 44.4% to 45.4%. The G&K gross margin will improve to Cintas legacy levels as we realize the synergies from the acquisition. For instance, one of the factors resulting in a currently lower G&K gross margin is that energy expense as a percent of revenue is 80 basis points higher than the Cintas legacy business. This is the result of the smaller G&K business lacking the route density that the larger Cintas legacy business possesses. The fuel savings from route density along with the benefit of reducing redundant capacity will drive significant improvements in G&K gross margin. Our first aid and safety services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $134 million, which was 9.4% higher than last year's fourth quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 9.2%. I want to take some time to revisit the impact of the ZEE Medical business on this segment's organic growth rate. We acquired ZEE in our first quarter of fiscal 2016. ZEE was a significant acquisition, increasing the total first aid business by about one-third. In our fiscal 2017 second quarter, 15 months after the acquisition, this segment's organic growth rate was less than the typical high-single digits. This lower organic growth rate was due to two main reasons. First, not only was the acquired ZEE business significant in size, but it was also not growing. The ZEE Medical pre-acquisition had no sales force. Second, our focus in the first year of an acquisition is to secure the customer base and earn the trust of the acquired customers through outstanding service. On our second quarter earnings call of this fiscal year, we disclosed that we believe that the first aid segment's organic growth rate hit the bottom and the segment was positioned for improving organic growth rates. We added sales reps to grow the ZEE customer base with our broad range of products and services. And meanwhile, the legacy Cintas first aid and safety business continued to grow at a strong pace. As we expected, our organic growth rate did climb from the bottom, increasing from 3.3% in the second quarter to 5.5% in the third quarter and now 9.2% in the fourth quarter. Thus the decline in the organic growth rate was expected due to the weight of the acquired business and it was temporary. The segment has returned to its customary organic growth rates in the high single digits and on a significantly larger revenue base. This segment's gross margin was 44.5% in the fourth quarter compared to 42.9% in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 160 basis points. Our margins continue to benefit from the realization of ZEE acquisition synergies, including improved sourcing and the leveraging of the existing warehouses. Our fire protection services and direct sale businesses are reported in the all other category. All other revenue was $175 million, an increase of 9.2% compared to last year's fourth quarter. The organic growth rate was 8.3%. All other gross margin was 42.8% for the fourth quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42% for last year's four quarter. The direct sale business by its nature is not the recurring revenue stream that our other businesses are. Therefore the growth rates are generally low-single digits and are subject to volatility such as when we install a multi-million dollar account. We installed some large accounts in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 driving double-digit organic growth in this business. One of these accounts was Southwest Airlines. Majority of the product was shipped and recognized as revenue at the end of fiscal 2017 as opposed to early fiscal 2018 as originally expected. On July 11 2017, we sold a business that was not a good strategic fit. The business was reported as discontinued operations for the periods ended May 31st 2017 and 2016. Revenue and EPS for the sold business were about $26 million and $0.01 respectively in Q4 of fiscal 2017 and $28 million and $0.02 respectively in Q4 of fiscal 2016. Revenue and EPS for the business were about $105 million and $0.07 respectively for the full fiscal year of 2017 and $110 million and $0.07 respectively for the full fiscal year of 2016. These amounts are important to remember as you consider our fiscal 2018 guidance. Proceeds from the sale, net of taxes paid will be approximately $85 million. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.6% in the fourth quarter compared to 27.9% in last year's fourth quarter. 60 of the 70 basis points is attributable to the amortization expense of the intangible assets established in the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter was 37.8% compared to 37.2% for last year's fourth quarter. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on tax reserve build and releases relating to discrete items. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 to be about 34%. Our cash equivalents balance as of May 31 was $169 million and we had $22 million of marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash flow from operating activities on the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter was $280 million dollars and free cash flow was $225 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were approximately $55 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows; $45 million in uniform rental and facility services, $7 million in first aid and safety, and $3 million in all other. We expect fiscal year 2018 CapEx be in the range of $280 million to $320 million. As of May 31st total debt was about $3.133 billion consisting of $363 million in short-term debt and $2.770 billion of long-term debt. Our leverage at May 31st was 2.8 times debt to EBITDA. Subsequent to May 31, we repaid $50 million of the term loan. We expect our leverage ratio to decrease to approximately 2.3 debt to EBITDA at May 31st 2018. With $300 million of senior notes maturing in December that we will not refinance, $200 million of term loan and commercial paper, we have structured our debt to help us achieve our goal of reducing leverage to 2.0 times debt to EBITDA. Regarding SAP, since last quarter's earnings call, more locations have been converted to the system. As of the end of this month, we will have converted about 30 locations. We continue to be pleased with the conversion efforts and the capabilities of the new system. Due to the acquisition of G&K, we are adjusting our SAP implementation plan as necessary. Certain G&K acquisition locations will also be converted to SAP. And therefore because of this additional work we expect the implementation to extend through fiscal 2020. The good news is that we can leverage the system over an even larger organization because the SAP hardware and software costs will not increase. They are sunk costs. We expect that fiscal 2018 SAP expenses will amount to approximately $30 million. This compares to about $12 million in fiscal 2017. That concludes our prepared remarks, we are happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead. Manav Patnaik : Thank you good evening gentlemen. First question for you is just on the divestiture, maybe just a little bit more color on which part of the old business that was in and just why that was done? Paul Adler : Manav, this is Paul. That business as you can tell from the numbers that we quoted was small in the scheme of things. It was really the combination of a couple of acquisitions that we had made years ago. It was an emergency services type business that provided emergency like plumbing and electrical work security door work, commercial cleaning, services of that nature. The difference was that that work though was performed by sub-contractors and so it's a model we kind of experimented with, but ultimately we decided that we wanted to self-perform service as part of our differentiation from our competition. And so therefore it was not a good strategic fit for us. Manav Patnaik : And would that revenue fall into the all other line, is that where that would have fit? Paul Adler : Yes. Primarily in the previous periods, it was in the all other bucket. Mike Hansen : There was a small piece in the rental segment, but mostly in all other. Manav Patnaik : And then just on the synergy side, you've laid out the cost synergies for the year and you've given us the guidance on this before, maybe just on the revenue synergies, any sense on when we should start expecting more color on that and any examples of how we should think of the revenue opportunity here? Mike Hansen : Our first goal is to, as Paul talked about kind of on board our new customers, make sure that they understand our services and we expect that the primary integration activities will happen in the first two years. I think once we are then on the same systems and they are all of those locations, those new locations are trained on our products and services, I think will then start to see the opportunities. So my expectation would be that's a 2020 type of a conversation. Manav Patnaik : Sorry, just last one, just to clarify. You said most of these synergies in the first two years, is that different from what you said before in terms of getting 130 to 140 over three to four years? Mike Hansen : Manav, I said the most of the integration activities would occur in the first two years, that is different from the recognition of the synergies. So let me maybe talk a little bit about the synergies real quickly. We spent the fourth quarter really confirming our assumptions with our integration plan. And the good news is we did not see anything that changed our mind about our opportunity. No unforeseen issues, we still expect that it we'll achieve $130 million to $140 million in synergies. So that's I think that was one step and that's a good start for us. We didn't do many integration activities in the fourth quarter because of the confirming and really spending time communicating with our new partners and our new customers. However we've gotten pretty busy in June and July. And in June, we did convert the G&K payroll to our payroll system that's a big first step and that went very well. We have converted to the Cintas financial system that's another big step that went well and we've gone through the first few waves of branch consolidations and those have gone well. And so I think we're off to a good start. No surprises as of yet and we really like what we've seen so far. We mentioned that the year one synergies are $50 million to $55 million and let me step back and say, we did announce that we were closing the corporate headquarters and that closure is proceeding. And so certainly the year one synergies are certainly coming some from the corporate closure and other G&A activities, probably more than half of those first year synergies. And the rest are from the integration activities of the integration of locations. Again, we think that most of those integration activities are going to happen in the first two years. The synergy recognition though generally will happen in the 12 months following that integration activity. So in year one we're going to see 50 to 55, in year two, I think we'll see another meaningful increase in synergies, and in year three, we'll see the annualizing of the year two synergy. I'm sorry the year two integration activities. We'll also start to see some sourcing benefits in that third year and we expect to fully realize the 130 to 140 in year four. So that's a little bit of the cadence of the synergy recognition and let's just - it's a little bit of a nuance but the integration activities are a little bit different than the synergy recognition. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird. Andrew Wittmann : I wanted to build on that last one and to see if I could drill in a little bit more. So that you've got the synergy plan and integration plan pretty well mapped out for this year. I was wondering Mike, if you just give us a little bit of inside as what do you think you'll be ending the fiscal year at for like a run rate, just given the visibility that you have so far? Mike Hansen : And are you saying a synergy run rate? Andrew Wittmann : Yeah. You're going to recognize a 50 here and I was just wondering at the end of the year what do you think the annualized run rate will be at the end of the fiscal year? Mike Hansen : I would - I'm hesitate to provide that because I want to see a little bit more, but I think it will probably be a run rate to about half of our total synergy number. And we'll start to see as we then get more integration activities, we'll start to get pretty close on a run rate perspective by the end of that second year. But I'm a little hesitant to give you a specific number because I want to see a little bit more of the waves happen. Andrew Wittmann : Yeah that's fair. I want to drill into the guidance a little bit and just make sure that my understanding matches your understanding of it. In particular on the organic growth implication there, obviously you've got some moving pieces with not only G&K, but this disposition as well. I calculate something at seven or a little bit north of seven kind of being the organic growth rate implied in your guidance. Do you get to the math and can you help us understand maybe how that breaks down by segment? Mike Hansen : Andy, I get a little bit less than that. Our last few years we've been in the kind of the 5% to 6.5% range and that's about where we are this year as well. I'm not going to get into that by segment, but I would say, we're in the same range we've been the last few years in terms of our opening guidance. Andrew Wittmann : Maybe my final question was been on the margins. And I think if you did - if you give the numbers for rental segments, gross margins like-for-like or legacy Cintas, up 100 basis points. I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit of help on breaking that down, where you got that and how those puts and takes are trending now as we move forward here into the new year. Mike Hansen : I think that revenue, I'm sorry, the gross margin improvement is building on the same thing that we've seen over the course of the last few years. And that is continued leveraging of our infrastructure, penetrating existing customers, selling revenue that is not processed in our laundry facilities such that we get more revenue dollars out of our existing capacity. I would say those are the keys to that gross margin improvement. And we think that with the improving G&K gross margins over the course of certainly the next couple years, we think we still have some good run rate there. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mario Cortellacci with Macquarie. Mario Cortellacci : Could you give us a sense of how much of your business is levered to employment trends or job figures versus history? It appears the business is a little more diverse, both within the uniform and also first aid and fire safety. Wondered if you could give us a little color? Mike Hansen : Maybe I'll say that this way. Our revenue is roughly half uniform and then I'll move maybe into our rental segment, about half of the rental segment is non-uniform, so facility services made up of entrance mats, hygiene products, chemical cleaning solutions et cetera. So, today compared to let's call it ten years ago, the percentage of uniform revenue is certainly lower than then, it was probably closer to the 60%, 70% range back then. The other thing I would say is, is we have worked hard not just to create solutions that are non-uniform, but also within our uniform programs we worked hard to create innovative products retail and inspire products, garments solution based products that can reach new and different customers even in a time when there is not employment growth. So in other words we think there is a large unserved opportunity out there and we have products and services I would say today that are better able to capture that unserved market than maybe ten years ago. And so when we look back over the last seven years or so, and I think we talked about our revenue growth being multiples of GDP and employment. A lot of it is because of the innovative garments that people want to wear. As well as then the non-garment solutions that we've created that really can create value for every type of business in America. So we feel good about that little bit of that decoupling from the employment that may be ride us a little bit closer ten years ago. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Gary Bisbee : Hi guys, congratulations on closing the deal and it sounds like you're off to a real good start. I guess the first question I have you showed another quarter of sequential acceleration in the rental's organic revenue growth. What do you attribute that to - last quarter, you said that one of the factors that's been changing is you're doing great job on retention. Is that still it and I wanted to ask directly, how much business have you taken from G&K in this interim period from when you announced the deal to closing it, because it seems no one else in the industry is seeing acceleration, you are and there's a falling off. So I wonder if it's just the transfer from acquired to organic a piece of that? Mike Hansen : It is not a piece of that, so we would not - when we convert revenue from, let's call it, that legacy system to our system, that certainly is not organic growth to us. So why the acceleration in organic growth? I think it is because we continue to execute at very high levels, I think we got a little bit of benefit in this fourth quarter, not I think - I know we got a little bit of benefit in the fourth quarter from a bit of a bounce back in - or a lessening of the negative in the oil and gas area. Last year, when we talked about fourth quarter performance, we had said that the headwind in oil and gas was about 100 basis points. This year, we would have said, I think in the third quarter, we said 60 basis point headwind. We would say it's probably more like 30. And so the year-over-year comps in the oil and gas are starting to be beneficial. That won't last forever, but starting to be beneficial. So I think we got a little bit of bounce from that. But most of it is, you know, we continue to execute well. Our reps are very productive and customer retention remains good. Gary Bisbee : Yeah. And I did mean to imply, you were doing something funky with the accounting. I just wondered if your sales people were targeting G&K customers and if you have a sense for if you won business, where people switched to you rather than dealing with whatever happened there, maybe you just don't have a sense for it, but? Mike Hansen : Well, I mean, if you're talking post acquisition, we certainly wouldn't go and - Gary Bisbee : I am talking from when you announced the deal in August until you closed, right, there is this period we said their sales productivity fell off, your revenue accelerated. And so I just wondered if you had any sense if your reps were going to those customers and saying, \u201cHey, you're going to be with us sooner or later, do you want to switch now and have some certainty around pricing coverage, you know, et cetera?\u201d Mike Hansen : I apologize, I didn't catch that you had mentioned since the signing. I don't think that's - I don't think that's any part of the organic growth. Gary Bisbee : Okay. Fair enough. And then just is there any of their revenue going into the other line, did they have some uniform sales or is it pretty much all in rental? Mike Hansen : Correct. It's all in the rental segment. Yes. But there was a very, very small piece in the first aid business, I mean we're talking about 1 million - a couple of million dollars annualized, but aside from that, it's all rental. Gary Bisbee : And then just one last one for me, you have historically, in the fourth quarter, given a sense of the mix by product categories. Is that something you're willing to share this year? Thank you. Paul Adler : Yes. Gary, we have that for you. I can give you Cintas legacy business and the G&K business separately, just so you all for the first time, have a little bit of an idea of that mix. Going forward, it'll be very difficult, if near impossible, to separate the two as we continue to integrate. But for now, I can tell you that the Cintas legacy uniform rental business, about 49% of the revenue and I'm referring to the segment, not to the consolidated entity. So in looking at the uniform segment, 49% is garments. Dust control is 18%. Hygiene, which is restrooms, cleaning services, chemical services, that was 17% of revenue. Shop towels were 4%. Linen was 8% and catalog sales were 4%. And then in comparison, for G&K, their uniform rental mix. The garments are 55% of total revenue. Dust is 15%. Hygiene is 3%. Shop towels are 9%, and let's see, linen is 14% and catalog sales were 4%. So it really highlights what we had talked about previously that this is a business that doesn't have as broad of an offering as we do and so some good opportunities for us. In the future, you can see that hygiene line is much smaller as a percent of the total than it is for us. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Scott Schneeberger : Following up on Gary's question with regard to recent trends in organic, you guys were talking about Southwest and some other large, a large new business that came through, the way I interpreted it was in the fiscal fourth quarter that you thought might have come in the first half of fiscal '18. Could you just elaborate what type of impact that will have near term, you've given the full year guide, so I think we have that understood, but maybe some near term consideration for that, if impactful. Mike Hansen : Yes, Scott. We did roll the bulk of that program out in the fourth quarter. There is a very minimal roll out amount in the first quarter and then it - then it - as with these kind of programs, you get into a maintenance mode after that and so we would expect probably a little bit of benefit, a couple of million dollars in the first quarter and then tailing off into a maintenance mode after that. This was one that was - it was scheduled for right around the end of our fiscal year and so for the - for fiscal '17, as we were thinking about this a year ago and even six months ago, it was just - it was so close as to where it would fall and it happened to fall into the fourth quarter and our team did a real nice job of getting that to the customer. Scott Schneeberger : You mentioned SAP, 30 million impact in fiscal '18, but that it would persist on to '20, you may not want to give further guidance on '19 and '20, but just trying to get a feel or if you could refresh how you're thinking about a total spend over the period, the long term period. Mike Hansen : We - as Paul said, about $30 million in fiscal '18, about half of that is recurring and half non-recurring. And we would expect that that will go into fiscal '19 and then - and that will certainly be reduced - the non-recurring will be reduced in fiscal '20. We don't expect that implementation to take the entire fiscal '20 year, but it will go into '20. So we would expect something of the same in '19 and non-recurring less in '20. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Joe Box : So no mention on the route consolidation piece, I'm just curious is that a process that happens only when you guys consolidate facilities or can it be separate. And then when that route consolidation does happen, what's been your experience with the level of disruption you might have with your customers, relative to maybe the benefits you might see. Mike Hansen : So you're right, we didn't - we really didn't speak a whole lot to the, let's call it, the prioritization of the synergy buckets. And so maybe I'll touch on that a bit. And so I'm speaking of the 130 to 140 now, we would expect that the largest bucket is the G&A stream. It's the elimination of redundant, corporate processes as well as some location G&A expenses. The second largest would be - the second largest bucket would be that production facilities. So the combination of locations, the elimination of redundant capacity is certainly a fairly good sized opportunity for us. We think that third bucket will be the sourcing piece and while that is one of the longer timeframes of this process, we think that's a good opportunity. We think that from a routing perspective, there certainly is the fuel benefits that Paul talked about from combining the route forces and creating much more density. But we're hesitant to say that there will be a lot of route consolidation. We definitely need capacity on our routes to make sure that we have the time to meet with our customers, the time to build relationships, to make the service calls that we need to make. And so we see that as certainly a route optimization opportunity, but we don't see that as one of the bigger, a consolidation being one of the bigger opportunities there because we like the capacity. We're general - for the last probably seven years, we've been adding routes every single year. And the last thing we want to do is cut routes only to add them again. So it's really more about route optimization. And now as it relates to the timing of that, an integration generally will mean the system is first. We have to get on the same system, so that our different operations can speak to each other. And once we get on the same system, then the route optimization can happen. So, it's usually following the location consolidation or system integration. Joe Box : I guess, do you have the ability to bring a lot of G&K's route into your existing facilities or vice versa? Or you could pass the constraint maybe at the plant level and I guess ultimately, I'm trying to understand how much can be pulled and what the consolidation opportunity could be among the different plants, because obviously there's a lot of overlap. Mike Hansen : I'm not going to get into a specific number, but I was - let me be clear. I was speaking of route opportunities there, not production facility and location opportunities. We think there is quite a bit of opportunity. That was that second largest bucket that I mentioned. So in other words, the servicing of the routes, we certainly think there are consolidation opportunities in many markets and that certainly is one that is a big part of our integration plan. I'm not going to get into location numbers, but that certainly is the second largest opportunity within that overall synergy play. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from John Healy with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. John Healy : Thank you. Mike, I wanted to ask a question based on the prepared remarks. I think, you made a comment that over the next four years, you would see G&K operating margin at 25%. Did I catch that right and if that is the case, maybe you can provide some perspective on where you could potentially see Cintas or what I would say real Cintas operating margins, maybe potentially over the next four years or so? Mike Hansen : You did hear correctly, John and so if we think about that G&K block of business, that had been at about a 12.5% operating margin. The synergies of 130 to 140, it gets you to 25 or better percent of that block of revenue. So that's what I mean by that 25% operating margin for that block of business. Now, obviously, that block of business is - we're in the process of fully integrating that into this Cintas block of business. And so we will lose the specific reporting of that. But, if we add that kind of volume with that kind of incremental margin, I certainly see that, I want to say that alone is 100 basis point improvement in overall operating margins. And I think that we have room to grow still in all of our businesses as well. So I think there is still opportunity in rental to drive higher. There certainly is opportunity in first aid and safety and the all other still has opportunity to grow. So without giving you a number, I think all of our businesses have opportunities to grow and the incremental margin from the G&K block of business certainly will be a big part of that. John Healy : And I wanted to ask, I might have missed it, but did you guys give CapEx guidance for 2018 and is there any thought about what CapEx could be, maybe as a percentage of revenue or kind of longer term, once the businesses are completely married together and running smoothly? And then lastly, just on tax rate, I thought you said 34%, so a little bit lower than what you guys have seen in the last couple of years and I was just wondering if that's kind of a new kind of run rate for you guys. Paul Adler : Yeah. John, the tax rate is lower because of that change in accounting standard on equity stock compensation. So it muddied kind of our results this year and that's why we're - that's one of the columns and the tables in the earnings release to try to get that out, so you can see an apples-to-apples comparison, but because of that standard, we do believe the effective tax rate will be lower than the typical 37% that it had been. So - and that's why we've guided that way. In terms of CapEx, we did guide - I thought it was in the script 280 million to about 320 million for fiscal '18. And, I think what is a percent of revenue, we've typically been in that 4.5% of revenue area. It's been higher from time to time in the past few years especially with the SAP spend of what, 140 million over the last three years. But I think that that's probably a good metric now to use going forward as a percent of revenue. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : Can you provide an update on what you're seeing in the pricing environment, both in terms of existing business and new business wins. We heard from one of your primary competitors in the quarter that they were seeing some increased competitive pressure on pricing. So just wondering if you're seeing any of that as well. Mike Hansen : I would say, Toni that the pricing environment hasn't changed a whole lot. It's still fairly constructive and it doesn't feel much different than it has for the last year or so. And I would say that that would mean that it's always competitive and it remains competitive, but I wouldn't say it's been any more so in the last quarter than prior to that. Toni Kaplan : Got it. And then on de-levering, you mentioned you want to get to two times that EBITDA, just to clarify is that gross or net and then just on M&A, should we expect that you'll continue to do tuck-ins as you integrate G&K or would you sort of wait until the integration is over. Mike Hansen : So the leverage question, generally, that's gross because some of the cash that we have on our balance sheet is outside of the US and can't really be used to pay down and some is in restricted. For example, letters of credit type things. So it is gross and we expect that certainly to come down nicely in fiscal '18. As it relates to acquisitions, yes, I would say that we like tuck-in acquisitions. We like them in our rental business and our first aid and safety business and in our fire business. And I would expect that once we get to that leverage level that we've guided towards, that two times range, that will become, I would say, active like we have been in the past. Operator : We will now take our next question from Dan Dolev with Nomura. Dan Dolev : Can you discuss the level of new business in the core Cintas rental that you're expecting for the next year? I think you discussed it for the G&K part and you discussed the lost business for both, but can you discuss it for the core - the new business for the core. Thanks. Mike Hansen : Sure. We would expect growth in that new business. Certainly, that is the - that's the driving force behind our organic growth. We want to make sure we are signing up new customers, because that certainly helps with future penetration opportunities. We expect it to be strong and we expect it to grow over 2017 levels. Dan Dolev : Did you expect it to be in line in terms of the magnitude, in line with the 2017 rate or higher or lower? Mike Hansen : Yes. I would say yes, because the implied growth rate from our guidance that we talked about is pretty much in line with the last couple of years opening guidance and so, yeah, so that would be in line. Dan Dolev : And the 5% to 6% rental or implied rental growth guidance, is it just conservatism? Mike Hansen : No. We think it's a reasonable rate. It's where we've been the last couple of years and we certainly would like to do better than that, but I think as we look to the next year, we'll lap the energy - the easier comps from energy. As we sit here today, I would say that I feel - while the economy is constructive, I would say it's maybe not quite as so as it was six months ago. So what we feel good about the guidance and look if we do see the economy do better, if we start to see some - even some better penetration rates, we can certainly do better, but we think it's a good starting point. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Tim Mulrooney : Yeah. I'm just trying to get a sense for what your Uniform Rental gross margin could be in a couple of years. Can you point to any historical examples of when you increased your route density from an acquisition, how that impacted your gross margin? Was there any material structural lift when you acquired Omni or Unitog, for example? And if so, how long did that take to manifest? Mike Hansen : I don't have anything from those two acquisitions right in front of me. Keep in mind those were 15 and 17 years ago, but I think as we think about today, given the synergy cadence that I kind of mapped out a few minutes ago, it certainly would imply that the G&K gross margin of 40 will improve. And I would expect that that improvement will be over and above where current Cintas levels are today. So while I'm not ready to give you a specific number, that certainly will be accretive to the overall gross margin of the rental segment. And I think we should see some nice movement in the next couple years as we complete the integration and recognize those synergies from the consolidation. Tim Mulrooney : No, that's very helpful. And given the - we're running up against 5 :00 here. I'll just throw one more out there. For a long time now, you guys have talked about 60% of new customer growth coming from no programmers. And the question I often get is where are these new customers coming from? Can you give us a few examples of new industries or verticals that you're entering or maybe in the early stages of penetration that maybe you weren't in 5 to 10 years ago? Uniform Rental has been around for a long time, obviously, and I'm just trying to get a better idea of where you're getting this very solid growth, where that's coming from. Thank you. Paul Adler : Yes. You're right, Tim. We've talked about of our new business dollars, about 60% of them are coming from no programmers, those customers that don't have a rental program and yeah, I mean, there are a few buckets that we can talk about, the first is scrub rental. We've talked about that in the past. Scrubs was largely a direct sale, commodity and we work to change it into a rental program with a service element to help hospitals and other health care institutions control their inventory through those dispensing units, but that's something we've really gotten into in earnest in the last five years. It's a huge market and it's a market that we're in the very early innings of penetrating. And so we're getting some good wins, but we have a long way to go in that sector. Another good industry for us, the sector for us for no programmers is in the trades areas, that Carhartt product line that we've talked about, that rugged look. Those are garments that really appeal to people that work in the utility industries or plumbers, electricians, anyone in trades and we've had a lot of traction with that product. So - and then just in general, it's really the recognition that, I think Mike mentioned this earlier, we have to gravitate in the product line to where the employment is. We've done a very good job of that by creating these garments, some are branded, but also creating garments that are more retail inspired, polos and microbial shirts, et cetera that we can get into industries that are customer facing like resorts, theme parks, et cetera. And so, yeah, a lot of opportunity, that just kind of gives you an idea of some of those no programmers that are out there. Mike Hansen : And Paul touched on garments and I would say another difference is, over the course of probably the last five to seven years, we've - because of the breadth of our product line, we lead with facility services much more than we did maybe ten years ago. And so we are able with our facility services, I think, we talked about this earlier, we can add value to almost every kind of business there is, because almost every business has doors that can use entrance mats, have restrooms that can use our rest room and hygiene products. Many of them have employees that can use our first aid and safety services. Almost all of them have fire protection needs and so we're able to lead with non-uniform rental opportunities and solutions much more than we did ten years ago and that has certainly helped us as well. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : I just want to probe a little bit more about the component of the moving parts of attrition versus new business in terms of your calculation that G&K's revenue would decline 7% to 10%. What's a normal attrition rate for that business and can you just discuss that a little bit in what you might be doing to just try and offset some of that. Generally, I think you guys are very customer focused and I would expect you to be even more so in a situation like this. Mike Hansen : Sure. So you've heard us probably talk about our customer retention being in the mid-90% range. And G&K ran a big - ran a good business and they were in the - their customer retention was in the low 90% range and so when we think about that, let's call it, 7-ish lost business factor, that's not unusual for our industry and the difference as I spoke to in the prepared remarks, the difference is we'll continue to see that and we're certainly doing our best to build relationships with our customers. But that happens and typically a business will replace that with the new business efforts and there will be a temporary disruption to that replacement as we train our reps and get them productive. Shlomo Rosenbaum : And how long does it take you to train those reps, because what you're also doing is you're not taking unskilled reps, you're taking reps that have been doing things in a certain way and I guess you're improving upon it, but you're not taking someone - very often, you're not taking someone green. Mike Hansen : We're not, but that doesn't mean that they train and they're up to - they're up to normalized productivity levels as soon as they're finished training. It's a process and while the training, the specific training, maybe over the course of a month or so, the ramp up in productivity takes a bit of time and then in our business Shlomo, I'm sure you understand this, the weekly sales are not huge businesses. This is a momentum kind of a business and our new sales partners are going to go from not selling much at all to ramping up to $100 to $200 in revenue per week. And so it's a - that ramp up takes some time to make an impact on the overall revenue of the company. And so as we think about the - that replacing, we certainly are going to see an impact to our fourth quarter growth rates of fiscal '18 and now continue into probably the first half of fiscal '19. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Are you talking about the impact you're talking about where it's going to start to accelerate? Mike Hansen : I'm talking about - when I talk about the impact, I'm talking about the fact that you're going to see some deceleration in our growth rate in that fourth quarter of fiscal '18 and into the first half of fiscal '19. So if you think about it, I mentioned that the revenue run rate of G&K is about 960 right now for our fourth quarter, right. We're guiding to 870 to 900 for the year. So clearly, our fourth quarter is going to have a less revenue for that block of business and that's going to impact growth. And that impact is going to happen for probably the first half of the year and then we'll start to see that acceleration come back. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Just to be clear, you're talking about fiscal year '18 where you're going to see the impact or fiscal year '19 where you're going to see the slowdown? Mike Hansen : Fourth quarter of '18 and first half of '19. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So the training will come at that point in time after you've upgraded the systems? Mike Hansen : No. The training is happening right now. The training is happening right now. It's just that again when we go through this period of time where this selling resource isn't bringing in much new business, it takes a little bit of time to recover from that. Operator : Thank you. And we'll now take our final question from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Judah Sokel : It's actually Judah on for Andrew. Just a very quick question here at the end. I wanted to clarify the clean EPS number in the quarter. We called out $1.18 for legacy Cintas, and there was also $0.05 of contribution from G&K. So I think it's pretty clear that would imply a $1.23 if you include G&K together. But I wanted to confirm that the G&K results include that $9.5 million of amortization or $0.05 of EPS. So if you fully included G&K, I'm calculating an adjusted EPS of really $1.28. Is that the right way to think about it, adding back the amortization? Mike Hansen : Well, you are correct in saying that certainly the $1.18 plus the $0.05 get you to $1.23 as a clean number. Yes. The amortization was $9.6 million in the quarter, which is roughly $0.03. So if you want to add that back, yes, that would get you to $1.28. And you'll notice when we convert to our guidance for fiscal '18 and show a comparison of fiscal '17, you'll notice that we show a baseline of 4.77 [ph]. And so just to be clear, that is then the Cintas legacy plus the G&K operating results plus the ASU impact on the full year that gets you to the 4.77. Is that clear, Judah? Judah Sokel : Yeah. That is. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Mike Hansen : Well, thank you, again for joining us tonight. We look forward to talking to you as we complete our first quarter and have our conference call in September. Good night. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Before getting into our financial results, I want to take this opportunity to recognize our employees whom we call partners, impacted by the major hurricanes striking Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and surrounding areas. Many of our partners suffered significant losses in these natural disasters. Our thoughts and prayers go out to them. In addition, we thank them for their dedication to the company as they continue to tend to the business and needs of our customers despite the impact to their personal lives. Finally, we are grateful to the many Cintas partners who have helped their fellow partners in need via donations of money, clothing, personnel care and time. In true Cintas spirit you were ready and eager to help. We are pleased to report that revenue for the first quarter which ended August 31 was $1.611 billion, an increase of 27.2% over last year's first quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 8.3%. New business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services, and customer retention remains strong. The organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 8.1% and the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 11.9%. First quarter gross margin improved 40 basis points to 45.9% from 45.5% last year. This is our 16th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement. We believe that this quarter's increasing gross margin over prior year is particularly noteworthy because it was realized despite the headwind of adding the G&K business at a considerably lower gross margin. The Cintas legacy gross margins continued to expand and the G&K gross margins will too as we realize the acquisition synergies. Operating income for the first quarter of $249 million increased 22.1% from last year's first quarter. Fiscal '18 first quarter operating income was negatively impacted by $4 million of transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K Services acquisition compared to about $3 million of such expenses in the first quarter of last year. Excluding G&K transaction and integration expenses, operating income increased 22.4% to a margin of 15.7% versus 16.3% last year. The 60 basis point decrease in the operating margin is due to an increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue. Intangible asset amortization expense increased about 75 basis points over last year's first quarter due to the G&K acquisition, another year-over-year impact is a 20 basis point increase in depreciation expense because of SAP. Net income and earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '18 were $161 million and $1.45, respectively. EPS was negatively impacted by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition of $0.03 and $0.02 in the first quarter's of fiscal '18 and fiscal '17, respectively. Excluding these expenses, EPS was $1.48 versus $1.26, a 17.5% increase. As a result of our first quarter results, we are increasing our annual guidance for fiscal 2018. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $6.325 billion to $6.400 billion and fiscal '18 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.38. Our guidance excludes any future G&K transaction and integration expenses. The guidance does, however, include our preliminary estimates of the negative impact from the hurricanes. Based on early -- our early assessment, we estimate fiscal '18 revenue to be reduced by approximately $10 million to $15 million and EPS to be reduced by about $0.05 to $0.08. These estimates are subject to change as more information becomes available. Again this EPS guidance does not include any future G&K transaction and integration expenses. However, we do expect that these expenses will be incurred in the remainder of fiscal '18 as we continue to integrate the significant acquisition. We estimate that these expenses will range from $50 million to $65 million for the full fiscal year. As our Chairman and CEO Scott Farmer was quoted in today's earnings press release, the integration of G&K continues to proceed as expected. We are pleased with our performance. We remain on track to meet the acquisitions financial and nonfinancial objectives. Our guidance includes the following assumptions related to the acquired G&K business. Revenue to be in the range of $885 million to $905 million compared to a prior year amount run rate of about $965 million. Synergies of approximately $50 million to $55 million and an EPS contribution of $0.15 to $0.17. I will now turn the call over to Paul for additional details. Paul Adler : Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2018 contains the same number of work days per quarter as fiscal year 2017. The number of work days by quarter within fiscal year 2018 do differ however and are as follows. 66 in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3, and 66 in Q4. One less workday in a quarter had a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses including rental material cost, depreciation expense, and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of a workday basis. We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in all other. All other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and all other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogues to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.311 billion, an increase of 31.9% compared to last year's first quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 8.1%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 46.1% for the first quarter, an increase of 10 basis points from 46.0% in last year's first quarter. As Mike touched upon earlier, there is more to the performance here than meets the eye. Last quarter when we were still able to separate the performance of the G&K business from the legacy Cintas business, we noted that the G&K gross margin was 40.2%. Also when excluding the G&K business, last quarter's legacy Cintas Uniform Rental and Facility Services business gross margin improved 100 basis points. Considering the fact that we have only just begun to recognize synergies from the acquisition, and those synergies realized to date are mostly general and administrative in nature as opposed to benefit in gross margin. Gross margin performance is similar in this first quarter as it was in the previous quarter, meaning excluding the G&K business, there was healthy improvement year-over-year in the gross margin of the legacy Cintas Uniform Rental and Facility Services business. As previously stated, the G&K gross margin will improve to Cintas legacy levels as we realize the synergies from the acquisition. For instance, one of the factors resulting in a currently lower G&K gross margin is that energy expense as a percent of revenue is much higher than the Cintas legacy business. This is the result of the smaller G&K business lacking the route density that the larger Cintas legacy business possesses. The fuel savings from route density along with the benefit of reducing redundant capacity will drive significant improvements in G&K gross margin over time. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $140 million, which was 12.6% higher than last year's first quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 11.9%. This segment's gross margin was 47.5% in the first quarter compared to 45.8% in last year's first quarter, an increase of 170 basis points. Our margins continue to benefit from the realization of ZEE acquisition synergies, including improved sourcing and the leveraging of existing warehouses. In addition to the strong year-over-year performance, it is exciting to see the improvement of the gross margin percentage from pre-ZEE acquisition levels. In the quarter before the ZEE acquisition, the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, the segments gross margin was 46.8%. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018 the margin is 70 basis points higher. This is do not only to the realization of the ZEE acquisition synergies, but also to continued strong execution in both sales and operations that ensures growth in both the top and bottom line. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the all other category. All other revenue was $159 million, an increase of 7.9% compared to last year's first quarter. The organic growth rate was 6.3%. All other gross margin was 42.5% for the first quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.1% for last year's first quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. The Uniform Direct Sale business by its nature is not the recurring revenue stream that our other businesses are, such as uniform rental and facility services and first aid. Therefore the growth rates are generally low single-digit and are subject to volatility such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Our fire business, however, continues to grow at a rapid pace. The fire business organic growth rate was just shy of 10% and operating margins expanded. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.2% in the first quarter compared to 29.2% in last year's first quarter, about 75 of the 100 basis point increase is attributable to the amortization expense of the intangible assets established and the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition. Also SAP expense was up 20 basis points year-over-year. The prior year first quarter do not include any depreciation expense from SAP, because the project was still in the pilot phase. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter was 26.5% compared to 28.2% for last year's first quarter. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to discrete items. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 to be about 34%. Our cash and equivalents balance as of August 31 was $191 million and we had $21 million of marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash flow from operating activities in the fiscal 2018 first quarter was $254 million and free cash flow was $191 million. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were approximately $62 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows : $51 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $7 million in First Aid and Safety, and $4 million in all other. We expect fiscal year 2018 CapEx to be in the range of $280 million to $320 million. As of August 31, total debt was $2.841 billion consisting of $307 million in short-term debt and $2.534 billion of long-term debt. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, $293 million of debt was repaid. At August 31, our leverage was 2.5x debt to EBITDA. We expect our leverage ratio to decrease to approximately 2.0x to 2.2x debt to EBITDA at May 31, 2018. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're happy to answer your question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jay Hanna : Hey, guys. This is actually Jay Hanna for Gary today. Mike Hansen : Hi, Jay. Jay Hanna : Just a quick question with regard to the G&K integration costs. Should we expect these to fall at the low end of the range given the $4 million seen in this previous quarter, and could you give a little more color on what the cadence should be for the remainder of the year? Mike Hansen : I'm not ready to say that we should be at the low end of the range. I think we will be in that range. The smaller amount in the first quarter is just simply because there's still a lot of heavy lifting to do as it relates to the integration and I'll give you an example. While we've made some really good progress on reducing the former corporate headquarters, we're not fully out of that headquarter building yet and we\u2019re not able to impair that lease until we're fully out of it. So that's an example of why we've made quite a bit of progress, there will likely be an impairment charge coming still and there we have a number of similar examples. So I would say we're still going to be somewhere in that range certainly given that that it was only about $4 million in the first quarter. There it\u2019s going to pick up and I would say that the back half of the year is going to see the bulk of that. Jay Hanna : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead. Manav Patnaik : Yes. Hi. Good evening, guys. If the amount -- the dis-synergy assumption for G&K revenues, it sounds like you lowered that assumption, is that correct and maybe why? Mike Hansen : Well, we change -- if you're talking about the revenue expectation for the year, we increased that slightly from a range previous of 870 to 900 to 885 to 905. So we did slightly increase the revenue expectation. And I would say for the first quarter we're pretty much right in line where we expected, may be slightly ahead. The first quarter revenue was about $236 million, that was about a 3% decrease from the prior year for that block of business. As you know, we've talked a lot about that continuing to decrease through this year such that it will probably bottom out in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of fiscal '19. And so, while we are seeing the revenue that we expected, we still believe that it's going to continue to decrease as we start to recover from the absence of new business, and that will -- that -- again that decreasing revenue will continue through this fiscal year as evidenced by the guidance that we are giving, 885 to 905. Manav Patnaik : Got it. And then just -- maybe anecdotally like could you give us some stats in terms of the number of overlapping plant facilities and/or routes and stuff you guys have, and how many of those you\u2019ve consolidated thus far etcetera. Are those fair things to ask for? Mike Hansen : Well, let me talk a little bit about first quarter integration activities \u2026 Manav Patnaik : Okay. Mike Hansen : \u2026 and that will give you some color. Our first quarter synergies were about $7 million. So that's 7 out of the 50 to 55. The activities that that happened in that first quarter and I\u2019m not going to give you every single one, but generally speaking we converted the payroll system as we talked about on our last call. We converted to the Cintas financial system. We have made progress on reducing the functions located at the former headquarters, and we have also converted or consolidated a few dozen branches into Cintas locations and one processing plant into Cintas locations. So we have had some -- we've had a lot of activity, much of that coming towards the end of the first quarter where we will start to see the synergies from those in the last three quarters of the year. Manav Patnaik : Okay, got it. Mike Hansen : I'm not ready to give you any number on how many we expect to eventually consolidate, but maybe I will give you a little bit of color on the integration activities. It's -- this is a -- it's a fairly complex process for us and our partners are doing a great job of executing so far, but maybe I'll give you a couple of details of what goes on. In one of these integration activities it's about a 16-week process, and maybe I'll touch on a couple areas starting with data. We need to -- for that locations information, we need to map every item and every product and service from a former product number in the legacy G&K system to the Cintas system. We need to set up every single G&K legacy customer into the Cintas system, that means everywhere. Everywhere is garment sizes, the number and type of masks that they might have, all other items that they are getting serviced. The pricing related to each customer wear map etcetera, any recent activity we need to bring over to know if we have new hires at a customer, if they are recent terminations or any other changes in the services. And then we got to run parallel on invoicing data and other data to make sure that it has been loaded properly. So there is a lot of data work that needs to be done which -- with each and every one of these. Next area is inventory. For example, we need to take every garment that we had in from the G&K product line and map it or determine what we're going to do with that garment. Are we going to replace it with the Cintas product or are we going to continue to source that G&K product, so we got to map all of those different products and services. We have to re-barcode every garment that's -- that is in service. So every garment that we have today has a barcode on it that indicates customer route number or wearer number. And so the re-barcoding of that, I will just give you a couple of numbers. 170,000 customer locations for legacy G&K with an average of about 10 wearers with 11 shirts and 11 pants, that\u2019s about 37.4 million garments that need to be re-barcoded. So it is quite the effort. And again our team is doing a super job and there are other areas that I could go through as well, but I just want to give you a little bit of a sense of the amount of detail as well as the amount of work that\u2019s included in each and every one of these consolidations. And I think we\u2019ve been doing a great job at that. And I'll finish with the 20 other things that we've spent quite a bit of time on in this first quarter is doing a lot of mapping and creating a bridge from the legacy G&K system to our SAP system. And that is a big project and in fact we converted our first location to SAP yesterday and we're certainly excited to see that happen and as long as that continues to go well, we will be ready to add or convert more and more of those locations that are going to remain open. So we're off to a really good start. We're right in line with where we expected our partners doing a super job of executing and we will provide more detailed quarter-to-quarter as we move forward. Manav Patnaik : Great. That was lot of good detail. I will get back in the queue. Operator : And we will take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : Hey, good afternoon. Mike Hansen : Hi, Toni. Toni Kaplan : Could you give a little bit more color on the drivers of the First Aid acceleration and also just the profitability drivers within that segment this quarter as well? Paul Adler : Yes, Toni. This is Paul. We talked previously about that organic growth rate bottoming out and that was kind of the math associated with that ZEE acquisition. ZEE being a third of the legacy business not growing and yet that legacy business was growing strongly, that kind of blended out that the bottom to about 3.3% organic growth rate. And we expected it to climb out to historic levels, and we're very pleased that it has. 11.9 that's probably little bit higher than we typically run or its probably some easier comps benefiting us. But that's a business that we expect year in and year out to be growing high single-digits. So, in terms of the drivers there's really no silver bullet, no one particular initiative. It's just the continued execution of the sales force and continuing to sell new programs, penetrating the existing accounts. Some of the ZEE customers as well that will be part of that effort. And it's a very scalable business or there is a lot of capacity. So, as we continue to grow that top line, if we can grow it organically in a high single-digit rate, it is going to continue to push those margins forward. I mean, as I mentioned in the script, 170 basis points year-over-year that's outstanding. That is the benefits of those ZEE synergies kicking in, but at the same time growing a 11.9%. There's a lot of incremental profit fall into the bottom line pushing those margins. Mike Hansen : And Toni just one last comment. The -- we added quite a few sales people in the first quarter of last fiscal year to really help that business kick-start that growth as we\u2019ve then completed the ZEE system conversions etcetera. And we're starting to see that. We\u2019ve seen that productivity improve and as we expected that that kind of that percent to sale is kind of coming back down to where it should be. Toni Kaplan : Okay, great. And then, we saw an increase in gasoline prices at the end of August. Can you talk about if you\u2019re expecting to see just a headwind from that as you go through the next couple of quarters? Thanks a lot. Mike Hansen : Well, we saw it come up to about 2.1% of revenue in the first quarter and our expectations is that it will come up just a little bit as we move through the rest of the year. Toni Kaplan : Thanks a lot. Paul Adler : Yes, I will add to that, because we\u2019ve been talking a lot about the impact of oil and gas in the top line, that being a headwind. And finally that impact has become negligible. So I think it was 30 basis points of a headwind last quarter in Q4, but in first quarter its zero. And so going forward, it shouldn\u2019t be something we're talking about in terms of impact on the top line. We will be talking about increased energy costs impact on the bottom line. And I would add to that, we continue to watch the rig counts, but they kind of stabilize at times they are picking up, they\u2019re still significantly below prior-year levels and from our standpoint where at oil prices at this level we're not starting to see growth accelerate again and pick up. It doesn't seem to be a tailwind. We expect it to be pretty stable and just flattish from here on out. Toni Kaplan : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Hey, Mike and Paul, it seems like just in the guidance you -- the step up in guidance, it's very minimal amount is coming from less losses assumed from G&K, and I was wondering if you can just give us a little bit more detail on the things internally in the legacy Cintas that\u2019s making the business. You raised the guidance that much, right from the beginning of the year. Is it just -- maybe you could take some of the units and say, hey, this is having an outsized impact or we are going to see uniform rentals segment see 8% growth for several quarters in a row, or just give us a little bit more color on that. Mike Hansen : Well, I think we got off to a really nice start and the execution is -- it has been very good. And so certainly it -- you can tell from the guidance increase that it exceeded our expectations by a bit. And Shlomo, I -- there is not really any one particular reason other than I think the economy is stable and conducive for us. It hasn't seen -- haven't seen much of a change and our execution remains pretty good. I think as Paul mentioned, the last two quarters we've seen a bit of an ease of the year-over-year oil and gas impact. And as we move forward from here, you can probably see from our guidance that we don't necessarily expect the 8% to continue, but we still expect some pretty healthy organic growth as we move forward. Part of that reasoning is that that oil and gas year-over-year, let's call it easier comps, go away as we go into the back part of the year. And the other thing is we talked a little bit about the hurricane impact, and while it could've been a lot worse, it's still going to be about an impact of a headwind of about 30 basis points for the remaining nine months of the year. So when we think about where we are today, yes, we did get off to a pretty good start, a little bit better than we expected. The oil and gas year-over-year comp was a little bit easier as we move into the final three, a little bit tougher oil and gas comps as well as the hurricane impact. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman : Hi. I did hear you mentioned something on M&A amortization in terms of a number I think, but you just went too fast for me in the prepared remarks. Could you just tell us what the G&K M&A amortization is in the first quarter and what it is in the guide for fiscal year 2018? Mike Hansen : It is -- to the total company its about 75 basis points, to the rental segment it's 95 basis points. There -- Andrew, there is some part of that that is Canadian that could be affected by the exchange rate, but generally speaking, we expect that to be consistent for the remaining three quarters of this year. Andrew Steinerman : So those were the numbers for first quarter? In basis points you expect similar basis points for the rest of the year, right? Mike Hansen : Well, let me restate that, Andrew. I expect roughly a similar dollar amount for each of the three quarters. We do have one less workday in the second quarter and two less in the third quarter compared to the first, so the dollar amount I don't expect to change at all, but the percent of sale may tweak a little bit because of same dollar amount lower workday sales. For the full-year, it's roughly $50 million. Andrew Steinerman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. Good afternoon. With regard to the hurricane, could you speak a little bit to the cadence through the year? Is that all going to be impacted in the fiscal second quarter or would you expect more of a steady through the end of the year? And just a little discussion, too as a follow on, is it all handled through insurance, just the way it works on the cost side. Thanks. Mike Hansen : Yes, we expect about half of that impact revenue wise to be in the second quarter, and then the remaining half to be in the third and the fourth. So there are some customers that were out of service for some period, short period of time. We've been able to pick it back up. There are others that that we don't expect to come back at all unfortunately. So heavy in the second quarter, the remaining half in the third and the fourth. We were fortunate that we did not have much in the way of property damage at all and I don't expect that we will have much in the way of a business interruption insurance claim, but we may have a claim relative to our inability to see customers. But we're still going through all of those details. Scott Schneeberger : Okay. Thanks for that. And then, just shifting gears a little bit, could you provide an update with regard to SAP progression? Just thoughts on how that\u2019s going and anything financial on cadence that\u2019s worth calling out? Thanks. Mike Hansen : Well, the SAP is going very well. We're very pleased with it. We talked a lot over the course of the last particularly six months that injecting G&K into this SAP rollout mix is going to be something that we will be taking a heavy look at and figuring out how we want to do that. And so we spent a lot of time this summer creating that bridge as I mentioned before from the legacy G&K system to our SAP system, and that's been an important step for us to be able to move forward. So we have not converted quite as many Cintas legacy locations this summer as we originally planned because we want to be able to get G&K going. The G&K legacy locations going and be able to do waves of both as we move forward. And we feel really good about the ability to do that, but as I've mentioned previously, we do expect that that rollout will go into our fiscal '20 year. Scott Schneeberger : Great. Thanks for that and good job. Mike Hansen : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys. This is Mario filling in for Hamzah. Just wanted to see if you can give us a sense of whether a slowdown in the employment trends can be offset by greater cross-selling or how much of a fact are employment trends today to your business since its much more diversified versus your historical model? Said another way, can you sustain mid to high single-digit growth in a slowing employment backdrop? Mike Hansen : Well, we think -- Mario, in the last seven years or so we've grown several multiples above employment growth in GDP. And the reason is because we've been able to have a very good and healthy new business effort where two thirds of our new business comes from what we call no programmers. In other words, those businesses that don't have uniform rental programs. And so in other words, we're able to get new businesses into our products and services even if they are not additive to employment. And that's been an important factor for us over the last seven years coming out of the great recession. In addition to that new business effort we've been able to penetrate existing customers as we have continued to come up with innovative products and services and so that has been an important aspect. So as we look ahead, we do believe that we can continue to grow even with lessening employment because we've -- that's what we've done for the last seven years or so. Now, Mario, look the more jobs that get added the better. We were certainly all for it and that that will only have a positive impact on us. But if we see employment trends pullback just a little bit, we have been in that environment during the last seven years and we've been able to grow nicely. So we are -- we like where we are, we like our product line in our services. They can add value to almost every business in the U.S. We like our execution and our ability to reach those business opportunities, and so we're optimistic. Unidentified Analyst : Perfect. And just a quick follow-up. How big do you think the First Aid and Fire Protection to be over the long-term and where are we in terms of extracting the ZEE medical synergies? Mike Hansen : Well, as far as what that addressable market is, we haven't really talked about that publicly. And don't -- quite honestly, don't spend a lot of time. We just -- our goal is to reach more and more new business customers and with a million customers in total and 16 million businesses in the U.S and Canada, we think there's a lot of opportunity to continue to provide value. We look at that First Aid and Safety business, it's a great business because it's -- we sell it under the umbrellas of safety, compliance, and those are two important umbrellas and add a lot of breadth to the offerings that we have and we\u2019ve been able to broaden our product offering. So things like training are big opportunities for us. Continued sales of AEDs, continued sales of safety protection equipment, real nice opportunity. So we think we\u2019ve got a lot of runway there. As it relates to the ZEE synergies, we think we're getting them and I think the gross margin is a great sign of that. We are a third larger than we were pre-ZEE. Our gross margin has exceeded where we were prior to ZEE. And we think that as we continue to grow that SG&A we will likely come down some more to get that overall profit level back into the mid-teen. So we are really excited about that business and the breadth of customers that can add value to. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you so much. I appreciate the time. Operator : And we will take our next question from Dan Dolev with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead. Dan Dolev : Hey, thank you. Great job. Paul, you said GM grew nicely ex G&K. Can you quantify it in the first quarter? I may have missed it, sorry. Paul Adler : Dan, we haven't quantified it just because of the fact that as we\u2019ve said, we're making some of these integrations now. We\u2019ve had few dozen occurrence, so you're getting the blend of the two businesses. We just know that given that we're so early in the integration and a lot of work to do that -- that we feel comfortable that there is good expansion. But to put a figure on it is not something we're really able to do definitively at this point and going forward. Dan Dolev : Got it. And if I remember, did you say $0.15 to $0.17 from G&K? Paul Adler : Yes, for the fiscal [multiple speakers]. Dan Dolev : So it\u2019s the same number as in the prior quarter, even though you\u2019re raising the revenues, it\u2019s just being conservative, I mean, is that what we should understand? Paul Adler : We do think that the contribution is fairly flat for the year. And so, yes, to answer your question, yes, it is a fairly flat contribution. And the reason is as we\u2019ve talked about that revenue, we expect that revenue to continue to come down as we kind of get through the disruption of the new business effort. And as we see that revenue come down, we're going to have some decremental margin because of that. However, as we move through the year, we're going to create more synergies that will offset that -- more than offset that. But that the combination of that is a fairly flat contribution for the year. As we mentioned, in fiscal '19 we won't -- we do expect that that revenue will start to come back, the sales effort with that block of reps will come back, and so then as the incremental margin start to come as well as then the synergies we will see some nice benefit. Dan Dolev : And just squeezing in a question on this one, when you say bottom in F 1Q '19, is that a dollar bottom or year-over-year decline in rate that you are referring to on G&K? Paul Adler : That\u2019s both. It's both. It's a dollar decline and it will -- that will be the largest year-over-year decline percentage wise as well. Dan Dolev : Got it. So it will be another -- the smallest quarter dollar wise? Paul Adler : Yes. Now, Dan, I say that without getting out the calculator for workday differential, but generally speaking, yes. Dan Dolev : Understood. Well, great job. Thank you very much. Operator : And we will take our next question from David Stratton with Great Lakes Review. Your line is open. David Stratton : Good evening. Thank you for taking the questions. You previously mentioned your SAP integration on a previous question and how that relates to G&K. I was just wondering what the pace is like for the rest of the year. You had previously mentioned around a $30 million expense in fiscal '18, given that you\u2019ve kind of changed the rollout due to the G&K facilities and your Cintas facilities. How is that looking to shape up for the rest of the year? And is it still that $30 million range? Paul Adler : Yes, your recollection is correct. We had disclosed that for fiscal '18 our expectation is about $30 million expense for SAP. It was $12 million in fiscal '17. And the reason for the increased amount in '18 is because in what, maybe the fourth quarter of fiscal '17 is when we started depreciating the SAP asset. We were out of the pilot, felt really good about it, using the system, started depreciating it. So there's no change. Even though as you mentioned and as Mike mentioned we put our first G&K operation in SAP, it's just maybe a little shift of, is it a Cintas legacy operation versus a G&K operation, but no matter which operation it is, so to speak, it's still going to be $30 million of expense in this fiscal year. And you know good half of that $30 million is depreciation expense, which is fixed. David Stratton : Got you. Thank you. And then on the rental side, can you just kind of breakout the impact that you\u2019ve seen from your marketing campaign, ready for the workday, that\u2019s been in place for a while now and just with G&K I would like to hear a little bit more about how that\u2019s going and given the organic growth which is impressive, how much of that is due to that program and where are you seeing the most cross-selling? Is there a product line that you\u2019ve really been seeing benefits from? Mike Hansen : Well, I think as you probably understand, capturing the exact impact of a marketing program is pretty difficult and maybe a little bit more anecdotal. We like what we're seeing. I'm not ready to put an exact percentage or dollar amount on it, but we do like what we seeing and we do think that it has enhanced our organic growth to some extent. As you can see over the course of the last three quarters, we've had a nice organic growth in rental and I think an accelerating growth in the First Aid. Again, some of that we\u2019ve talked about being some oil and gas lapping, some easier comps in First Aid, but we do believe in that campaign. We do think that it has reached many prospects and customers. We have a lot of anecdotal positive examples. And so, we will continue with it and we certainly love the tagline Ready for the Workday and again we will continue with that, we will continue with our campaign. We are working to reach and touch as many prospects as we can and as well as current customers. And -- generally speaking, we think it has been a positive influence, not sure I can give you a number though. David Stratton : I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Timothy Mulrooney : Good afternoon. Congrats on another good quarter. Mike Hansen : Thank you, Tim. Timothy Mulrooney : So a couple of housekeeping questions. The tax rate, you said you expected 34% for the full-year, which kind of implies higher than 34% for the remaining three quarters given the lower tax rate in the first quarter. I\u2019m getting to about 36.5% for the remaining three quarters. Is that what I was supposed to take away from your comment or should I be modeling 34% for the remaining three quarters? Mike Hansen : Now, you\u2019re thinking about it correctly, Tim. If you remember going back prior to fiscal '17, so fiscal '16 and beyond, we generally ran with an effective rate of somewhere in the neighborhood of 37%. There was a change in accounting for equity compensation that allowed us to take a deduction for stock option exercises and restricted stock vestings things that we were not able to take in the past. That created a much lower effective tax rate in fiscal '17 and continues in fiscal '18 and we based on the fiscal year of May 31st, we have more vesting of equity compensation and more exercises of options during our first quarter than any other quarter. That's just the way that our grants typically work, and so we will continue to see generally a low rate in the first quarter and something that's closer to that historical 36%, 37% rate in the in the subsequent three quarters. Timothy Mulrooney : Got it. Thank you. Also -- okay, so now that you\u2019ve pulled G&K into the fold, you obviously have a larger and denser footprint than you did previously, which means better national coverage than you had previously. Does this improve your ability to grow share with National Accounts or was your coverage really sufficient enough previously that this isn't really a major growth opportunity associated with the acquisition? Mike Hansen : Yes, with the overlap with the G&K markets and our markets was significant and that was a really good thing for the synergy opportunities. But it didn\u2019t really give us many new markets, and so the footprint that we had prior gave us every ability to compete in the national account space and I would say that hasn't changed because of this deal. We still believe that we have the best service level to provide to national accounts, but that hasn't changed with this deal. Timothy Mulrooney : Okay. I thought maybe that was the case, just had to ask. Maybe one more. On the -- now that you\u2019ve had G&K for a couple more months since your last call, just curious if you have any better insight as to their penetration rates for their ancillary products. Were their mats at 60% penetration like yours are? What about hygiene, some of those other items, curious what the opportunity might be? Thank you. Mike Hansen : I think that Paul talked a little bit about this last quarter where the penetration on mats is probably not a lot different and that still provides an opportunity for us because we have a wider variety of mat opportunities, and so while they may have one or two mats we think that we have mats for even more situations. So anti-fatigue mats, kitchen type mats, logo mats etcetera. So we got a lot of opportunity with mats even if the penetration is not too far from ours. But the big opportunity that we did talk about was in that restroom hygiene area where G&K was about 3% of -- about 3% of the revenue was there, and ours is quite a bit higher than that. So it provides a real nice penetration opportunity and one that as we continue to integrate and that get on the same platform so we will certainly be looking towards adding that kind of value to those legacy customers. Operator : And we will take our last question from John Healy with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. John Healy : Thanks. Mike, I wanted to ask just margin related question. I think you mentioned that 2Q will have one last billing day as well as 3Q have three last billing days. Historically I think that\u2019s been like a 30 basis point or so impact on op margins. Should we expect similar in 2Q and 3Q this year or does it change much with the acquisition? Mike Hansen : So just to be clear, we talked that workday differential is sequential not year-over-year. And so sequentially we have one less in Q2 and then down to 64, which is two less in Q3. We've talked about a 50 basis point margin impact, let's call it 40 in gross margin, 10 in SG&A, but about a 50 basis point impact that\u2019s either year-over-year or sequential and I would expect that that does not change because of bringing G&K on. Now there are -- because of the synergy play and the SAP conversion going on and the pace during the second and third quarter, that could have some additional impact. But generally speaking, I would expect that we will still see that 50 basis point margin impact. John Healy : Fair enough. And then I just wanted to ask as a follow-up question on the storm related activity. Is there any way to talk about just the Houston market itself or just the markets in Florida, maybe as you look at today versus a month ago or two weeks ago relative to when the storms happened. What the routes are doing in terms of kind of the normalized level of business? Are they at a 40% throughput as compared to normal levels or 60% or just some color in terms of what the routes are doing today versus what they had been doing? Mike Hansen : Well, yes, it -- certainly early on it was fairly low, but I would say today we're back in the -- cash probably 85% to 95% range in those I would say in those territories without getting into each individual market. I would say those territories we're -- we've seen a kind of a remarkable recovery given the impact we could have seen. And so we're certainly thankful that we've seen the business come back to pretty decent levels and that's why you see only a $10 million to $15 million impact. John Healy : Great. Thank you guys and congrats. Mike Hansen : Thank you. Operator : And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Mike Hansen : Well, thank you for joining us tonight. We will issue our second quarter earnings in December and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Operator : And once again that does conclude today\u2019s presentation. We thank you all for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, senior VP of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Hansen : Good evening, and thank you for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. I am battling a little bit of a cough tonight, so I'm going to turn it over to Paul to get us through our prepared remarks. Paul Adler : Thank you, Mike. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We are pleased to report that revenue for the second quarter, which ended November 30, was $1,606,000,000, an increase of 26.4% over last year's second quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 7.7%. The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 7.3%, and the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 10.8%. Operating income for the second quarter was $235 million compared to $200 million in last year's second quarter. Fiscal 2018 second quarter operating income was negatively impacted by $13 million of transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K Services acquisition compared to about $3 million of such expenses in the second quarter of last year. Excluding G&K transaction and integration expenses, operating income increased 21.8%.  Operating income margin, excluding G&K transaction and integration expenses, was 15.5% versus 16% last year. Current year second quarter operating margin was negatively impacted 75 basis points by intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition. In addition, current year operating margin was negatively impacted by 25 basis points due to depreciation and implementation costs of our enterprise resource planning system, SAP. Net income and earnings per diluted share, or EPS, from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were $137 million and $1.24, respectively. EPS was negatively impacted by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition of $0.07 and $0.02 in the second quarters of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. Excluding these expenses, EPS was $1.31 versus $1.14 last year, a 14.9% increase. As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer, was quoted in today's press release, the integration of G&K continues to proceed as planned. Our pace of closing duplicate operations increased in the second quarter. We have now closed 50 operations. Also, 47% of G&K locations have been converted to the Cintas operating system. This activity enabled us in the second quarter to realize about $14 million in synergies, almost twice the amount of synergies achieved in the first quarter, which is right in line with our expectations. In addition, significant progress was made in our implementation of SAP, which remains on schedule. A total of 55 operations have been converted from the old operating system to the new SAP system. Our second quarter was one of solid progress on 2 important investments, G&K and SAP. Meanwhile, strong execution on the day-to-day mission of profitable growth continued. The steadfast focus of our employees on helping our customers get Ready for the Workday is evidenced by the strong organic revenue and earnings per share growth rates. As a result of our second quarter results, we are increasing our annual guidance for fiscal 2018. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $6,365,000,000 to $6,430,000,000 and fiscal 2018 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.39 to $5.46. Our guidance excludes any future G&K transaction and integration expenses. It also assumes a pretax reform effective tax rate range of 31% to 33%. Note that our guidance includes the following assumptions related to the acquired G&K business, revenue of $895 million to $915 million compared to a prior year amount of $965 million; synergies of approximately $50 million to $55 million; and EPS contribution of about $0.17. While the EPS guidance does not include any future G&K transaction and integration expenses, we do expect that these expenses will be incurred in the remainder of fiscal 2018 as we continue to integrate this significant acquisition. We estimate that these expenses will range from $50 million to $60 million for the full fiscal year. I want to comment on the impact to Cintas of U.S. tax reform. There will be significant benefits. As a profitable business with the vast majority of our earnings in the United States, we have historically paid a high tax rate. The reduction in the corporate tax rate will boost Cintas' earnings and increase cash. Also, we expect many of our customers to benefit from tax reform and invest additional amounts of cash to grow their businesses. Healthy and growing customers are good, of course, for our business. Tax reform will enable us to repay debt more quickly and then have additional cash on hand for our priorities, namely, investments, acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. The signing of the legislation by the President will be an accounting event for Cintas. We will need to revalue deferred tax liabilities.  In addition, the lower corporate tax rate will be applied January 1, resulting in a negative effective tax rate in our third quarter and a blended effective tax rate for the fiscal year. Our EPS guidance is based upon pretax reform effective tax rates of 31% to 33%, because we need more time to understand the new tax laws.  However, we do want to provide you with the results of our preliminary analysis. Under the new tax laws, we expect the effective tax rate for this full fiscal year to be in the range of 8% to 12%. We will incorporate this lower fiscal year '18 rates into our guidance over the next several months. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 and thereafter to generally be in the range of 23% to 26%. Please note that our fiscal year 2018 contains the same number of workdays per quarter as fiscal year 2017. The number of workdays by quarter within fiscal year 2018 do differ, however, and are as follows, 66 in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3 and 66 in Q4. One less workday in a quarter has a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of on a workday basis. We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services; and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segments includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,308,000,000, an increase of 30.8% compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 7.3%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.7% for the second quarter, a decrease of 20 basis points from 44.9% in last year's second quarter. A slight year-over-year margin decline results from the inclusion in this year's second quarter of a lower margin G&K business. In time, the G&K gross margins will improve to Cintas' legacy levels as we further integrate this business and we increasingly realize more of the synergies. For instance, one of the factors resulting in a lower G&K gross margin is that energy expense as a percent of revenue is much higher than the Cintas legacy business. Total segment energy expense as a percent of revenue was 20 basis points greater than in last year's second quarter. Half of the increase was due to G&K. This is the result of the smaller G&K business lacking the route density that the larger Cintas legacy business possesses. The fuel savings from route density, along with the benefit of reducing redundant capacity will drive significant improvements in G&K gross margin. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $139 million, which was 11.5% higher than last year's second quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for this segment was 10.8%. This segment's gross margin was 46.9% in the second quarter compared to 46.1% in last year's second quarter, an increase of 80 basis points. While year-over-year improvements to gross margin driven by ZEE acquisition synergies have largely been lapped, we still expect strong gross margin improvements as the business continues to grow. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. Uniform Direct Sale business long-term growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Our Fire business, however, continues to grow each year at a strong pace. All Other revenue was $159 million, an increase of 8.9% compared to last year's second quarter. The organic growth rate was 7.8%. All Other gross margin was 42.1% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 40.4% for last year's second quarter, an increase of 170 basis points. Both businesses had healthy increases in gross margin. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29.1% in the second quarter compared to 28.4% in last year's second quarter. Current year second quarter SG&A was negatively impacted 75 basis points by intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition. In addition, current year SG&A was negatively impacted by 25 basis points due to SAP depreciation and implementation costs. The prior year second quarter did not include any depreciation expense from SAP because the project was still in the pilot phase. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter was 33.3% compared to 34.9% for last year's second quarter. This equates to a $0.03 benefit to EPS year-over-year. Note that the effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve bills and releases relating to discrete items. As stated earlier, our EPS guidance assumes a pretax reform effective tax rate range of 31% to 33%. Our cash and equivalents balance as of November 30 was $236 million, and we had $22 million of marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash flow from operating activities in the first 6 months of fiscal 2018 was $379 million and free cash flow was $246 million. Capital expenditures for the first half of the fiscal year were $132 million. Our CapEx by operating segment for the 6-month period was as follows, $111 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services; $13 million in First Aid and Safety; and $8 million in All Other. We expect fiscal year 2018 CapEx to be in the range of $280 million to $300 million. As of November 30, total debt was $2,834,000,000, consisting of $300 million in short-term debt and $2,534,000,000 of long-term debt. At November 30, our leverage was 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA. Subsequent to quarter end on December 1, $300 million of fixed rate debt with a coupon of 6 1/8% matured. This debt was paid with cash on hand and from borrowings under our commercial paper program. On December 8, we paid a dividend of $1.62 per share, an increase of 21.8% over last year's dividend. We have increased this dividend for 34 consecutive years. It is an important part of our capital allocation strategy and illustrates our enduring commitment to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value.  Overall, our cash flow remain strong, and we continue to expect our leverage ratio to decrease to approximately 2.0 to 2.2x debt-to-EBITDA at May 31, 2018. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll first go to Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : I didn't catch if you gave the G&K revenue and growth rate in the prepared remarks? Michael Hansen : We did not, but the -- it was down about 4.4% year-over-year for the quarter, which is slightly better. You probably saw that Paul had mentioned an increased range. And so it was slightly better than what we expected, and -- but down still about 4.4%. Toni Kaplan : Okay, that's helpful. And I wanted to ask about -- given Aramark's AmeriPride acquisition, have you seen any changes in the competitive environment yet? I know the deal hasn't closed, but just any -- are you expecting to see any impact from those 2 companies coming together? And basically, yes, just any color on that would be helpful. Michael Hansen : Well, the deal hasn't closed, as you mentioned. And so I would say, we're -- I would expect that if we do see some impact to the industry, it won't be until after it closes. I would say, today, it's still very competitive. The environment is still very competitive and not much changed, though, from 3 months ago. Toni Kaplan : Got it. And just lastly, in First Aid, you had another double-digit growth quarter. Can you just give us a little bit of color on how long you expect this pace of growth to hold up? And what you would consider maybe a normalized growth rate in this segment, if you think that double digit is not normalized? Paul Adler : Well, Toni, we hope it's forever. Toni Kaplan : Yes, I'm sure. Paul Adler : Certainly, the expectations for that business, First Aid, have continued to be high single digits. We still have a lot of opportunity to grow our customer base and with the safety cabinets and other products and services, got OSHA and others drive required in those cabinets. There's still plenty of good organic growth to come. Operator : And we'll take a question from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Manav Patnaik : The first question was, I think you made a comment that the pace of synergies was growing faster than maybe what you expected and, I guess, that's indicated with the $14 million versus $7 million. But broadly, I guess, your guidance for the synergies for this year and for all of G&K, I guess, hasn't really changed. So I was just wondering if there was a disconnect between those 2 comments or how we should think of that? Michael Hansen : I think Paul's comment was synergies certainly have increased and accelerated in the second quarter, but it is in line with our expectations. We certainly did expect to see that number go up. If you remember after the first quarter, we had talked about a couple dozen locations being consolidated in the first quarter, but many at the end of that first quarter. And so we were able to see the synergies from those as well as some others during the second quarter. And so it is in line with where we expected, but certainly an acceleration of what we saw on the first quarter. Manav Patnaik : Got it. And then the comment on 47% of the G&K locations moved to Cintas operation platform and so forth. Is it fair to assume that, that 47% were probably the bigger heavy lifting locations and the remaining should be a much smoother integration? Or is that not right? Michael Hansen : No, it really is based on our timetable geographies and markets. And so it is a combination of both small locations and large locations. Still many to do, and -- but going well. Manav Patnaik : Okay. And then the last one I had was just on tax reform, I appreciate the color you guys gave. But I was just wondering, what if any, were some of the offsetting pieces from the legislation versus just a reduction in corporate tax rate? Michael Hansen : When we think about that kind of an ongoing rate of 23% to 26%, there are -- there is a big benefit, obviously, from the drop in the corporate rate. However, couple of things that I might point out. There is something called a Section 199 manufacturing credit that is no longer existing, and that had a small impact on us. There is also the Section 162(m) impact, which is the loss of the deduction for any executive comp over $1 million, that certainly will have an impact. But that's about it. And certainly then for there's the onetime toll charge, if you will, related to the taxing of foreign E&P. But generally speaking, look, we're very excited about the tax reform getting done. We do certainly still need to spend some more time with all of the details. But I would say, over the course of the next couple of months, we'll likely update our guidance to give some more specific thoughts. Operator : And we'll now go to Andy Wittmann from Baird. Andrew Wittmann : I guess maybe my first question is on the guidance, it looks like you took the tax rate down, I think it was 34%. The last quarter here was 32%. That's an EPS help right there. Is there an implicit -- as you look at the earnings profile of the business tax reform, is there something that changed in the profitability of the business that you expected in the quarter and the outlook for the balance of the year? Michael Hansen : Are you saying as it relates to tax reform? Andrew Wittmann : Well, no, I mean, it looks like, I think, previous guidance for tax rate was 34% now it's 32%, that should be about $0.15 of help, I think, to EPS, all else equal. But the guide range wasn't that much, so I was just wondering what explains the difference? Michael Hansen : Well, one thing to keep in mind is our third quarter has an additional loss of workday. But no, we think that margins for the second half of the year are still going to be pretty strong. And I wouldn't read a whole lot of detail into that other than the fact that we're kind of pleased with the quarter, and we're set up still to have a very good year in the back half of the year. Andrew Wittmann : All right. And then I wanted to go over to the G&K for my next one, with a pretty good number of facilities of G&K on the system like you've talked in the past that getting on the system is the prerequisite to revenue synergy. I know you've said pretty consistently that those were going to take longer, but I'm just curious, are you able to start talking about selling some of that stuff, now you've got a number of locations or do they all need to be on before you can get after that? Michael Hansen : No. When a location gets on, we can start to have training conversations and start to get into that. It's going to take a little bit of time to get the ball rolling and to create an impact. But no, once one location is on, we can start talking more about Cintas products and services. They will be available to that location from a system perspective upon conversion. Andrew Wittmann : Can we have some contribution, you think, later here in fiscal '18? Michael Hansen : I'm not expecting anything in fiscal '18. No. Andrew Wittmann : And then just on the cost synergies, if this quarter was $14 million realized and approximately $7 million in the first quarter. If you just take the run rate of $14 million per quarter from the last 2 quarters, that gets me to $49 million for the year, which is pretty much at the low end of your guidance range for the year. How should we think about those cost synergies? Are you -- does it look like you could exceed the targets that you laid out? Or should we expect some level of deceleration of the cost synergies for the balance of the year? Michael Hansen : We, I would say, there is a lot of heavy lifting to go still in the back half of the year. Our goal will be to get that synergy number to the high end of that range, certainly. But yes, there is a possibility that we can exceed that. I would say that that's more of a timing thing than a increase to the entire range of 130 to 140. But I think there's an opportunity for that as long as we continue to execute well. Operator : And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : Guys, just curious, some little items in the quarter. There was talk about the hurricane last quarter. Could you just give us an update, and I believe what you had said last time was it would have an impact on revenue by $10 million to $15 million and EPS 5 to 8. Can you just kind of give us a little bit more clarity? And then I'll follow up with the next one in a second. Paul Adler : Yes, Scott. That was our estimates at the time. You got that correct. And we said of the $10 million to $15 million, about half of that would be in Q2. Fortunately, we were always in good shape. We had mentioned on the last call that we didn't have much damage to our facilities, and we were able to be up and running. So it was just dependent upon how quickly the customers could get back up and running. But pleasantly to our surprise, they get up and running pretty quickly. And instead of, what, $5 million to $7 million top line impact in the quarter, it was only about $1 million. And then for the remaining 2 quarters, $1 million is probably top line at most. So good news is this turned out to be really a nonevent from the headwind to the top line. Scott Schneeberger : Okay. And I mean, you guys had a good quarter and revenue guidance went up for the year more than what you did in the outperformance versus at least our estimate in the quarter. I'm guessing, this contributed and was a sizable factor to that, that increased revenue? Paul Adler : No, I don't know if it was sizable. But yes, I mean, certainly, based upon our last guide, as I said, we expected maybe $5 million to $7 million of headwinds and it was only -- in the second quarter, it was only about $1 million. So yes, $4 million, $5 million of benefits but certainly the top line we see was much more than that. Michael Hansen : Yes, and I think, Scott, as I mentioned, the G&K revenue was a little bit better than we had expected. And our own -- the legacy organic growth continues to perform well. Scott Schneeberger : Great. I'm curious just kind of a two-pronger for the last question. The tax reform, you mentioned, the 23% to 26% tax rate in fiscal '18 and thereafter. But I had heard that you will have some deferred tax liabilities being revalued. And I thought I heard that you may even have a negative tax rate in the fiscal third quarter. So that's -- when you speak of the 23% to 26%, it's actually going to be lower for the year in fiscal '18 when that gets factored in the third quarter impact. Is that right? Michael Hansen : Yes. The range that Paul gave was 8% to 12% for fiscal '18 because of that revaluation of the deferred tax balances. So when you think about the -- if President Trump signs this on January 3, that creates an accounting event for us. We revalue deferred taxes. We have to -- we book the toll charge. And there may be other smaller adjustments that have to be booked, but the impact of the deferred tax reevaluation -- and keep in mind, all those deferred taxes are recorded at a 35% tax rate today and they will go down to 21%. That is a significant benefit or, let's call it, reduction in deferred taxes. And that will create the negative in the third quarter. But thereafter '18, the idea was, look, that's going to be disruption, no question about it at the time in the third quarter. But thereafter, we expect that 23% to 26% as kind of a normalized rate. Now clearly, there are always discrete events that happened like audits and other items that may cause us to move below or above that range at times, but that's kind of what we're thinking in terms of an ongoing rate. Scott Schneeberger : Got it. That's helpful. Yes, I totally missed the 8% to 12%, so thanks on that. And just the last part of the question, you did alluded to the benefits, obviously, this will have for your customers and for you. Could you kind of talk about a priority thought process of how you may use the excess cash benefit that you'll get from this tax reform event? Michael Hansen : Well, we're certainly evaluating that, Scott. I would say that when you think about the cash flow that we've generated in the past, our first priority is to invest in our business. And that's investing in our business, in our employees, whom we call partners, but then also in capital expenditures, et cetera. That is always our first priority. The second priority is we will continue to look for M&A opportunities when they make sense at the right value. We will likely continue to look at dividend increases and then share buyback. So I would say that our prioritization hasn't changed much, but certainly, this is the new wrinkle that we're going to need to spend some time on in terms of both short-term and long-term. And we're -- we don't want to make any quick decisions on that. That's an important opportunity and we're going to take the time we need. Operator : And we'll now go to Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman : What's the implied organic constant currency revenue growth for the total company in the second half of the year? And has that changed from a quarter ago? Or is the dollar revenue increased mostly around G&K doing a little bit better? Michael Hansen : It's a little bit of both now. Andrew, when we think about organic growth, keep in mind, our third quarter will be the same kind of organic growth calculation that we've been under for the first 2 quarters, and the fourth quarter is going to be impacted by the G&K deal being lapped, right. So we are -- it's just simply a math problem. We are going to see organic growth drop in the fourth quarter. So to answer your question about the guidance, it's a little bit of both. It's a little bit of nice performance in our legacy organic businesses, especially our First Aid and Safety. And it's also a little bit of nice performance in the G&K revenue. I would suggest that we're going to have another quarter of relatively normalized, if you will, organic growth in the third. It's going to come down in the fourth, just simply because we've lapped that and that's the way the math works. We then expect to see as we move in to '19, that organic growth begin to accelerate back to Cintas levels. Operator : Our next question comes from John Healy from Northcoast Research. John Healy : I wanted to ask just a philosophical question for you guys about pricing. With the comments that you made about tax reform it's clear that your customer should be in a better spot in '19. I was curious to know if you guys -- if you could remind me, if you do most of your price increases at the calendar level, or just simply when the contract comes up on an annual basis? And I was just trying to think about how you've approached price in the last couple of years, and does what you see in the economy cause you to be more confident and maybe pursue more pricing than maybe you have over the last couple of years? Michael Hansen : Well, I would say that the pricing environment is very competitive. It remains that way. But as I've said in the last several quarters, it seems to be constructive still. We probably have more price increases during the close of the beginning of our fiscal year, but that's not all customers, but probably a little bit more in that beginning of the fiscal year. In terms of our philosophy, it's a conversation about the value that we're providing to all of our customers. And so it is a customer-by-customer conversation about the wear and tear of the garments, the different products and services that we're providing, the service component, et cetera. And so it's a lot of different things that go into pricing. John Healy : Makes sense. And I want to ask you a question about kind of investments into the business. When you look at acquisitions, clearly, Aramark's doing a big deal with AmeriPride. When you guys get down to that 2x leverage or so, call it, 6 months from now, do you think that you're capable from a FTC standpoint to pursue acquisitions of that type of size? And do you feel like you're kind of limited in terms of the size of assets that you can pursue post G&K? Michael Hansen : Well, if we're speaking about specifically the Uniform Rental business, look, we'll take a look at all opportunities that are available to us. And do I think that we'd be able to do a large deal? I think it really would depend on that specific opportunity, and there could be some challenges. Our goal would be to take a look at it and evaluate how we feel about those challenges. And so, John, look, that's a -- to say whether or not we could. I think it just depends on the opportunity, but any big deal will likely come with some challenges. Operator : Now we will go to Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie. Mario Cortellacci : This is Mario Cortellacci, I'm filling in for Hamzah. Actually to piggyback off the last question. If there is further consolidation in the space, can we expect better pricing? Or what would that look like? Michael Hansen : Well, look, I mentioned that the pricing environment is fairly competitive today. It's been that way for many years, maybe a little bit more constructive in the last couple years. But I don't expect that to change. I think it will continue to be very competitive because there are many players both local, regional and national. And there are -- not everyone has to rent uniforms. And so I think there is -- we have to continue to show that we can provide a good value. But I think it's going to continue to be competitive. I don't see it changing much because of the Aramark/AmeriPride deal. Mario Cortellacci : Okay. And then, I know you've already touched on this in the past as well. But could you frame for us, I guess, how are you thinking about the longer-term benefits of the SAP implementation? Michael Hansen : Sure. We love that the information that this system will provide to us once we are -- once we have our entire business on. It allows us to much more quickly see opportunities that exist to look at industry specifics and be able to better target prospects, target existing customers for different types of products and services. And so more than anything, the information, we believe, will allow our salespeople and our service people to be more productive and efficient. Operator : And we'll now go to Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Gary Bisbee : Let me take another -- a different approach to the pricing. This has always been a competitive industry, you've acknowledged that regularly. What is the risk that some of the tax reform savings that the industry will earn gets competed away, think about an after-tax return as their margin or whatever is their focus. Is that -- do you see that as a risk? Is that -- any thoughts on that at this point? Michael Hansen : I think it's too early to tell, Gary. Certainly, that could throw a little bit of a wrinkle into the way our products and services are priced in the marketplace. We're going to have to keep our eyes on that and see how it plays out. But I think it's a little early, but certainly that we're going to keep our eyes on it. It is something that could add a little bit of a wrinkle. Gary Bisbee : Okay. All right. And then staying on the tax theme for just one more question. Does -- I realize it's early, but does the outline of the plan have you thinking any differently about your investment plans? I realize you've got a ton of stuff going on and probably the first thing to do is pay down the debt. But as you think out over the next couple of years, would it make you more likely to invest, to raise wages to hire people more quickly to accelerate investment projects? Or not really? Michael Hansen : Yes, I think, Gary, that all those things are likely on the table. We're going to evaluate, and we are going to -- we, first and foremost, we are long-term operators. And so, we're -- the first thing that we will do is evaluate how best this can make us stronger for the long-term. And there could be some short-term decisions because of that, there could be some longer-term decisions. But I think -- this is -- look, it's a new day, and we're going to have to get busy evaluating how to invest, how to best invest this benefit. But I don't have any answer. It's just -- it's not even signed yet, and we need to spend a little bit more time with it, but it certainly will have an impact. Gary Bisbee : Fair enough. And then have you put any thought yet to the CapEx ability to immediately deduct CapEx? It would seem to me likely that your cash flow would be -- have a meaningful benefit from that and that's your cash conversion, a percent of net income or however you want to look at it would likely improve at least for the next five years. Is it right to assume most of your CapEx would likely be eligible? Or is it also too soon to have a view on that? Michael Hansen : I believe that, that certainly will benefit us. Gary, I need to spend a little bit more time on the specifics of those rules. But, yes, I think it certainly could create an improved cash flow because of that immediate expensing over the next 5 years. But I'm -- I -- we need to do a little bit more research on exactly the CapEx that we have that qualifies, but I like it. And I think it's going to be positive for us. Gary Bisbee : Okay. And then just one non-tax one to close it out for me. Talk about the -- just how the math will work in accelerating organic growth once you lap G&K. What are the key factors that then get the reacceleration back towards the normal Cintas level? Is it that you've been hiring salespeople in their territories? Although, I would think those would overlap with your territories, is it more of the cross-sell impact? Or just that, that business is flattening out at some point and then the rest of the base is growing? Just trying to think through [indiscernible] Michael Hansen : Yes. Gary, I think it's all three of those. First of all, the revenue itself is going to bottom out, and that -- or that the decrease is going to stop, probably in our fourth quarter. But we have hired. We -- first of all, we brought on many legacy G&K salespeople for the open positions that they had. We have been hiring and training, and we saw some nice improvements in productivity from the first quarter to the second. And we like what we see so far. So -- and as you probably know, Gary, with our business, we sell many small accounts every single week and it takes a little bit of time for all of those small accounts to accumulate over time. And so as we think about fiscal '19, we will enter that fiscal year with a little bit better new business momentum from that block of salespeople. We will have seen the bottom of the trough in terms of the revenue overall. And then lastly, yes, we're going to start to see some benefits of cross-sell and penetration into those customers. I don't believe we'll see any impact in fiscal '18. But fiscal '19, we should start to see some impact. I think the biggest thing is really the new business effort, though, that will get back on track after about a year of those legacy G&K salespeople seeing a reverse momentum because of the announcement of the acquisition and then the retraining, et cetera. Operator : Our next question comes from David Stratton from Great Lakes Review. David Stratton : I couldn't tell, I don't know if you said or not, did you give a legacy Cintas gross margin number for the quarter? Michael Hansen : We did not, David. We have consolidated a number of those operations into the legacy Cintas locations, it becomes very, very difficult to separate what was from a gross margin perspective, what was legacy Cintas versus what was legacy G&K. David Stratton : Got you. And then, if you would talk for a minute about energy impacts you saw in the quarter and then what you see the rest of the year shaping up like in regard to energy costs and your customers in that field? Michael Hansen : Well, for the second quarter, we saw total overall energy rate of 2.2% of revenue. I would say for the second half of the year, maybe a slight increase, flattish to slight increase. Did that answer your question? David Stratton : Yes. And then I guess -- yes. No, that's good. Paul Adler : David, on the top line, I think you mentioned our customers, too, in that business. And we do watch the rig counts as an indicator of how things are performing and we definitely have seen stabilization in that customer base. And we've talked about that from last quarter to that and we kind of lapped all that. So it's stable, but we haven't seen a lot of growth in the customer base fueling that line of garments, flame resistant type garments. Operator : And we will now go to Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Timothy Mulrooney : Last quarter, you were at $7 million in synergies. Some of the major activities were converting the payroll system into financial system, reducing functions of the former headquarters at G&K and consolidating a few dozen branches. But are there any other major activities this quarter to get you that $14 million synergy figure? Or is this mainly just continuing to benefit from the actions outlined last quarter? Michael Hansen : Yes. It's primarily those that you just mentioned. So the continued reduction of the corporate G&A and getting almost a full quarter now of many of those savings, it is the benefits of the consolidation of a number of locations. So yes, it is all of those things. As we move forward, the items that are really left are continuing to convert to systems and to look at the sourcing opportunities that are out there because as we've talked in the past, we're still using much legacy G&K inventory, and so we need to burn through that. And once we burn through that, we'll start to then order through the Cintas supply chains. We expect that, that will create some saving opportunities. Timothy Mulrooney : Okay. You talked about material sourcing, is there perhaps also some room for density saving on the energy side, I mean, you said energy was 2.2% of sales today. I mean, what could that get to, could that get to below 2% at some point? Michael Hansen : Well, look, a lot of that depends on gas prices of the day. But I think Paul mentioned, if we were -- well, I'll say it this way, for that G&K block of business, that fuel is about 3% of revenue. And so there is an opportunity to pull that down, certainly. And as we have converted the system and we then begin the route optimization process, that allows us to do some rerouting and get those savings. So you are right, Tim. That will start to come over the next several quarters as we complete those kind of integration plans. Could it get below 2% in today's environment? I would say, it's -- I don't think so. I think it probably could come down 10 to 20 basis points as a company. But again, I would think about it from the standpoint of we can get that 3% down to probably something closer to 2% for that block of business. Timothy Mulrooney : Got it. Okay. And then staying on synergies, maybe just a couple more. Did you say that you closed 50 facilities since the acquisition was closed, Mike? Michael Hansen : Yes, we did. Timothy Mulrooney : But I think you were at about 420 locations following the deal closing. Is that -- I mean, just simple math, are you at about 370 today? Michael Hansen : I haven't looked at that. I believe your math, but I haven't specifically looked at that, but it sounds reasonable. Timothy Mulrooney : Yes, not important. I was just curious, I guess. And then on the $14 million in synergies today, is that then split pretty evenly between SG&A and the consolidation of facilities? That 50 was a little bit higher than I was expecting. And you still expect that $50 million to $55 million by the end of 2018 to be majority SG&A? Michael Hansen : For the quarter, yes, Tim, you were correct that it's pretty close to a 50-50 split in terms of SG&A versus gross margin. By the end of the year, I think it's going to start to tilt towards gross margin as we get more and more of the benefits of consolidation of locations and that the system conversion and route optimization. So I think we will start to tilt more heavily towards the gross margin. Operator : And we'll now go to Sean Egan from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Sean Egan : Just one quick one for me. I'm just curious if you can talk about any difference in the performance of G&K locations, those 47% on Cintas systems and the balance off in light of the 4.4% revenue decline within the legacy G&K? Just wondering if you're seeing any clear differential yet. Michael Hansen : No. No, we're not, Sean. I think, the issue is as we move any location, whether it's a legacy Cintas or G&K, there is disruption during that period of implementation -- I'm sorry, of conversion, system conversion. And if you're comparing a converted location to one that hasn't converted, that one that hasn't converted hasn't had any disruption yet. And so we're still so early in that system conversion process that we're seeing, certainly, some impact of the disruption. But nothing -- I would say we're not seeing anything that is material in terms of the separation of performance at this point. Operator : And we'll take a follow-up question from Andy Wittmann from Baird. Andrew Wittmann : Great. And I wanted to talk just a little bit more about kind of the top line in both your key businesses. But in rental, Mike, can you comment a little bit on add-stop and the characteristics of the new business that you're bringing in, whether it's tilted to new folks or competitive wins and even a comment on retention? Similar questions really for the First Aid business, I mean, the growth rate is really impressive and I'm just wondering if that's being brought into new customers or is that more of a penetration focus there? Paul Adler : Yes. Andy, on the add-stops, the add-stops metric is positive, but it's typically positive at this time of the year. Nothing really remarkable in it to speak of. Still the main drivers of growth are new business and penetration. So to answer your question specifically about anything changing, not really. It's still been consistent in terms of retention and pricing as well. So no significant changes there. And then, First Aid, yes, again, we were talking earlier about the expectation of that growing high single digits, and it's still a good mix of brand new customers, who value the service and want us to handle the compliance for them and provide a benefit to their employees, but also some good penetration. We continue to evolve in that business to offer more and more ancillary products and services like that safety cabinets and other things that we can put in there and a lot around safety and training. That's becoming a significant part of the revenue base, whether it's a training on materials handling or training and the safety training on CPR. That becomes -- continuously becomes a significant portion of the overall revenue. Michael Hansen : Andy, we're about 18 months from a fairly good sized investment in salespeople in that First Aid and Safety business, if you remember, kind of coming out of the ZEE integration process. And we're just -- we're seeing some real nice productivity out of our new sales partners. Operator : And there are no further questions. I'll turn the conference back over to you, Mike, for any additional or closing remarks. Michael Hansen : Thank you very much for joining us tonight and season's greetings to all. We'll issue our third quarter earnings in March and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude our presentation for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas quarterly earnings results conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Senior VP of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. J. Hansen: Thank you. Good evening, and thanks for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2018. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. In a moment, we're going to share with you our third quarter results, which represent another strong quarter of execution and performance. There's a lot of noise in our results. So we'll do our best to help you decipher the performance of the business. Before diving into the numbers though, we thought it fitting to recognize that yesterday was the anniversary of the closing of G&K Services deal. The past year has been quite transformative for Cintas. Our employees, whom we call partners, including our partners who came to us from G&K, have done some great foundational work over the last year to position us for success going forward. We remain as excited as ever about our future. In early February, we were thrilled to be able to share with our partners a onetime cash payment. The timing couldn't have been better for us given the work done during the past year since March 21 of 2017. As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer, indicated in today's press release, the recently passed U.S. tax reform legislation is good for Cintas, our shareholders and our customers. And again, our success wouldn't have been possible without our motivated and engaged partners, and we were excited to share it with them. Moving on to our third quarter results. Our revenue for the third quarter, which ended February 28, was $1,589,000,000, an increase of 26.6% over last year's third quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 7.8%. The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 6.5%, and the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 10%. Reported operating income for the third quarter of $200 million compare to $192 million in last year's third quarter. However, there are some items worth noting that impacted the comparability of results year-over-year. First, our operating income was reduced $10 million in the third quarter of fiscal '18 and $9 million in the third quarter of fiscal '17 by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K Services acquisition. Second, operating income in the third quarter of fiscal '18 was also reduced by the onetime cash payment to Cintas partners that I just mentioned, which amounted to an expense of approximately $40 million. Excluding these 2 items, our third quarter operating income was approximately $250 million or 15.7% of revenue. This measurement is consistent with the way in which we reported our first 2 quarters of this fiscal year. Keep in mind that operating income includes $12 million of intangible asset amortization expense from the purchase price accounting of the G&K deal and $5 million of incremental depreciation and implementation costs of our enterprise resource planning system, SAP. These 2 items total 1.2% of revenue. Reported net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of $296 million increased 152.9% from last year's third quarter. Reported earnings per diluted share, or EPS, from continuing operations for the third quarter were $2.66 compared to $1.06 in last year's third quarter. Again, there were a handful of items that impacted the comparability of net income and EPS results to prior year : First, fiscal '18 and fiscal '17 third quarter EPS included a negative impact of $0.06 from G&K transaction and integration expenses. Second, fiscal '18 third quarter EPS also included a negative impact of $0.24 from the onetime cash payment to Cintas partners. Lastly, more than offsetting these negative impacts was a significant benefit to EPS of $1.59 from the benefits of the new Tax Act. Excluding these items, to provide better visibility to financial performance, net income dollars increased 24.1% and net income margin was 9.6% compared to 9.8% last year, and EPS increased 22.3%. Note again that net income includes intangible asset amortization expense from the purchase price accounting of the G&K deal and incremental depreciation and implementation cost of SAP. These 2 items, net of tax, total 0.8% of revenue or $0.12. In addition to strong execution on the fundamentals, our third quarter was one of solid progress on 2 important long- term investments : G&K and SAP. The integration of G&K remains on track. We have now closed 60 duplicate operations, which is 95% of the total planned closures. Also, 59% of G&K locations have been converted to the Cintas operating system. This is an increase from 47% at the end of the second quarter. The system conversions are very important as they are necessary for us to achieve numerous operational synergies. These activities helped us in the third quarter to realize about $15 million in synergies, which is in line with our expectations. Regarding SAP, significant advancement continues in our implementation, which remains on schedule. In our third quarter, 24 operations were converted. A total of 79 operations have now been converted to date, which is about 25% of the total planned. As I have previously detailed, we have several third quarter items, including the benefit of tax reform, that make the comparability of our full fiscal year results to prior year complex. Rather than provide full fiscal year guidance, we believe it's more beneficial, for the sake of simplicity, to provide specific guidance for our fourth quarter of fiscal '18. We expect fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $1,625,000,000 to $1,645,000,000. I want to reiterate a point we have made in the past : In our upcoming fourth quarter, we will lap the 1-year anniversary of the acquisition of G&K. For the first time, G&K's growth will be organic as opposed to inorganic. In the fourth quarter, we will report an organic growth rate that is the combination of a strongly growing Cintas legacy business and a significantly sized acquired G&K business that historically grew slower than Cintas and that will have declined year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We expect this lower organic growth rate to be temporary just as it was for our First Aid and Safety segment after it acquired ZEE Medical. With the investment in selling resources having already been made to grow the G&K business, we expect the total Uniform Rental and Facility Services organic growth rate to accelerate as we move through fiscal 2019. For our fiscal 2018 quarter, we expect EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.69. Guidance assumes a fourth quarter tax rate of 24%. We anticipate healthy fourth quarter operating margins in excess of last year's fourth quarter. Note that while the EPS guidance excludes any future G&K transaction and integration expenses, we do expect that these expenses will be incurred in the fourth quarter as we continue to integrate this significant acquisition. We estimate that these expenses will range from $10 million to $15 million. I will now turn the call over to Paul. Paul Adler : Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal third quarter contained the same number of workdays, 64, as the prior year third quarter. However, on a sequential basis, it had one less workday than the second quarter. One less workday in a quarter adds an impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of on a workday basis. Our upcoming fiscal fourth quarter will contain 66 days, the same number of days as the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. We have 2 reportable operating segments : Uniform Rental and Facility Services; and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,284,000,000, an increase of 30.0% compared to last year's third quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 6.5%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.1% for the third quarter compared to 45.1% in last year's third quarter. The reduction in margin is attributable to the inclusion in this year's third quarter of the lower margin G&K business. The margin of the G&K business has continued to decline as the top line has lowered. In addition, we continue to incur the typical conversion costs, which impact margins in the short term. While the assimilation of the G&K business continues at a great pace -- Mike mentioned 95% of duplicate operations have been closed, more work remains. The G&K gross margins will improve to Cintas legacy levels as we further integrate this business and we increasingly realize more of the synergies. We are on track. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $137 million, which was 10.5% higher than last year's third quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 10.0%. This segment's gross margin was 46.9% in the third quarter compared to 44.8% in last year's third quarter, an increase of 210 basis points. The third quarter was another outstanding quarter for this business. Strong new business wins and expanding gross margins are evidence of the value businesses of all types place on having Cintas manage their first aid and training programs to help keep their employees healthy, safe and ready for the workday. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. The Uniform Direct Sales business long-term growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Our fire business, however, continues to grow each year at a strong pace. All Other revenue was $167 million, an increase of 17.0% compared to last year's third quarter. The organic growth rate was 14.9%. All Other gross margin was 41.7% for the third quarter of this fiscal year compared to 41.2% for last year's third quarter, an increase of 50 basis points. All Other gross margin expansion was driven by the higher-margin fire business. While Uniform Direct Sale business growth was strong in the third quarter, note that the business will face some difficult sales growth comparisons in the fourth quarter. Last year's fourth quarter benefited from a significant roll-out of new uniform styles for the pilots and flight attendants of Southwest Airlines. Large roll-outs such as these do not repeat each year as business typically rebrand only every 3 to 5 years or so. The benefit from Southwest last year will be a headwind of about $13 million to this year's fourth quarter revenue. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.9% in the third quarter compared to 28.6% in last year's third quarter. Please note that the onetime cash payment to Cintas partners Mike mentioned earlier was recorded in SG&A. Excluding this onetime payment, this year's third quarter SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 28.4% compared to 28.6% last year. SG&A benefited from improved receivables collections and favorable workers' compensation claims experience. On a year-to-date basis, SG&A, excluding the onetime payment, is up 50 basis points over last year. However, note that current year SG&A is negatively impacted about 100 basis points by intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition and incremental SAP depreciation and implementation costs. We are getting leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs and making good progress on reducing general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue. As Mike stated earlier, our third quarter fiscal 2018 effective tax rate on continuing operations benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. The benefit of the Tax Act to the third quarter EPS was $1.59. Our EPS guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 assumes an effective tax rate of 24.0%. Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock compensation expense realized each period. Our cash and equivalents balance as of February 28 was $152 million, and we had $33 million in marketable securities as of quarter end. Free cash flow in the first 9 months of fiscal 2018 was $464 million, an increase of $200 million or 75% from the prior year period. Capital expenditures for the first 9 months of the fiscal year were $196 million. Our CapEx by operating segment for the 9-month period was as follows : $163 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $21 million in First Aid and Safety and $12 million in All Other. We expect fourth quarter 2018 CapEx to be approximately $65 million. As of February 28, total debt was $2,722,000,000, consisting of $187 million in short-term debts and $2,535,000,000 of long-term debt. At February 28, our leverage was 2.3x debt-to-EBITDA. Overall, our cash flow remains strong, and we expect our leverage ratio to decrease to approximately 2.0x debt-to-EBITDA at May 31, 2018. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll hear first from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Gregory Bardi : This is actually Greg calling on for Manav. Just wanted to hit on G&K first if that's okay. Maybe I missed it, but could you give the revenue and growth rate you saw in the third quarter? And then maybe more broadly touch on any early signs you're seeing from a potential revenue synergy opportunity? J. Hansen: Third quarter revenue was slightly over $230 million, and it was down about 4.7%. I would tell you, Greg, that being able to specifically identify that G&K revenue gets harder and harder as we have, as you heard us say, closed 60 locations and now that revenue is really starting to mix in with the Cintas locations, so getting a little harder and harder to identify. But those were the estimated third quarter numbers. From a revenue synergy standpoint, we think opportunities are going to be there. We are moving somewhat slowly on that because we want to make sure that through the large disruption of closing and system conversions that we maintain a very good customer relationship, and introducing new things to them in addition to that kind of disruption gets to be overwhelming sometimes. So we're moving fairly slowly on that. I would expect it will start to see some benefit in the back half of fiscal '19 and certainly in fiscal '20. But from our standpoint today, early signs are we feel pretty good about that opportunity in the future. Gregory Bardi : Okay. And then from the core Cintas side, I know it's a metric we don't look at quite as much anymore, but maybe some color on what you're seeing from the net add-stops and hiring from some of your existing customers. Paul Adler : Yes, Greg. It's Paul. So the add-stops metric was positive. I think the only thing really of note was that we had some good lift in the dust mats area, carpeted mats. Wet and cold winters with a lot of snow, good precipitation definitely give us a little bit of a lift, but outside of that, nothing significant to add especially in terms of anything in the garment area. Operator : Our next question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : Just following up on the G&K, you mentioned that it was down 4.7% in the quarter. I think last quarter, you mentioned in your guidance $895 million to $915 million for the year. So I'm just wondering, is that still like a good number for the year? Or was this quarter a little bit better than what you're expecting previously? J. Hansen: We have been very pleased with the performance of that G&K revenue block so far, and it was a little bit better than we expected in the third quarter. And I would say we're going to be at around $920 million for the year, which is slightly better than that range that we gave last quarter. And we continue to see very positive things from not just the revenue performance but overall performance. Toni Kaplan : Okay, got it. And this quarter, I guess the legacy Cintas organic growth decelerated for the second quarter to 6.5%. So I just wanted to get a little bit of extra color on sort of what you're seeing in that Cintas legacy business. Like should we expect -- I guess G&K will be inorganic. So of course, the fourth quarter will be even lower. But just on the legacy Cintas business, is there something sort of driving the deceleration? Or is it just that the comps are getting harder? J. Hansen: We believe that the execution and the performance of the business is still very good. We're very pleased with it. And as you probably noticed, we increased our guidance for the fourth quarter as well. So we still feel very good about the performance. Look, in every quarter, there are puts and takes. For the first half of the year, for example, we got a little bit of an energy headwind in the third quarter. Last year's third quarter was very strong. And so there are puts and takes in every quarter, but we're still in a range where we want to be, and we feel like we're operating very efficiently throughout this fiscal year. When you think about our fourth quarter guidance, we effectively raised the bottom end about $67 million and the top end about $22 million, and again, a bit of a signal that we still feel good about the business. And generally speaking, if we hit the top of that guidance range in the fourth quarter, I would expect that the legacy Cintas business may see a little bit of an uptick in organic growth in that fourth quarter. We won't report it that way because we're co-mingling the G&K and the Cintas business, but we feel good about it. Operator : We'll now go to Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Hamzah Mazari : The first question is just if you could give us a sense of how to think about utilization across your facilities. I realize facility capacity is measured locally versus nationally, but maybe just give us some sense how many facilities are at, say, 75% plus utilization. What's underutilized in your platform? I know you're going through a consolidation as well. So just any color where are we, utilization-wise, however you want to answer that. J. Hansen: Sure. Hamzah, as you mentioned, capacity is local, and there are some markets that are reaching their capacity. There are others that have plenty. When we need extra capacity, we will do certain short-term steps before building a fully new facility, like we may add a washer and a dryer to our wash alley. We may bump out our wash alley and make it even larger, and that will add capacity. And we usually do those things as we start to creep up on the capacity, and that allows us to expand the existing capacity. We'll continue to do those things we have in the last several years. But we will also add, I would say, something in the way of 2 to 4 plants per year. We have done that this fiscal year, and I would expect it will continue to do something like that into the future as we -- or if we continue to grow like we have been. Does that answer your question? Hamzah Mazari : Yes, that's very helpful. And then maybe any view? I know it's early days. There's low visibility. But any thoughts on the Trump tariffs and how that impacts your business either directly or indirectly and anything you're hearing from customers, anything you're hearing from your procurement guys? Just any sense, early sense of that. J. Hansen: Well, we didn't fare too well in the market today. I'll start by that. I -- we're not seeing things from our customers yet. That's too early to tell. Certainly, we do have some things that we source out of China. We're keeping our eyes on it and how they may be affected by the list of things that may have a tariff. But I think it's too early to tell because we really don't know what's on and what's not quite yet, so too early to tell. We're keeping our eyes on it. Our goal will be if we do see some things that may be affected into the future, our goal is to do our best to re-source or find efficiencies to offset. And I think we've done a fairly good job of that over the years. Hamzah Mazari : Great. Last question and I'll turn it over. Just any thoughts on how much of your marketplace is self-operated on the uniform side? And any change you're seeing in terms of outsourcing trends? Has that been pretty consistent? Any thoughts there? Appreciate it. J. Hansen: We haven't -- we talked a lot about the no programmer new business. So that is new customers that weren't in a uniform rental program previously. And we haven't seen a change. We're still having success in finding new businesses to put into uniform rental programs, so not much change in our third quarter relative to the previous several quarters. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : Two questions. First one, could you comment on sales force productivity? And obviously, you're progressing nicely through your integration. Could you just talk to some of the developments you've had there and what's left to go and how it's working? J. Hansen: We're seeing some encouraging signs, Scott. Our productivity has improved sequentially through this fiscal year, and that's with quite a few more salespeople certainly than a year ago as we brought on the G&K sales team. So we're seeing some encouraging productivity signs, but certainly, we have a ways to go. We still have productivity improvements to get, and we're confident that those will come over the course of the fourth quarter and fiscal '19. Scott Schneeberger : Great. I appreciate it. Then my follow-up is on CapEx. If my numbers are right, it looks like the guidance reduced by maybe $15 million or $20 million this year. If you could please correct me on that and let me know. And where is that coming from? Is that a pushout? Is there anything changing with SAP? Or if you could tell us where -- if there is a change, where it is occurring? J. Hansen: Yes, I think it's -- more than anything, it's timing. We do have a lot going on in terms of the G&K integration, the SAP implementation. And some projects just tend to get pushed a little bit as we move through those integrations market by market. So I would just call it timing more than anything. Operator : Our next question will come from Judah Sokel with JPMorgan. Judah Sokel : I was wondering if you can give us an update on the 4 buckets that you've talked about in the past of cost synergies, which we had talked about, $130 million to $140 million. Where -- how are we progressing on each of those? J. Hansen: So the -- let me start with the $15 million that we talked about in the third quarter. About half is G&A, and the other half would be in the gross margin. So from a G&A perspective, you probably saw in our third quarter that we're making some nice progress in terms of leveraging and getting that SG&A down from post-acquisition levels. So we're making some nice progress, and we have more to do. So for example, we still have an IT presence from the legacy G&K team as we continue to roll off of that system. And so there will be some additional things to come, but we've made some really nice progress. The other bucket that we talked about are our production bucket. That is the cost of running our facilities. And as you can imagine, we're in the midst of closing a number of facilities and converting. And so while we have set up a lot of those synergies, there is some inefficiency that's going on right now in our third quarter, a little bit in our second quarter, certainly a little bit more in our fourth quarter as we do the things necessary to achieve those. So for example, we're doing a pretty good job of getting those locations closed and eliminating some duplicate labor and other costs. And we'll get more efficient as we move away from the integration market by market. But the production has come along very well, and we still expect the same kind of results that we put out a year ago. From a service perspective, I haven't done much of that heavy lifting yet. That -- as we've talked about in the past, we need to get on the same systems in markets before we can really start to get into route optimization. We've started some of that in some markets. We'll continue to do that in our fourth quarter but likely, even more heavy lifting in the first half of fiscal '19. But indications are we still feel good about capturing those synergies that we talked about. And the last bucket was the sourcing bucket, and we are making progress on that area as well. As you probably know, it takes longer to recognize that because we may be able to get new sourcing and new pricing but it takes a little while to purchase it, [ sew ] it out, get it into our distribution center and get it into in-service inventory and then it starts amortizing, right. So we are making the -- some really nice progress there. It just takes more time to realize it. So all in all, Judah, I feel good about all 4 of those buckets. Judah Sokel : Those are really helpful color. And one other question about the 2019 comment that you guys had mentioned that you expect to see acceleration throughout the year. Is that purely a function of the G&K declines moderating and perhaps switching to growth? Or is that in the core legacy Cintas business also you're expecting some sort of pick-up in that business? J. Hansen: No, more than anything, it's seeing the G&K business begin to level and then start to grow and more than anything, seeing the productivity improve in our sales team that I mentioned a bit ago. Operator : We'll now hear from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Mike, are you seeing a positive impact in the business overall just from tax legislation just from your customers? Maybe any pick-up in hiring or being easier to sell? It's now been approximately 3 months. I was wondering what you're seeing on that side of it. J. Hansen: We're -- Shlomo, we're hearing some anecdotal things that the sentiment is good. I would say from the standpoint of impact to the P&L, probably not much yet. You still have to take the time to sell it and get people into uniform or get the mats out there. And as you know, we're kind of a weekly billing business and it takes a little time to accumulate some of that revenue. And so it just takes a little time. So I would say the impact in our third quarter has not been very significant, but sentiment seems to be pretty good. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So would you expect that to be a lift in future quarters? J. Hansen: I think certainly that if we see our customers spending some of the cash that they are getting from the tax reform, yes, I think that will be a benefit. It's hard to tell how much, but I think that will certainly be a good thing for all of us. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, great. And then could you talk a little bit about just what drove some of the sequentially improved results in the other businesses? Is it -- what's going on in fire safety? Anything in particular that's going on you could call out? Paul Adler : Shlomo, in fire, nothing in particular to call out. I mean, as we mentioned in kind of our remarks, that is a business that has grown very strongly organically for some time now. And the expectation is typically high single digits, about 10%. So as Mike said, sometimes, you have some puts and takes each quarter and there might be a little bit of a volatility but nothing to call out. So it's a good, strong, growing business. And then the Direct Sale business, they did have a very strong third quarter. They did have some nice wins, nothing to the extent of a Southwest Airlines roll-out that I mentioned in my -- in the comments, but still some nice good wins. And truth be told, last year's third quarter was a little light. So they had some nice, favorable comparisons in Q3. And as we've talked about in the prepared remarks, remember that Direct Sale business will have a very difficult comp due to Southwest rolling out last year. Shlomo Rosenbaum : And if you don't mind, just a little housekeeping. What's the pro forma tax rate you're using for the $1.37 EPS number? J. Hansen: It's 32% for the quarter. And so based on where we have -- had guided you previously, there's probably about $0.06 of a tax benefit in that $1.37 that is non-U.S. tax reform related. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So pro forma tax rate and pretax income, you would use 32% to get down to your -- to the $1.37? J. Hansen: Yes. For the quarter only, not year-to-date but for the quarter only. Operator : Our next question will come from Andy Wittmann with RW Baird. Andrew J. Wittmann: Where will I start? I guess, let's talk about the $40 million payment to your partners. I assume that most of that was in the rental segment, but was there any amount that's notable that we should know for our models that was in the other segment? J. Hansen: It was about 2.5% of revenue in each segment, Andy. Andrew J. Wittmann: Okay, okay, 2.5% revenue in each segment, perfect. And then maybe just on the guidance, looking at it another way, it seems like -- well, it looks like if you adjust for the tax rate bump, it gives you about $0.25 by our estimates versus what you would've had previously. And yet, there's a pretty good guidance bump add that you've mentioned. I was just wondering -- it sounds like G&K revenue is ahead of plan. Can you maybe talk, Mike, about some of the other factors that helped you get the upside and maybe the significance of them? J. Hansen: The good news -- I'll start with there are 2 more workdays and that certainly is beneficial, 2 more workdays than in the third quarter, same as last year though. Year-over-year, it's the same. But sequentially, that will help us. Andy, it's continuing to sell. It is working through the integration activities. We're going to get more leverage as we go into that fourth quarter. And we've seen some really nice things in the SG&A area. So I think it's just a lot of the execution along with some healthy revenue. Andrew J. Wittmann: Got it. Maybe my last question is just trying to understand a little bit more detail on the characteristics of your growth in uniform rental. And you guys have answered this question about kind of add-stops, new business versus no programmers and all those things. But one of the questions I wanted to get a sense for you about is specifically on penetration of existing customers. If you were to break up that as a bucket of your gross new sales in the quarter, how significant or how much of the growth rate is based on sales to existing customers in particular, whether it's through cross-sell, upsell and maybe not including pricing? If you could just help us understand how important that is to your growth, that would be helpful. J. Hansen: Certainly, Andy, it's important. It's not as big of a driver as new business and really has never been, but it is important to us. And while we haven't gotten specific in terms of magnitude, quantify magnitude, it is certainly second most to the new business effort that we have. So it's an important factor. We think there are lots of opportunities remaining in that area as -- particularly as we continue to penetrate with things like Carhartt and Chef Works garments and with our Signature Series restroom products. So still a lot of opportunity left but it's an important factor. Andrew J. Wittmann: Maybe my last, last question. I was wondering -- you've been -- you've commented over the last couple of quarters on the pricing environment. You said it's been always competitive but you're getting some. How would you characterize the price that you realized in the third quarter versus what you've seen in the last few quarters? J. Hansen: No change to speak of, remains pretty competitive, but no change from the last several quarters. Operator : And at this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Mike Hansen for any additional or closing remarks. J. Hansen: Well, thank you very much for joining us tonight. We look forward to talking with you again in our fourth quarter call that will happen in mid-July, and have a good evening. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, again, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all again for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Sir, please go ahead. Michael Hansen : Good evening. Thank you for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2018. After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Our revenue for the fourth quarter, which ended May 31, was $1,670,000,000, an increase of 9.1% over last year's fourth quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 5.1%. The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 5.3%, and the organic growth rate for the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 9.4%. Note that the lower rate of organic revenue growth for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was expected and as we have previously communicated, was due to the inclusion for the first time of the acquired G&K Services business and organic as opposed to inorganic revenue. Reported operating income for the fourth quarter was $265 million compared to $177 million in last year's fourth quarter. Operating income was reduced $15 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '18 and $63 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '17 by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition. Excluding these items, our fourth quarter operating income grew 16.4%, resulting in an operating margin of 16.8% compared to 15.8% last year. In March, we gave fourth quarter EPS guidance in the range of $1.64 to $1.69. That excluded G&K integration expenses, and it assumed an effective tax rate of 24%. Against this guidance, fourth quarter EPS was $1.77. Our tax rate was slightly better than the guided 24%, and this resulted in a benefit of $0.04. The remaining beat of guidance was primarily due to higher revenue than expected. We're pleased with these fourth quarter results and our full year performance. Our fiscal '18 results extended our record of success. We have now grown revenue and profit 47 of the past 49 years with the only exception being the two years of the Great Recession. For the eighth consecutive year, organic growth was in the mid- to high single-digit range, and we continue to grow revenue by multiples greater than both gross domestic product and employment. Strong execution on the fundamentals is a hallmark of Cintas, but fiscal '18's achievement was especially noteworthy given that it occurred in a period of extreme change management. While delivering solid returns to shareholders in 2018, we also made significant progress on two important investments, G&K and SAP. The first year of the integration of the largest acquisition in Cintas history required the expertise of every part of the organization, including sales, production, service, global supply chain, IT, engineering, HR and finance. Very important tasks included winning the hearts and minds of acquired employees whom we call partners and earning the trust of acquired customers through our outstanding service. Our partners ran our acquisition playbook and effectively adjusted where necessary. We have now closed nearly all operations necessary to eliminate redundancies, which is 63 operations to date. All G&K locations, 148 in total, have been converted to Cintas operating systems. About 1,500 G&K trucks have been painted and rebranded as Cintas. Important integration work still remains for fiscal 2019, but after our first year of integration efforts, we are still on track for the achievement of our synergy commitments. When we acquired G&K less than 18 months ago, our debt to EBITDA ratio rose to about 3.1 times. Our commitment was to return our leverage to a target of about 2 times in 3 years. We are now there and are thrilled to have delivered on this commitment well ahead of expectations. Fiscal '18 was also a year of tremendous technological change. In addition to moving G&K locations to Cintas systems, we continue to convert our operating system from a homegrown system to that of SAP. And information system conversion is like an acquisition integration in that it requires the involvement of experts from all departments of the company, including operations, sales and corporate support. The conversion of each operation to SAP is an eight month process. Our employees are coached on change management. Data standardization activities are performed. Garments are scanned and inventoried, and employees are trained and certified. Customers are notified of changes to invoice appearance and introduced to improvements in doing business with us because of the technology enhancements. Training and care continue for two months following the go-live date of the new system. A total of 108 operations have now been converted to date, which is about 34% of the total planned. Looking ahead to -- looking ahead, fiscal 2019 will share some similarities with fiscal '18. We will continue to integrate G&K and realize more of the $130 million to $140 million in anticipated annual synergies. We expect to realize $90 million to $95 million in synergies in fiscal 2019 or $32 million to $37 million in incremental synergies. In addition, efforts will continue to convert more operations to the new SAP ERP system. Like fiscal '18, inefficiencies will exist as our partners make further progress on acquisition integration and system implementations while executing on the day-to-day for our customers. However, we expect to extend our streak of profitable growth to 48 out of the past 50 years. We will accomplish that via the solid execution of our -- our shareholders have come to expect. One important area in which fiscal '19 will differ from fiscal '18 is in capital allocation. With $600 million of acquisition debt repaid and our leverage target achieved, we returned to our historical priorities for deployment of cash, which are CapEx, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. We are honored to have been recently included in the Fortune 500 as number 500. As our CEO, Scott Farmer, has stated, this accomplishment is built on our strong sense of culture, principles and values and reflects our strong financial growth, expanding line of products and services and innovative technologies. It's a testament to the hard work and dedication of our employee partners. We're not satisfied with being number 500, though, and our continued progression higher into that ranking starts in fiscal '19. Our expectations for fiscal '19 are for annual revenue to be in the range of $6.750 billion to $6.820 billion. I stated earlier that in our fourth quarter of fiscal '18, we lapped the one year anniversary of the acquisition of G&K. For the first time, G&K's revenue was organic as opposed to inorganic. This resulted in a lower organic growth rate due to the combination of a strongly growing Cintas legacy business and a significantly sized G&K business that historically grew slower than Cintas. We expect this lower organic growth rate to be temporary just as it was for our First Aid and Safety segment after it acquired ZEE Medical. With continued investment in selling resources, we expect the total Uniform Rental and Facility Services organic growth rate to hit bottom in the first quarter and then strengthen as we move through fiscal '19. We expect fiscal '19 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $7 to $7.15. Let me make a few comments about this EPS guidance. It assumes an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Keep in mind that this tax rate can move up or down from quarter-to-quarter based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation benefits. The guidance assumes a diluted share count for computing EPS of 114 million shares. It does not assume any G&K integration expenses. However, we do expect to incur these in the range of $15 million to $20 million in fiscal '19. The guidance does include the impact of a change to our Cintas partner retirement policy in which the retirement age and tenure requirements were reduced. This change results in a shorter time period over which future stock-based compensation grants will be amortized. It is a non-cash impact, and it is expected to increase stock-based compensation expense by roughly $20 million in fiscal '19. And lastly, the guidance also includes the impact of adoption of the Accounting Standard Update 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers. With the adoption, we expect the following. Fiscal '19 revenue will be negatively affected by roughly $8 million along with the loss of the incremental operating margin associated with that revenue. SG&A, however, will benefit from the capitalization of sales rep commission payments and the subsequent amortization of those commissions over the expected service period of our contracts. This is also a non-cash impact, and we expect the net benefit to be roughly $16 million to $19 million. Overall, these last two non-cash items included in guidance will both be recorded in SG&A and generally will offset each other to have only a minor negative impact. Before I turn the call over to Paul, I'd like to say thank you to Phillip Holloman, who is retiring from Cintas this month. Phillip has been with Cintas for 22 years and has been our President and Chief Operating Officer for the past 10 years. In our press release last month in which Scott Farmer thanked Phillip for his many contributions, Scott said, those of us who have had the privilege of working with Phillip know that Cintas is a better company because of him, and he will be missed. Thanks again, Phillip. Phillip's retirement has led to several other leadership changes at Cintas. Scott Farmer announced the promotion of Todd Schneider to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer with the responsibility of leading all of our business divisions. Todd has been with Cintas for 29 years and has been our Rental division President and Chief Operating Officer for the last 5 years, leading our largest business through a very successful period and most notably, leading us through the integration of G&K. Scott also announced the promotion of Mike Thompson to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Administration Officer. Mike has been with Cintas for 24 years and has been Cintas' Chief Information Officer for the last five years, most notably leading us through our SAP conversion. Mike will continue to lead our IT efforts and will also be responsible for our global supply chain and our safety and engineering groups. These changes are part of our normal succession planning process, and as we move into our fiscal '19 year, we remain as excited as ever about the future of Cintas. I'll now turn the call over to Paul. Paul Adler : Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal fourth quarter contained the same number of workdays as the prior year fourth quarter. Looking ahead, there will be no workday differences next year as each quarter of fiscal '19 contains the same number of workdays as the comparable quarter of fiscal '18. We have 2 reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,342,000,000, an increase of 10.1% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 5.3%. As Mike stated, the organic growth rate was negatively impacted by the inclusion of G&K and organic as opposed to inorganic revenue for the first time. We expect the organic growth rate to hit bottom in the first quarter of fiscal '19 and strengthen as we move through the fiscal year. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.0% for the fourth quarter compared to 44.6% in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. While we continue to experience the inefficiencies that are customary with an acquisition integration and an ERP system implementation, we are realizing the expected cost synergies, which are benefiting our margins. These synergies plus better-than-expected revenue also enabled us to overcome an almost 20 basis point increase in energy expenses. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $147 million, which was 9.9% higher than last year's fourth quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for this segment was 9.4%. This segment's gross margin was 47.0% in the fourth quarter compared to 44.5% in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 250 basis points. The significant amount of margin expansion was fueled in large part due to the realization of synergies from the ZEE Medical acquisition. With the synergies now realized in full, we expect margin expansion to continue in fiscal '19 but at a normalized rate. The fourth quarter was another outstanding quarter for this segment. Organic growth continued to be strong and was benefited by penetration of existing customers and national account wins. The solid revenue growth plus expanding gross margins are evidence of the value businesses place on having Cintas manage their first aid safety and training programs to help keep their employees healthy and safe. The future of the first aid business segment remains bright. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. The Uniform Direct Sale business long-term growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multi-million-dollar account. Our fire business, however, continues to grow each year at a strong pace. All Other revenue was $179 million, an increase of 1.8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. The organic growth rate was 0.2%. The fire business organic revenue growth rate was double digits. However, the strong performance was offset by a difficult revenue comparison for the Uniform Direct Sale business. In last year's fourth quarter, Uniform Direct Sale revenue included the rollouts of new uniform styles for the pilots and flight attendants of Southwest Airlines. Large rollouts such as these do not repeat each year as businesses typically rebrand every 3 to 5 years. The benefit from Southwest last year was a headwind of about $13 million to this year's fourth quarter revenue. All Other gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.8% for last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 80 basis points. All Other gross margin expansion was driven by the fire business. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the fourth quarter compared to 28.6% in last year's fourth quarter. SG&A benefited from favorable workers' compensation claims experience. In addition, we are getting leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. The effective tax rate, excluding G&K integration expenses, was 22.1%. Our EPS guidance for fiscal 2019 assumes an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock compensation benefits in each period. Our cash and equivalents balance as of May 31 was $138 million. Free cash flow in fiscal '18 was $692 million, an increase of $201 million or 41% from the prior year period. Capital expenditures for fiscal '18 were $271 million. Our CapEx by operating segment for the year was as follows : $225 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $28 million in First Aid and Safety, and $18 million in All Other. We expect fiscal '19 CapEx to be in the range of $290 million to $320 million. In the fourth quarter of fiscal '18, we repatriated about $110 million of international cash. We used the funds to pay down debts and to buy back stock. In the quarter, we purchased about $90 million in Cintas stock, and $410 million remain on the share buyback authorization approved by the Board of Directors. As of May 31, total debt was $2,535,000,000. At May 31, our leverage was 2.1x debt to EBITDA. As Mike stated earlier, when we acquired G&K less than 18 months ago, we committed to return our leverage to a target of about 2 times in three years. We are pleased to have delivered on this commitment well ahead of expectations. We are excited to have returned to our historical priorities for deployment of cash, which are CapEx, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Hamzah Mazari : Good afternoon. Thank you. The first question is just on consolidation in the space broadly. I know you've sort of outlined cost synergies. Maybe if you could touch on -- there's been another uniform deal in the space. Could you maybe touch on the revenue side? Do you expect pricing to get better in the space post-consolidation? I realize it's a local business, so there may be some nuances there. So maybe if you could just touch on that and then how to think about G&K revenue synergies? Michael Hansen : Sure. So from the standpoint of pricing, the pricing environment, I would say, hasn't changed much in the last 90 days since we spoke last. And quite honestly, I don't expect that the consolidation that has happened will have much of an impact on the pricing environment. It's still a very competitive environment. We face legacy like competition as well as other catalog type competitors, and so that's not going away. So I don't think that's going to have much of an impact on the pricing environment. From the standpoint of the revenue synergies, we're moving cautiously as we have as we've talked about in the past. But we have begun to introduce some of the products where we can, where we have converted systems or where we have integrated routes into Cintas locations. And while it's early, and we haven't seen any notable impact, it's anecdotally positive so far. So I would say, as we continue to move through this year, we've got a lot of integration activity left, and we're going to continue to introduce Cintas products and services to those customers. But I would not expect much of an impact at this point in time. Hamzah Mazari : Okay. And then just on the SAP, I know you sort of gave color on the integration of the SAP and time line. But maybe you're not ready quantitatively, but qualitatively, should -- once SAP is implemented, should we expect that 28% of sales SG&A run rate to come down materially? Or how are you thinking about sort of benefits of SAP maybe just qualitatively if you want to address that? Michael Hansen : Yes. I think we'll see once we get through that implementation effort, which we expect to be by the end of fiscal '20. We do expect some expenses to roll off, certainly, those that are part of the integration and implementation effort. So we will certainly see some benefit from that in fiscal '21. But more than anything from that system, we like the information and the power of that information. And we're not necessarily looking for a significant cost reduction. What we are looking for is more opportunity to make our selling team more productive. So how can we create warmer leads with better information? How can we use that information to be more directive in the way we approach our customers with our various products and services? So we're not looking necessarily for a significant SG&A reduction. We really want to help our selling partners become more efficient. Hamzah Mazari : Okay. Just a follow-up. I'll turn it over. Any updated thoughts on the tariffs and how that impacts you either directly or indirectly through customer demand? Michael Hansen : From a direct standpoint, we have -- certainly have some impact like hangers, but overall, it has not been significant. From an indirect standpoint, and when I say indirect, I mean from the vendors -- from our vendors, it remains to be seen how they will be impacted and how that might in turn impact us. We're certainly keeping our eyes on that, but we need a little bit more time for that to play out. From a customer perspective, too early to see much of an impact. Hamzah Mazari : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : Hi, good afternoon, guys. Hamzah Mazari : Hi, Toni. Toni Kaplan : So you mentioned a couple of times now you've hit your gross leverage target in this quarter. Your capital priorities are returning to historical ones. How should we think about the level of share repurchases this year or if you want to just talk directionally as sort of what the algorithm would be in that? Or - and then also just with tax reform, how should we -- should we expect 5x to be above the historical average that you've been running at? Michael Hansen : Well, we -- as Paul mentioned, CapEx is very important to us, and we will make sure we spend and invest in the business. We also will likely be more aggressive than we were in the last 2 fiscal years in acquisition activity. From the standpoint of share repurchases, we have a $410 million -- we have a $500,000 authorization, where $410 million is remaining. And I would say that we're going to continue to do what we have done in the past, and that is be opportunistic about the way we use that. And so that -- I'm not ready to say whether that will increase where we have historically been. But I would say our expectation is to get back to something of that historical type of environment. Toni Kaplan : Terrific. And I know it might be difficult to parse this out. But could you give us some color on what kind of G&K growth is incorporated into the '19 guidance? Michael Hansen : That is very difficult to parse out. And you may have noticed when we gave guidance, we didn't include any specific G&K information because it's pretty difficult to take the business that is so co-mingled into our legacy business. But if you kind of think about the revenue guidance and you just make an assumption that it's flattish, that opening guidance is pretty much in the range of that 5 to 6.5 where we've been in the last few years. So we think that's right where we want to be. That -- we believe that's our -- that's kind of our sweet spot as we opened the year and feel good about it moving into this first quarter. Toni Kaplan : That's helpful. And just lastly, historically in the fourth quarter, you've given revenue growth by product within the uniform business. Is that something that you'd be able to provide for us today? Paul Adler : Yes, Toni. We do have that, and this is the mix of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment. Uniform rental was 50%. Dust control is 17%. Hygiene is 14%. Shop towels are 5%. Linen is 10%, and then catalog revenue was 4%. Toni Kaplan : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from George Tong with Piper Jaffray. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. You've indicated that, over time, G&K's revenue growth can approach Cintas' historical revenue growth in the uniform rentals business. Can you think of any potential structural barriers that might prevent G&K organic growth from reaching your historical levels? And maybe talk a little bit about the initiatives you have in place to improve G&K's growth outlook over the near to intermediate term. Michael Hansen : I don't see any roadblocks. And George, as we move in to this year, you -- it's hard to think about that business as being separate at all. It's -- so many of the locations have been absorbed into legacy Cintas locations or have traded volume. So it's really hard to look at it separately. However, as we were working through the integration of last year, one of the biggest pieces was coming out of the closing of that deal. We had a sales team at G&K that had been -- had a tough environment, and we wanted to pull them out of their positions so that we can train them, get them to understand our systems, our products and services. There certainly were open positions that we had to fill, and that has gone very well. But as we've talked about in the last several quarters in our business, when you lose that new business momentum for a number of quarters, it takes a little bit of time to reverse that trend. We have done a very good job of training our new salespeople. We have seen the productivity tick up slightly each quarter throughout fiscal '18. And so the thing that will get us back to the Cintas like levels of growth will be a combination of those sales partners being more and more productive and our ability to penetrate the G&K customers like we do with all of our other Cintas customers. So as we mentioned, we expect our first quarter organic growth to be somewhat similar, maybe slightly lower than what we reported here in this fourth quarter for our rental business. But we expect to see some improvement as we then go through the year to the point where fiscal '20, I would expect, we'd be back to our historical like levels, barring any change in the macro environment. George Tong : Got it. That's very helpful. And then on the topic of revenue synergies and cross-selling, I know it's still very early days. But can you provide a progress report on how cross-selling initiatives are progressing? And what, in your view, is the longer-term revenue opportunity from bundling? Michael Hansen : Well, we are -- and I'll speak to our total business now, not just G&K. But we have opportunities. When we first sell a new account, we don't normally sell everything. And so we continue to look for ways and opportunities for our drivers, who we call SSRs or service sales reps. Our SSRs and our salespeople, we look for opportunities for them to penetrate existing customers. And we're getting better at that, but we can always improve and especially when it comes to getting First Aid and Safety and fire into our uniform and facility services customers. So we're continuing to work on ways to improve the efficiency there in the -- or while we are waiting for SAP to come. And once we get SAP, we do believe that, that will make the visibility for all of our people better, and this should allow us to improve that penetration even more. George Tong : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is actually Greg dialing in. First, just wanted to hit on the G&K guided synergies. Can you talk to the buckets that are showing up in the $35 million or so synergies you expect to realize in '19? And then what are the other buckets that are going to be seen in year three and year four? Michael Hansen : Sure. I think we've talked a lot about the 4 buckets in the past. And as we move into year two of that integration, I would expect that we will get more production synergies. We did a lot of that heavy work in fiscal '18, and we're still not quite as efficient as we want to be in our plans, but we're moving through that. And I would expect that production is a big component. We will do a lot of route optimization. And while we have only just begun that, that's going to be the largest activity that we have going on in fiscal '19. So we'll start to see some of those routing benefits. And when I talk about routing benefits, what I really mean is improved fuel utilization. We are not looking to eliminate routes. What we're really looking to do is make all of our routes more efficient and give them -- give our SSRs more time with our customers. But that's going to be a big project, and there will be -- we will start to see some of that benefit. We have already gotten a lot of G&A benefits, and we still have some more to go. But that will be a lesser component in year 2 than the production impact. And then we'll start to see some sourcing synergies, but I would expect more of those to be in that year 3 and 4. So thinking about that prioritization, I would expect production to be the largest piece followed then by those other 3 where we're touching now on the routing and the sourcing and also getting a little bit more incremental G&A. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to quickly ask how you guys are thinking about inflation pressures and what's embedded in guidance. And how you're thinking a rising labor and raw material cost backdrop, how you think about your ability to pass on that pricing to customers? Michael Hansen : Well, when we think about the economy as we stand today and looking forward from today, we feel like it's a positive environment. The activities are good. Our team has been fairly successful in both selling new business and in penetrating. And so it's a positive environment. There are certainly those things that you mentioned that we're keeping our eyes on. Certainly, the tariff uncertainty is a wildcard, and as we -- as I was mentioning a little bit earlier, the indirect pieces of those, we're keeping our eyes on, but again, it's a wildcard about how that'll impact us. From an energy perspective and fuel perspective, we have modeled that we will see about a 20 basis point increase in fuel in fiscal '19, and we're seeing that already in June in our prices at the pump. And from a labor perspective, we certainly are starting to see the tightening of labor. It's not affecting us widespread, but it certainly is an impact. And we're keeping our eyes on how do we manage the best we can and be as efficient as we can. And one way to do that is to really work on our partner retention. That is very important for us, and it certainly makes this tighter labor market easier to deal with if we can retain our current partners. That's very important to us. But those things are certainly starting to creep in. They are included in our guidance, but we're -- those are things to keep our eyes on. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. All very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. Good afternoon. Just following up on that last question, it looks like cotton's gotten expensive again. Could you remind us -- you considered synthetics last time. You weathered the storm pretty well, though, when those prices increased a few years ago. Could you just remind us how maybe this time compares to last time and how you think about that? Michael Hansen : Yes. I don't think we've seen the spikes that we saw last time quite yet, but in any event, cotton is something that just takes a long time to get into our P&L. When you think about the standard garment that we have, certainly, the fabric is a component of that. A bigger component is the labor. And you also have things like trim and freight into our distribution centers. But certainly, the fabric is a component of that, and cotton is a component of that fabric. So when you break it all down, it's not a significant amount of the cost, but there is an impact. But when we see these spikes, in order for it to impact our P&L, it's got to be a long time of that spike. In other words, it has to last through the production of our garments, the shipping of those into our distribution center, sitting in our DC for return, then getting out into our rental locations where it begins to amortize generally over 18 months. So in that first month of shipping into the rental location, we see 1/18 of the impact. So as you can imagine, that cotton has to spike and stay elevated for quite a while before it has a real meaningful impact, and we haven't seen any of it yet. Scott Schneeberger : You guys have referenced that the low watermark for the organic growth progression is going to be in the first quarter. I don't know if you're comfortable getting into more detail, but just curious how it might compare to fourth quarter and kind of the cadence of next year. Michael Hansen : Yes. I think it's going to be slightly -- from a -- I'm speaking from a rental perspective now. I think it's going to be lower than this fourth quarter, but then in the second quarter, should see a move upward and followed by the second half of the year that it's getting closer to the 5.5 to 6 level. But we're a ways from there. I would expect, if the economy continues to perform like it is, I would expect that we should be near that top of that guidance that we gave, and that should play out quarter-by-quarter in the way I mentioned. Scott Schneeberger : Appreciate that. One more similar question, kind of housekeeping. You talked about the full year tax rate guidance and that it would fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. Any rules of thumb on any particular quarters that we should follow being above or below that just for the modeling purposes? Michael Hansen : Yes. I think that's a good question, Scott. I would expect from an EPS quarter-to-quarter perspective, we're going to have -- I mentioned the change to our retirement policy and an increase in our stock-based compensation. We're going to see a good chunk of that in our first quarter, and so it's going to pressure our first quarter margins. Because of that, we also get a benefit, a greater benefit on the tax side of things. So I expect that our first quarter tax rate will be quite lower than the remaining 3 quarters, all of which will probably be closer to that 24% like range. Scott Schneeberger : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann with RW Baird. Andrew Wittmann : Thanks for taking my question, guys. I was just looking at the guidance, and it looks like bridging between EPS and revenue that somewhere in the low 16s is the EBIT margin assumption that you have implicit in your guidance. I guess, with the moving pieces of roughly $35 million of cost synergies that you're expecting this year, it does look like you're putting up some incremental margins. But I was just wondering how you expect this year to play out versus your normal expectation for around 30% incremental EBIT margins. Is that what's implied here, Mike? Michael Hansen : Implied from the low end to the high end is certainly margin improvement, operating margin improvement, and I would say, I think of it in -- a little bit higher than you had said. I think you had said in the low 16s, I would put it more in the mid-16s and at the high end, maybe even a little bit higher than that. So ex synergy, still some nice margin improvement at the top. Now Andrew, we talk about 20% to 30% incremental margin, and clearly, with all of the integration and implementation work that we have, this is not a normal year. And I -- inclusive of all of that, that incremental is going to be a little bit different this year than we would normally think of. When you think about incremental -- when you think about the inefficiencies of the implementation and the integration, when you think about a little bit of a higher energy number, it's not your normal incremental year certainly. Andrew Wittmann : Got it. So just in terms of like the in-specific integration costs, if you will, like the things that you weren't able to back out, now that you're more than a year into owning G&K, does that become a slight tailwind as well because you're like not relabeling garments? Or is there still or maybe more of those types of costs that are in your guidance? Michael Hansen : More of those types of costs are in the guidance. So when you -- I mentioned earlier that we're -- one of the heavy projects is the route optimization. So I'll give you an example of a market route optimization. In a market where we've got Cintas facilities and G&K facilities that will remain open, we're going to take a look at all of the customers in that marketplace, and we are going to then take those customers in that marketplace and effectively reroute them to make all of our routes in that marketplace more efficient. Now we are certainly cautious because the -- our goal through this process is to minimize the disruption to the customer. And so we always have to keep that in mind, but we will make those routes more efficient. And sometimes, that means moving the processing of certain customers from one location to the other. And when we do that, that means we have to pull garments out of one location and transport them to the other location. That receiving location then has to rebarcode all of those garments, enter them into the system, and they have to do a little bit of that production integration all over again. That's an important part of what we're doing. And we're going to be cautious about it because, again, we're not -- we want to make sure that we don't disrupt the customer or minimize that. And again, we're not looking at a route reduction. We're looking at a route efficiency opportunity. But as you can imagine, moving those garments in between those facilities creates, again, the same kind of inefficiency that we talked about last year. Andrew Wittmann : I wanted to ask one final question here, and that's just regarding kind of the revenue trends in the core rental segment, specifically, just getting some subjective comments from you on the level of sales force productivity, particularly those G&K folks who stayed with you that are now more accustomed to the suite of products and services that you're selling as well as get some sense from you about the level of retention that you're experiencing in your customer base today, any comments on add-stop? Or the level of no [ph] programs would also be welcome. Michael Hansen : Let's see. That was a lot, Andrew. From the retention standpoint, look, we talked about it all year long and it's been better than we expected. And we are very, very pleased with that. Again, the legacy G&K business was a very good business. They took care of their customers well. We've continued to do that, and we try to make that disruption of the integration as minimal as -- of a disruption as we can. And that has -- that's led to some real nice retention. From the legacy salespeople standpoint, look, we -- they have some very good selling skills. It's just more a matter of making sure they understand our environment, our systems, our products and services and our expectations. And that can take a while to retrain and ramp up. But we like -- as I mentioned, we like the trend that we've seen in each quarter in fiscal '18, and we're encouraged by what we've seen and encouraged by the opportunity that we have moving forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicolaus. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, thank you. I don't usually ask questions about M&A. But given some of the commentary you made about being more selective or opportunistic in share repurchases together with the significant capacity that you now have on the EBITDA side. I was just wondering if -- when you are looking, and I'm sure you're paying more attention to deals that are coming your way, should we expect more of the same in terms of companies more in the uniform rental business? Doesn't seem like there's a ton at least in the first aid side or is there an adjacency or something that you guys are entertaining as well? Michael Hansen : We would love to continue to be acquisitive in our rental business, in our First Aid and Safety and in our fire businesses. We like all of those opportunities, and we will have an opportunity to be more aggressive in fiscal '19 than we have been in the last few years. And those acquisitions are important to us. Would we look for a different type of opportunity? It depends on the characteristics of the business. And it can -- can it help us continue to grow? And can our current customers take advantage of that new offering? A lot of things that we would have to take into account and the value would have to be at the right place. Having said that, if those things do happen, we'll absolutely be aggressive in looking at it if we feel like it is the right opportunity. Shlomo Rosenbaum : So is there anything like particular out of the wheelhouse that you think would surprise us? Or really, hey, you feel like this as a company that wants to stick to its knitting and that's what we should expect? Michael Hansen : Well, Shlomo, we -- when we think about our business, we think about the opportunity to create value to over 1 million businesses that we currently serve and many more that we don't currently serve. And that value can come in the way of image, safety, compliance. And so there are a lot of different ways that we can provide benefits to businesses, and that also then allows us to kind of expand what we currently do, both in our current businesses and maybe then in some type of new offering. In the past, we have moved from the rental business to a first aid to a fire to document management to deep cleaning. There have been opportunities, and we've taken advantage of those. And again, if those kind of opportunities exist, we would certainly love them. I don't know if some of those kinds of services would be surprising to any of you. That I can't answer. But we're not satisfied with simply staying in our swim lanes and not being aggressive in terms of adding value to our customers and to other prospective customers. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan Securities. Andrew Steinerman : Hi. Mike, looking back at the fourth quarter in terms of uniform rental organic revenue growth, could you tell us how G&K did versus the Cintas space? And did the upside in rental revenue growth come from G&K better than expected or the Cintas space? Michael Hansen : Andrew, it's really hard to pull it apart, but our expectation was that we certainly still did see shrinkage in that G&K base but likely a little better just based on the top line, likely a little bit better than we had expected. I would say more of the beat of our guidance was our legacy business, and that's operating very, very well even in the midst of lots of moving parts within those locations because of the integration. I can't give you a specific number though, Andrew. Andrew Steinerman : So did you think that G&K declines narrowed from the third quarter declines? Because you did give us third quarter declines of mid-single digits. Michael Hansen : Yes, I would say if I had to -- I am guessing. I would say it's fairly similar to that third quarter number. Andrew Steinerman : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Tim Mulrooney : Good afternoon. Can you guys hear me okay? Michael Hansen : Yes, I can. Tim Mulrooney : Hi. Just a couple of questions here. So with non-pharma employment continuing to grow, I'm sure you guys are benefiting from that to a degree. In thinking about new customer growth, are there any areas, other end markets or regions where you see particular strength? Michael Hansen : Well, we -- first of all, I would say it's been broadly a positive environment. But we talk a lot about health care in the last few years, and health care remains an exciting opportunity for us for many of our products and services. And that industry vertical continues to grow at very good levels. But I would say, generally, Tim, it's been a fairly broad performance, and we're real pleased with it. Tim Mulrooney : Okay. Thanks. And then on a dollar basis, can you share with us how much acquisitions added to both the uniform rental and other segments in the quarter? Michael Hansen : Let's see. From a dollar perspective, in the quarter, it's, let's call, at about $53 million for rental and a very small number for the others, less than $5 million, only really a couple million dollars. Tim Mulrooney : Got it, okay. And then with SAP, you've converted 34% of the base so far with plans to be complete in fiscal 2020. Where do you guys expect to be by the end of 2019 if you're willing to share? Michael Hansen : We've got a lot of moving pieces, and I would say we're going to make significant progress. But I don't have a schedule in front of me, and I don't know that I'm -- I want to get to that level of specificity just simply because it changes quite often. It changes based on what we've got going on in each market from an integration standpoint, from a customer perspective. And as I mentioned a few times, our goal is to minimize customer disruption. And so that might mean moving a little bit from one market to another. So it's hard to pinpoint that, and I'd rather not. Paul Adler : But Tim, I guess, I would add from like a modeling perspective, like we don't anticipate that in fiscal '19, the SAP expenses, anything much different than fiscal '18, so we don't expect the expense to be a headwind. Tim Mulrooney : Okay, that's essentially what I was looking for. Two more quick housekeeping ones, guys, number one, the change to the retirement policy. Did you say higher stock comp would impact by $15 million to $20 million in 2019? Michael Hansen : I said $20 million roughly. Tim Mulrooney : Roughly $20 million. And you said that a big piece of that, Mike, might hit in the -- will hit in the first quarter. How should I think about modeling that? Is it most of it in the first quarter? Half? Any detail would be helpful? Michael Hansen : I'm not -- I don't want to get into the very specific level. I don't have it in front of me nor do I want to get into that level of detail. But in our first quarter, we are generally wrapping up our fiscal -- our prior fiscal year compensation plans. And so that's generally when we provide the grants. And because of that, that is when a lot of the activity happens. But I can't get into the level of detail, that level of detail that you want. Tim Mulrooney : No, that's still helpful. One last one. Did you say shares outstanding of 114 million in 2019? Michael Hansen : We did, yes. Tim Mulrooney : So you were at 111 million at the end of the fourth quarter. Is that increase related to the change in the retirement policy? And then if you -- could you share the cadence of how should we think about that through the year? Michael Hansen : We were over 111.5 million. We're modeling a little bit higher. Tim, when our stock performs as well as it does, the effect of diluted securities really starts to rise. And while there aren't additional shares out there, the effect of those securities increases. So that's why we're seeing that number at that 114 million level. Operator : All right, gentlemen, there are currently no further questions in the queue. Michael Hansen : Okay. Thank you very much, and we will be with you at the -- near the end of September for our first quarter results. But thank you for joining us, and have a great rest of your summer. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference, and you may now disconnect.",

Baird Dan Dolev - Nomura Securities Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Hansen : Good evening. Thank you for joining us. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2019. After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Our revenue for the first quarter, which ended August 31, was $1,697,000,000, an increase of 5.4% over last year's first quarter. The organic revenue growth rate which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 5.2%. The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 4.9%, and the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 9.0%. Note that the lower organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was expected and as we have previously communicated, was due to the lapping of the G&K Services acquisition. We expect this organic growth rate to increase during the remainder of fiscal 2019. Reported operating income for the first quarter was $265 million compared to $249 million in last year's first quarter. Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was negatively impacted by $19 million in stock-based compensation expense related to a change in the Cintas retirement policy, in which the retirement agent tenure requirements were reduced. Slightly offsetting this was a $5.7 million benefit from lower commission expense, resulting from the adoption of the Accounting Standard Update 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers. We discussed both items on our July earnings call, when we provided our initial fiscal 2019 guidance.  Lastly, operating income was reduced about $5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and about $4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition. Excluding these items, our first quarter operating income grew 12%, resulting in an operating margin of 16.7% compared to 15.7% last year.  Interest expense was $6 million lower in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to last year due to debt reduction of about $300 million. Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 of $212 million, increased 31.9% from last year\u2019s first quarter net income from continuing operations of $161 million. EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 were $1.89, an increase of about 30% from the EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 of $1.45. Net income and EPS from continuing operations were positively impacted by a lower effective tax rate in this fiscal year\u2019s first quarter, compared to last fiscal year\u2019s first quarter, primarily from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Net income and EPS from continuing operations were negatively impacted in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018 by $0.04 and $0.03 respectively from integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition. As a result of our first quarter results and forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are increasing our annual guidance. We are raising our revenue guidance from a range of $6.75 billion to $6.82 billion to a range of $6.8 billion to $6.855 billion. And EPS from continuing operations, from a range of $7 to $7.15 to a range of $7.19 to $7.29.  Note the following regarding EPS guidance; it assumes an effective tax rate for the full fiscal year of 21.7%, which is the same rate we provided in July for our initial fiscal 2019 guidance. Keep in mind that this tax rate can move up or down from quarter-to-quarter, based on discrete events including the amount of stock compensation benefits. The guidance assumes that diluted share count for computing EPS of 113.5 million shares, it does not assume any G&K integration expenses. However we do expect to incur these in the range of $15 million to $20 million for the full fiscal year. As our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Scott Farmer was quoted in our earnings release, we are pleased with the start to the fiscal year. Our employees and we call partners continue to execute at a very high level, while also making significant progress on the integration of the G&K acquisition and the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system. I'll now turn the call over to Paul. Paul Adler : Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal first quarter contain the same number of workdays as the prior year first quarter. Additionally, there\u2019ll be no workday differences the remainder of the fiscal year, as each quarter of fiscal 2019 contains the same number of workdays as the comparable quarter of fiscal 2018. We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services, and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in all Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on routes. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.37 billion, an increase of 4.8% compared to last year's first quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 4.9%. As Mike previously stated, the organic growth rate was negatively impacted by the lapping of the acquired G&K business. However, we believe that the organic growth rate has reached the bottom. We expect the organic growth rate to increase during the remainder of the fiscal 2019. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.7% for the first quarter compared to 46.1% in last year's first quarter. We were starting to see cost pressures in a few areas. Energy expense was a headwind of about 20 basis points. We are experiencing wage inflation in certain areas and we\u2019ve seen some cost pressures on our hangers, which largely are sourced from China. Keep in mind, that all of these are considered in our updated guidance. In addition as previously disclosed, we continue to experience the inefficiencies that are customary with an acquisition integration and an ERP system implementation and these activities weigh on margins in the short-term. With all that being said though, we were pleased with the gross margin expansion on a sequential basis of 70 basis points. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $153 million, which was 9.1% higher than last year's first quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 9.0%, which was a noteworthy accomplishment against the difficult comparison of prior year first quarter organic growth of almost 12%. This segment's gross margin was 47.9% in the first quarter compared to 47.5% in last year's first quarter, an increase of 40 basis points.  Organic growth continue to be very strong and was benefited by penetration of existing customers and national account new business. The combination of the solid revenue growth plus expanding gross margins are confirmation of the value that businesses in all sectors of the economy place on having Cintas manage their first aid, safety and training programs to help keep their employees healthy, safe and productive. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. Our Fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct Sale business growth rate are generally low single-digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multi-million dollar account. Uniform Direct Sale however is a key business for us and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units. All Other revenue was $169 million, an increase of 6.6% compared to last year\u2019s first quarter. The organic growth rate was 4.0% and was driven by 8.9% organic growth in the fire business. All Other gross margin was 42.9% for the first quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.5% for last year's first quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. Both Fire and Uniform Direct Sale realized expansion of gross margins. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29.7% in the first quarter compared to 30.2% in last year's first quarter. A 110 basis point increase in stock-based compensation expense was more than offset by lower labor, workers compensation, medical and other expenses. We are getting leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of 12.0% benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. In addition, it was positively impacted by stock-based compensation. Our EPS guidance for fiscal 2019 as soon as an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve build and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock compensation benefits in each period. Our cash and equivalents balance as of August 31st was $118 million. Cash flow remained strong and we expect fiscal 2019 operating cash flow to exceed fiscal 2018. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $64 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows : $51 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $9 million in First Aid and Safety and $4 million in All Other. We expect fiscal 2019 CapEx to be in the range of $275 million to $300 million. As of August 31st, total debt was $2,535,000,000 and consist entirely of fixed interest rate debt. At August 31st, our leverage was 2.0 times debt to EBITDA. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : Good morning or good afternoon, I should say. Paul Adler : Hi, Toni. Toni Kaplan : Free cash flow was a little bit lighter than what we were expecting driven by working capital. Could you just give us some color on some of the drivers that were impacting working capital this quarter? Paul Adler : Yes, Toni, this is Paul. I think from a cash flow perspective, we did have some timing issues in this quarter, but as we just mentioned in our prepared remarks and looking at our forecast for the remainder of the year, we believe that our operating cash flow will be strong and even exceed prior year. So there are some timing things and accounts payable, et cetera. But the one thing to note that I can tell you about from the balance sheet is inventory we\u2019ve had an increase in new goods inventory, we have a new distribution center. It\u2019s a facility services distribution center that we just started up very recently due to the need to support that strong Facility Services growth. And so typical with a start-up of a new distribution center, we\u2019ve had a build of inventory. And once that DC continues to run as expected, it\u2019ll burn that inventory off and that\u2019ll come down. So again, nothing structural in terms of the organization that has us concerned about cash flow, just some timing effects, and we believe it will be strong at the end of the year. Toni Kaplan : Okay, great. And you mentioned the wage inflation and costs pressures from the energy and from hangers in China. And I know you mentioned that in the guidance. But could you give us a sense of, if you\u2019re expecting these to continue through the whole year, if you\u2019re expecting them to get worse or better. And if you can give any color of how much is in the guidance that would be helpful too? Thank you. Paul Adler : If you put all of those together Toni, it's probably somewhere in the 50 to 60 basis points in the quarter. And we generally expect that to continue through the rest of the year. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. Operator : And our next question is Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, it's Daniel on for Scott. Could you guys speak to the synergy progress and help us think about the narrative for a scenario where you could exceed the synergy target for the full year? Paul Adler : The integration efforts continues and we're very pleased with it. We are continuing to -- well, we're really getting into the route optimization process. So that'll take -- we're working on that most of the year. We've closed all of the redundant plants. But still some inefficiency about getting all of the plants that accepted new volume still working through inefficiencies and getting them back to kind of a normal operating environment.  And so we continue and we\u2019re very pleased with where we are and we talked about in July, getting an additional something in the way of $32 million to $37 million of synergies on top of the $58 million that we got last fiscal year and we\u2019re very confident that we will see those. What can get us above the synergy target in total of $130 million to $140 million, I think more than anything that would come from the sourcing opportunity, I think that\u2019s the biggest opportunity for outperformance.  So in other words, can we take the volume from G&K and incorporate that into our supply chain and translate that into larger sourcing savings than we have modeled. I am not ready to say that we can do that, but I think in answering your question, if we were to outperform that\u2019s likely where it would come from. But generally the integration continues, just as we expected and we\u2019re very pleased with it. Unidentified Analyst : Got it, thank you. On capital allocation, could you just provide us an update on how you think about that on a go forward basis. I mean, you had a decent quarter in buybacks, so if you can discuss capital allocation on a go forward basis, please? Michael Hansen : Yes, I would say the capital allocation is similar to pre-G&K acquisition philosophy and that is we want to grow organically and we\u2019re going to invest in the business in the way that, that we need to in order to continue to grow, that means CapEx will be important for us both in adding plant capacity, adding route capacity and other system investments. So that\u2019s important to us. We love tuck-in acquisitions and acquisitions that are in our current businesses. And so we\u2019ll continue to look for those kinds of opportunities in our Rental business, in our First Aid and Safety business and in our Fire business. And so we\u2019re -- I would expect that we will return to being aggressive after taking for the most part fiscal 2017 and 2018 off, because of the G&K deal. We have raised our dividend for every year since we went public. I would expect that we\u2019ll evaluate that and that\u2019s very important to us. And then if we have additional cash and we have an opportunity to be opportunistic with that cash, we will execute on the buyback program. We did a little bit of that in the first quarter and I would say that if we feel like there are opportunities to use that program, we\u2019ll continue to do that into the future. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from John Healy with North Coast Research. We\u2019ll take our next question from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Hamzah Mazari : Good afternoon, thank you. My first question is just, how do you think about just underlying operating leverage in the business post G&K. I know you highlighted some costs pressures, some ERP distraction or disruption, maybe that\u2019s natural when you have that sort of thing. And then obviously some of the integration around G&K. But, how do you think about sort of natural operating leverage in the business post G&K relative to sort of legacy Cintas? Michael Hansen : Well I\u2019m going to speak to the whole company -- to the whole business now including G&K. Now we\u2019re going to continue to work on the synergies, but our goal has generally been incremental operating margins in the 20% to 30% range and that will continue going forward. We believe that as we continue to grow, we\u2019ve got very large investment in capacity and route structure and we have leveraged that in the past very well and we expect to continue to do that into the future, especially as we continue to sell to existing customers and to get more revenue per stop. So, there really isn\u2019t a change in the way we view that opportunity going forward, but in this current fiscal 2019 year just as in fiscal 2018, we do have the integration efforts going on and we have the SAP efforts going on. And that will create a little bit more of a let's called it a bumpy ride in terms of that incremental margin, but our philosophy and our belief in that incremental margin and leveraging going forward has not changed. Hamzah Mazari : Okay, great. And just any updated view on the China Tariffs? I know there is not a lot of direct exposure. I know you mentioned hangers, but anything you're hearing from your customer base or how you think this plays out in terms of your portfolio on an indirect basis? Michael Hansen : Hamzah I think it's too early to tell. We haven't seen much direct impact yet, other than we called out hangers in a -- it's not a significant amount, but it is something that\u2019s starting to creep in. Aside from that, we haven't seen much direct or indirect impact yet. I think we just need to see more play out. Hamzah Mazari : Okay. And just a follow-up, I'll turn it over. On the ERP, did you sort of mention how to think about benefits of that system once it's in place longer term? Michael Hansen : We talked a little bit about the power of the information that we'll get from that system. There will certainly be some costs that can be eliminated particularly the implementation costs. But really we look at that system from the power of the information and how that can make us more efficient, our sales people more productive more targeted in the way that we sell both prospecting, but even more to existing customers. And so we think the power is in the efficiency of the selling process, the productivity and kind of that revenue opportunity as we move into the future. Hamzah Mazari : Great, thank you. Operator : And we now have a question from John Healy with Northcoast Research. John Healy : Thank you. Wanted to ask just a little bit about the cadence of organic growth and the expectation there. I know you guys have said that this would mark the bottom the 4.9%. But when I kind of look at the guidance for the year, it assumes probably the number approaching 6% towards the end of the year. And we just kind of curious to know how quickly you think that steps up from here? Michael Hansen : Yes, John I think the first quarter we're very pleased with that quarter. As you can tell from maybe the -- what we did with the revenue guidance, we beat our internal plan by a little bit. We have some real nice execution, we saw a nice uptick in our sales rep productivity. And we also saw some nice performance in the first quarter of selling Cintas Facility Services products into our acquired G&K customers.  So we liked what we saw in the first quarter and what you're seeing in our guidance raise is a little reflection that we continue to feel good and be encouraged by the rev productivity, as well as seeing some benefit from the penetration opportunities in our G&K customers. With that being said, we expect an uptick in the second quarter. And as I mentioned in our July call, that second half of the year we expect -- I mentioned in July, we expected that to be in the 5.5% to 6% range and certainly by our guidance increase, we still feel very comfortable about that. So I would expect the second half of the year to be fairly good performance. John Healy : Great. And then just one question on SG&A, if I kind of back out the $19 million or so with the stock comp kind of the one-time hit there, very good SG&A kind of management. And I was just curious if there were kind of any onetime items that maybe helped the cause there a little bit or maybe kind of what was going on in the SG&A line that really allowed you guys to outperform that? Michael Hansen : Well, we are in some really nice leverage as Paul mentioned and the synergy opportunities there are certainly taking effect. And so we've seen some lower -- we've seen a lower labor number and along with that then comes a little bit of a lower medical workers comp kind of number. And so we feel really good about the structural piece of G&A. And I would say that there aren't any significant one time call outs. It's just I would say it's more than anything pretty good performance and cost control. John Healy : Great. And just one final question for me. Any updates on kind of the ERP implementation any bright spots or any thoughts on timing there? Paul Adler : John, the SAP implementation continues to go very well. And it continues to go as scheduled. Last quarter, back in July, we had I don't know maybe 34% of our operations have been converted to the SAP system. That's now up to about 42% or a little bit more at this point in time. So, it's going very well, it'll still extend into fiscal 2020. Just to give you the some color on this implementation and the scope of it, we've had 3,000 routes impacted and converted by SAP, 235,000 customers. So it's a big undertaking, but everything is going very well. Nothing significant to update you on. John Healy : Great, congrats on a great quarter, guys. Michael Hansen : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital. Greg Bardi : Hi, this is actually Greg calling in. Just wanted to hit on the tight labor market a little bit more both in terms of what you're doing to attract talent given the low unemployment rate. And then maybe from a customer perspective, if you're seeing any benefit in terms of net new sales from hires? Michael Hansen : So from a labor standpoint, the pressure that we see the most is in our plants. And so the number one thing that we are doing is working on partner retention and we want to make sure that we are very competitive in the wages, in the benefits that we provide a great working environment and our retention is very good. When we grow however, we do need to go and find additional labor and finding additional labor has been a little bit more challenging and we\u2019re recruiting certainly aggressively from the standpoint of looking at trade schools and recruiting fairs and other types of things. But it really begins with partner retention. That\u2019s the most important thing for us.  From the standpoint of the new business, I believe your question was the productivity from new hires our sales people. We, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we\u2019ve seen a nice uptick in our sales rep productivity and we really like where we\u2019re headed. We are not back to pre-G&K levels yet. But we really like where we\u2019re headed and the performance has been good and that gives us some confidence to raise our revenue guidance, like I mentioned. Greg Bardi : Okay. And then on the rule 2014-09. I think last quarter, you talked about a $16 million to $19 million benefit for the full year. Is that still the expectation? Michael Hansen : It was about $5.7 million in the first quarter and I would say it\u2019s probably going to be a little bit on the higher end of that range and we\u2019ll update you as we go through the year. Greg Bardi : Okay, thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from George Tong with Piper Jaffray. George Tong : With Goldman Sachs. So I guess, first question around cross-selling, can you talk about the extent to which your structural organic growth will change as your cross-selling and penetration opportunities increase with the G&K deal? And then secondly, how does the SAP timelines impact your ability to achieve those cost penetration synergies? Michael Hansen : Well, the impact on organic growth, I would say is going to be fairly subtle. In other words, just like with our own business penetration takes some time and it\u2019s not something that we rush into with any of our customers. So it's going to be a bit of a subtle improvement but it's certainly is something as I mentioned a few minutes ago that gives us confidence to raise our guidance a little bit this year. And I would expect that that will continue into the future. It does certainly the system conversion certainly does have an impact on that conversion. Now all legacy G&K locations are on Cintas operating systems. And so that allows us to really get into and start that process, which we have started in this certainly more in earnest in the first quarter. I think as we move forward, the system conversion will just like it is with all of our business. There is going to be some disruption market-by-market, but the good news is we're not converting the entire company at one time. It is a market-by-market conversion. And so that disruption is not going to be significant from quarter-to-quarter. But I don't think that's going to have much impact on our ability to penetrate. It is going to have a little bit -- that system conversion is going to have a little bit more impact on the timing of route optimization, but that's a little bit of a different topic. George Tong : Got it, very helpful. And then on the topic of margins, can you discuss your thoughts around reinvesting your cost synergies, whether the expectation is to flow through 100% of the cost synergies you've outlined from the G&K acquisition, or are you going to be reinvesting a portion of the synergies back into the business to drive growth. Michael Hansen : Well, we're going to invest the way we need to invest in order to make our locations as efficient as possible. Now our intention is that that will not require a significant amount of that 130 to 140 in cost synergies to be reinvested. But there certainly will be investments from quarter-to-quarter to make sure that we are maintaining our equipment that we are staffed properly, et cetera. So I don't -- we don't have an expected number that we are going to reinvest, it's going to be part of our CapEx and part of our operating margin going forward. But certainly there is investment that will happen. George Tong : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann with R.W. Baird. Andrew Wittmann : Great, thanks. Mike, just digging into the guidance to be helpful for everyone. Maybe if you could just talk about the guidance raise that you put out there. How much of it was just passing through what you got in 1Q? I mean, clearly there is you've talked about the revenue and that's very clear. But was tax here in 1Q a little bit better than you expected is that the pass through or has your balance of the year forecast changed? You gave us a lot of the inputs there the one question I think specifically for the balance of the year, that would be helpful to get your view on the margins given some of the headwinds that you called out. Michael Hansen : Yes, the first quarter tax rate was just a little bit lower than we expected. But as we mentioned in our guidance comments, our full fiscal year tax rate of guidance of 21.7% is the same that we gave you in July. So from a tax perspective, the guidance really didn't have -- really wasn't affected by that. It's the same tax rate in July as we gave you tonight. We feel good about the first quarter. The performance was pretty strong. And we feel good that with the growth coming in Q2 through Q4, we certainly do see some real nice opportunities to increase operating margins certainly year-over-year as we move through the last three quarters. So I would not attribute any of it to taxes, it's really more about can we continue to gain synergies and can we continue to leverage the business and get the real nice growth margin that we expect? That help? Andrew Wittmann : Yes, it sounds like -- yes it does help. It sounds like there, that it's operating maybe you got the revenue guidance upside here and then it looks like that\u2019s going to flow through to the margins. So it looks like -- it sounds like there is a core operating lift here to the numbers, the share count didn\u2019t change substantially, tax didn\u2019t change substantially, revenue is up and that flow through the EPS. Is that kind of another way to summarize it? Michael Hansen : Yes, if you think about the operating margins for Q2 through Q4 last year, the average was right about 16% with this guidance for the remaining three quarters, we expect that we\u2019re going to beat that 16% and be into the high 16% range. So we expect some nice operating margin improvement as we move through the year. Andrew Wittmann : Okay, that\u2019s super helpful. So then just talking on a couple other things maybe for peoples models here, with the new stock compensation accounting that you\u2019re doing here, it was running in the kind of just sub $30 million range per quarter now $46.2 million, is that a good run rate and same thing with the intangible amortization associated primarily as presumably with the sales commissions now being capitalized and amortized. Is this rate of around $33.5 million, a pretty good run rate for the balance of the year on those two items? Michael Hansen : Yes, great question Andy. From an amortization standpoint, yes. With the accounting change, that commission expense does run through the amortization now. So, you -- that\u2019s a pretty good run rate, keep in mind that\u2019s going to be offset down in working capital and the prepaid expenses line, you\u2019ll see a big increase there and that offset will continue through the rest of the year as well. So, net-net the operating cash flows aren\u2019t really impacted much by this change in accounting. So that\u2019s the rev rec change. From a stock-based compensation, that $46 million that you see in the first quarter is loaded with that $19 million impact that we mentioned earlier. And so that is not a good run rate, you would take out a fairly good chunk of that, probably most of the $19 million to get to a better run rate for the rest of the year. That $19 million is kind of a change where we expense -- we accelerate the expense of certain stock options and restricted shares related to Cintas partners who have attained retirement agent tenure. And that\u2019s going to generally occur in the first quarter, when we do -- when we provide our grants. Andrew Wittmann : Yes, got it, because if you exclude the full 2019, then you\u2019re almost back to the historical level that you\u2019re running at. So it really does seem like it\u2019s pretty heavy in this quarter then pretty de minimis for the balance of the year, right? Michael Hansen : Yes, that\u2019s correct. Andrew Wittmann : Okay. And then just one other thing to clarify, can you talk about the number of shares that were repurchased in first quarter and maybe the total amount of the average price that was paid for them? Michael Hansen : Under the buyback program, we repurchased about 400,000 shares at an average price of $201.20 and that totaled about just over $80 million. We have right about $330 million left on our authorization. Andrew Wittmann : Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Dan Dolev with Nomura Securities International. Dan Dolev : Hey guys, can you hear me? Michael Hansen : Hi, Dan. Yes. Dan Dolev : Hey guys. Nice job on the quarter. I\u2019ve got two quick questions, organic revenue in the rental business was strong, it was a ted weaker than what we were modeling. I know you were about 5.2 versus 4.9, I know you\u2019re not giving the breakdown anymore, but could you maybe give us like a sense of what the GK part was. And I am sorry if you mentioned it already and we missed it, you were down mid-single-digit, I think in the last two quarters. So what was the -- I am trying to figure out where the weakness was in our model, versus your results? Michael Hansen : Yes, Dan, we did not provide a G&K number, because as we mentioned back in July, it is now so comingled with the Cintas business that it\u2019s just too hard, it\u2019s really too many assumptions to try to build into that number. So I am not going to be providing that. This is -- this 4.9 is right where we internally expected, maybe a little bit better than what we expected. And we feel real good about that performance both of the let's call it standalone G&K locations, as well as standalone Cintas locations. And the sales reps that are selling around those. But just simply because it's so comingled for all of the locations that we've closed and we've merged accounts and into various Cintas locations, it gets really difficult to report on the entire block of business. Dan Dolev : No, I understand that\u2019s fair. And then my follow-up is on the energy you called out the 20 basis points energy headwind. I know in prior years you were also talking about whenever there is a headwind to cost there's also a tailwind to revenue. Can you maybe specify if there is a -- if that was also accompanied by a tailwind to organic revenue and rental? Thank you. Michael Hansen : Yes, those things don't happen necessarily at the exact same time. I -- this is -- we are seeing a fairly healthy energy sector. It's not back to where it was from a few years ago. But it is a healthy sector, it I wouldn't say that it's outperforming the rest of the business at this point. Dan Dolev : Got it, thank you very much. Nice results. Michael Hansen : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Michael Hansen : If there are no other questions, thank you for joining us tonight. We will issue our second quarter fiscal 2019 earnings in December. Thanks for joining us, and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Hansen : Thank you and good evening. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas\u2019 Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our second quarter results for fiscal 2019. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company\u2019s current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Our revenue for the second quarter, which ended November 30, was $1.718 billion, an increase of 7% over last year\u2019s second quarter. The organic revenue growth rate which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was also 7%. The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 6.6%, and the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 10.2%. Since the announcement of the G&K Services acquisition nearly 2 years ago, we communicated our expected trajectory of the acquired revenue and its impact on Uniform Rental and Facility Services growth rates. We have discussed that the organic revenue growth rate would reach bottom in the first quarter of this fiscal year, due to the lapping of the G&K acquisition, and we expect the organic growth rate to accelerate during the remainder of fiscal \u201819. Our second quarter rental organic growth rate of 6.6% rebounded as expected from the first quarter\u2019s rate of 4.9%. In fact, this organic growth rate of 6.6% exceeded our internal expectations. We have seen our sales rep productivity reach pre-acquisition levels, and we have seen good performance in penetrating legacy G&K customers, particularly in the hygiene space. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal \u201819 of $775 million increased 8.2% from last year\u2019s second quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 45.1% for the second quarter of fiscal \u201819 compared to 44.6% in the second quarter of last fiscal year. Uniform rental and facility services gross margin as a percentage of revenue improved to 45.3% from 44.7% in the second quarter of last fiscal year. Gross margin improved in the quarter and year-to-date despite some cost headwinds we cited on last quarter\u2019s earnings call, including wage inflation and higher costs for certain commodities. Reported operating income for the second quarter was $275 million compared to $235 million in last year\u2019s second quarter. Operating income was negatively impacted by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition by $7.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201819 and $13.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201818. Excluding integration expenses, our second quarter operating income grew 14.2%, resulting in an operating margin of 16.5% compared to 15.5% last year. Net interest expense was $4 million lower in the second quarter of fiscal \u201819 compared to last year due to debt reduction. Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal \u201819 of $243 million increased to 76% from last year\u2019s second quarter net income from continuing operations of $138 million. Diluted EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal \u201819 were $2.18, an increase of about 76% from the EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal \u201818 of $1.24. Net income and EPS from continuing operations were positively impacted by a lower effective tax rate in this fiscal year second quarter compared to last year\u2019s second quarter, primarily from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Net income and EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal \u201819 benefited $0.47 from a gain on the sale of a cost method investment. Also net income and EPS from continuing operations were negatively impacted in the second quarter of fiscal \u201819 and \u201818 by $0.05 and $0.07 respectively from integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition. Excluding these special items, our second quarter EPS from continuing operations were $1.76 compared to last year\u2019s EPS from continuing operations of $1.31. We\u2019ve provided these figures in a table in today\u2019s press release. As a result of our second quarter results and forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are increasing our annual guidance. We are raising our revenue guidance from a range of $6.8 billion to $6.855 billion to a range of $6.87 billion to $6.91 billion and EPS from continuing operations from a range of $7.19 to $7.29 to a new range of $7.30 to $7.38. Note the following regarding the EPS guidance. It assumes an additional $2.5 million to $3 million of interest expense from last quarter\u2019s guidance due to having some commercial paper. It still assumes an effective rate of 21.7% for the year. This is the same rate guidance as last quarter. It assumes a total diluted share count for computing EPS of 112 million shares. It does not assume any additional G&K integration expenses. However, we do expect to incur these in the range of $18 million to $22 million for the full fiscal year. As our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Scott Farmer was quoted in today\u2019s press release, we are pleased with our progress on the integration of the G&K acquisition and the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system. We are on track to achieve another year of solid revenue and earnings growth. And additionally, we continue to generate strong cash flow and commit to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. As a reminder on December 7, we paid an annual dividend of $2.05 per share, an increase of 26.5% over last year\u2019s annual dividend; and through the end of our second quarter, we purchased $447 million of Cintas stock under our buyback authorizations. I will now turn the call over to Paul. Paul Adler : Thank you, Mike. Please note that our fiscal second quarter contained the same number of work days as the prior year second quarter. Additionally, there will be no workday differences the remainder of the fiscal year as each quarter of fiscal \u201819 contains the same number of work days as the comparable quarter of fiscal \u201818. We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.  Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segments includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers en route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.390 billion, an increase of 6.3% compared to last year\u2019s second quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 6.6%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.3% for the second quarter compared to 44.7% in last year\u2019s second quarter, an improvement of 60 basis points. Energy expenses as a percentage of revenue was 2.4% equal to last year\u2019s second quarter. We are pleased with the gross margin expansion this quarter and year-to-date and our ability to overcome wage inflation increased commodity costs such as for hangers which are sourced mostly from China and the inefficiencies that are customary with an acquisition integration and an ERP system implementation. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segments includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment\u2019s revenue for the second quarter was $153 million, which was 10.3% higher than last year\u2019s second quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 10.2%. This segment\u2019s gross margin was 48% in the second quarter compared to 46.9% in last year\u2019s second quarter, an increase of 110 basis points. Organic growth continued to be very strong and was benefited by penetration of existing customers and national account new business, solid revenue growth and expanding gross margins are confirmation of the value that businesses in all sectors of the economy place on outsourcing to Cintas, the management of their first aid, safety and training programs to help keep their employees healthy, safe and productive. Our fire protection services and uniform direct sale businesses are reported in the all other category. Our fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. Uniform direct sale business growth rates are generally low single-digits and are subject to volatility such as when we install a multimillion dollar accounts. Uniform direct sale however is a key business for us and its customers are offing significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units. All other revenue was $174 million, an increase of 9.3% compared to last year\u2019s second quarter. The organic growth rate was 6.9% and was driven by 14% organic growth in the fire business. All other gross margin was 41.2% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.1% for last year\u2019s second quarter. Improvement in the fire business gross margin year-over-year was more than offset by lower gross margins in the uniform direct sale business. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.6% in the second quarter compared to 29.1% in last year\u2019s second quarter. In the second quarter of fiscal \u201819, it was a benefit of $6.1 million from lower commission expense resulting from the adoption of the Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 revenue from contracts with customers. We discussed this on our July earnings call when we provided our initial fiscal \u201819 guidance. In addition to this benefit, we are getting good leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. Our EPS guidance for fiscal \u201819 assumes an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock compensation benefits in each period. Our cash and equivalents balance as of November 30 was $88 million. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $73 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows : $58 million in uniform rental and facility services; $10 million in first aid and safety; and $5 million in all other. We expect fiscal \u201819 CapEx to be in the range of $270 million to $285 million. As of November 30, total debt was $2.710 billion, $2.536 billion is fixed interest rate debt and $173 million is variable rate commercial paper. And November 30, our leverage was 2.1x debt to EBITDA. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions. Operator : Well, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Good evening gentlemen. First broader question obviously is, -- just curious obviously you have seen the market reacting in a fearful manner. Just curious from what you are hearing from your customers, any signs of things slowing down or any signs of worry based on what you are hearing and seeing there? Mike Hansen : No, Manav. I think from based on our results, which we believe are pretty good, we have seen a pretty good economic environment for the last quarter, and we are not hearing signs of slowdown right now. And I would suggest that our guidance is pretty strong as well and reflects confidence that we are going to finish the year pretty strong, so no. Manav Patnaik : Okay. And then on the G&K side, you talked about making some progress, I guess on the revenue synergy side, especially in the hygiene area. I was just hoping you could help maybe quantify or give some color there and how we should think about what the future opportunities there are? Mike Hansen : Well, we haven\u2019t quantified that specifically other than to say certainly that Cintas percentage of hygiene revenue is greater than G&K\u2019s was prior to us acquiring them. We are making some nice progress on that. I don\u2019t have a specific number to share with you, because many of the accounts are kind of blended in, but we certainly know that we are getting some traction there, and we like that restroom product opportunity. We like this substituting our entrance mats for theirs. We think there is still an opportunity in the future for Carhartt garments and other things, but making some progress so far and we like what we have seen. Manav Patnaik : Alright, got it. And then just last question, just moving pieces on the energy side with obviously the oil prices down, any color on how we should think of that or if you\u2019ve factored that -- some of that in your increased guidance today? Paul Adler : We have assumed that we may still have just a slight touch of pressure for the rest of the year, even though we didn\u2019t have any in the second quarter. It\u2019s hard to predict what that\u2019s going to look like for the second half, but right now we haven\u2019t really changed our outlook and that was to be up slightly in the second half of the year. Manav Patnaik : Alright. Thanks, guys. Operator : And next will be Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Just looking at the guidance, this quarter you bought back just under $370 million of stock and in the back half of the year that should be a pretty nice help to you just given the lower share count from that. I am calculating somewhere around, call it $0.08. You beat consensus this quarter, I know that\u2019s not necessarily your internal target, but let\u2019s just say you beat by at least a couple of cents there, and then obviously you mentioned the higher interest, so maybe $0.02 from that as an offset, but basically a $0.10 guidance raise sort of implies to me that either maybe there is some conservatism there or just trying to get a sense of -- I know you just mentioned that you are expecting a good back half of the year, but like basically, why not raise by more? Sorry for the longwinded question. Paul Adler : No problem. Toni, the low end of our guidance now is higher than the high end of our guidance last quarter. You are right on it in terms of the second half of the year buyback impact. But Toni, the second half of the year, last year we did operating margins of 16.3%. The guidance that we have provided would suggest the high \u2013 mid-to-high 16%, so there is still going to be some nice margin improvement in the second half of the year. The revenue is looking very good. That was a pretty good increase as well, where the low end of the range is higher than our previous \u2013 I am sorry the low end of the range is higher than our previous high end of the range. We think it\u2019s a pretty nice second half of the year. And if we can achieve that guidance, that\u2019s a pretty darn good year with margin expansion, continued G&K integration, SAP integration, and increasing organic growth. Toni Kaplan : Okay, great. And then just one more on buybacks, just given you have 744 authorization remaining in your program, just given where the stock has been trading recently and you just did a lot of buybacks in this past quarter like how should we be thinking about sort of your views on timing of repurchases or your \u2013 going forward? Thank you. Mike Hansen : Well, our remaining authorization is a little bit over $800 million, it\u2019s about $860 million. We did run out a previous authorization during the quarter. We expect it to continue to have pretty good cash flow. We obviously think that the stock price today is an opportunity, but we also like our leverage level, we\u2019re at 2.1 times, that\u2019s right at our target. And I would suggest that we\u2019re going to continue to be right around that level unless we see something different change, something new come about. We certainly have seen it to be a buying opportunity though, and I think that there\u2019s been certainly an overreaction to our stock in the last 90 days. Toni Kaplan : Thanks. Happy holidays. Mike Hansen : Thank you. You too. Operator : And our next question will come from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Gary Bisbee : Hey guys, good afternoon. I guess the first question, just last quarter you talked about the second half of the year getting back to 5.5% to 6% organic revenue in rentals, obviously you blew right through that, and you\u2019ve taking the guidance up. But as we look at it, it appears like the comps get easier on a year-over-year basis. Is there anything that would lead to any deceleration from that or was there anything that was a benefit this quarter? Just trying to think if this is a good run rate in the near term? Mike Hansen : Well, when we think about this quarter, we think about the impact of better sales rep productivity than we initially expected, so I don\u2019t see that changing much. We also talked about the penetration opportunities with all of our customers remains pretty strong. So that guidance range that we gave is something in the way of 6% to the low 7%, and we think that\u2019s a pretty good range for us to be in. That\u2019s right in our sweet spot. Gary Bisbee : You \u2013 on the last couple of calls, you\u2019ve mentioned the national accounts opportunity of First Aid and Safety. Is that \u2013 I don\u2019t remember hearing you mention that a lot over the last few years. Is that a newer opportunity or just something that you\u2019re calling out now and I guess, I\u2019ve always thought as much \u2013 mostly a local business, what are you doing on the national account front? Mike Hansen : It\u2019s not necessarily a new opportunity. It is one that we have started to talk about and we love the opportunity and it is the same as you might think in rental, where we have \u2013 we have the ability to provide large multi-location customers with a consistent Safety \u2013 First Aid and Safety Program and that\u2019s important to these large customers. It allows them to track their locations a little bit better, to understand their compliance on a more consistent basis. And so we\u2019ve got an offering that not many others can provide and that has become a real nice growth opportunity for us in the business, and one that we started to call out a little bit more. Gary Bisbee : Great. And then just on the tax rate, can you help us flush out what sort of the statutory rate or the normalized rate post-tax reform now that we\u2019re almost a year into that? And how much is the tax rate benefiting from that equity comp accounting change of year and a half ago or so? And I guess, I\u2019m just trying to think over the next few years, what could the tax rate go up to if that accounting change benefit around the equity comp were to flatten out? Mike Hansen : Yes. It\u2019s a real good question, Gary. We certainly with the new accounting guidance, we\u2019re going to see a little bit more fluctuation in our tax rate. I \u2013 we expect it to be in a 24-ish type of a percent range. And again that can move now, not all of that difference from 24% to 21.7% is the equity comp, but it certainly is a good chunk of that. If that turns around, we could see it get closer to 24% and in some cases may even get higher than 24%, but that\u2019s kind of where we see a steady range. And what you saw in the second quarter of 24.2% roughly is a quarter without a big stock compensation benefit like you saw in the first quarter. Gary Bisbee : Great. And then if I could just sneak one other. Is there any update on that accounting change benefit for this year, I think you said 16 to 19, the higher end of 16 to 19, is that still a good run rate? Thank you very much. Mike Hansen : The benefit I think Paul called that out, it was $6.1 million in the quarter. Gary Bisbee : For the year [Multiple Speakers] \u201818 [ph] still \u2013 Paul Adler : Yes, in that range. Mike Hansen : I think given that it\u2019s been what 11 in the first half of the year, it\u2019s probably going to be closer to that type of 20 to 22 type of a range. Gary Bisbee : Thank you very much. Happy holidays. Mike Hansen : Thanks. You too. Operator : And moving on, our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Hamzah Mazari : Good evening. Thank you. My first question is just on cross-selling as well. Maybe if you could just frame for us how many customers are buying multiple services from you today versus sort of historically, and where does that number go through, or what can it go to, any thoughts on penetration there? Mike Hansen : Yes, we don\u2019t have those numbers to share with you, Hamzah. But we think there\u2019s certainly is a big opportunity there. As we\u2019ve talked in the past, the biggest penetration is with our uniform rental and entrance mat products. But all of our other products would then be under 20% penetrated, and we certainly think that we can get above 20% with many of those. So we still have a lot of run rate. And we \u2013 that certainly has been beneficial to the growth over the last few years. Hamzah Mazari : Yes. Got it. And then just on First Aid, one of your competitors said recently that they are going to get into that market. Just maybe frame for us, how sustainable is that 10% organic growth number and sort of the competitive dynamic you see in First Aid today just sort of update us there? Mike Hansen : Sure. We \u2013 when we think about that business, we like the high singles and low doubles digits in terms of organic growth run rate and do we think it\u2019s sustainable, we do, certainly in the next \u2013 for the next several years, absent a big change in the macro environment. You know in this business the biggest competition is what we might call in the rental business the no programmer or the customer that\u2019s doing it themselves, there are still many of them out there and we believe we\u2019ve got a great value to provide to them. So we do think there are many opportunities out there for our service and we think there\u2019s a great value in our ability to deliver that compared to the do-it-yourself [sic] and the catalog purchasers and that kind of thing. So we like the \u2013 we love the business. We like the organic growth rate. We think that can continue. Hamzah Mazari : Great. And then just last question, you talked about buybacks, your debt is pretty low on leverage sort of 2.1. How are you guys thinking about M&A? Do you have too much on your plate with the synergies and ERP or are you sort of ready to look at M&A maybe in a different vertical? Any thoughts on M&A? Thank you very much. Mike Hansen : We are looking at M&A, we are ready, and if \u2013 the thing about M&A is, we can\u2019t always predict when those opportunities come along, and so we want to make sure that we are ready and we\u2019re looking at \u2013 we\u2019re looking in our \u2013 certainly in our rental business, in our First Aid and Safety business and our Fire business, if we can find tuck-ins or even larger than tuck-in opportunities, we will certainly take a look at them. We think there is a lot of long-term value in that kind of investment. Hamzah Mazari : Great. Have a very good New Year. Thank you. Mike Hansen : Thanks. You too. Operator : And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman : Hi. When you mentioned what was driving the strength in rental organic revenue growth, you mentioned penetration of existing accounts and some national account wins. I was wondering if you just give us directionally the other typical drivers of revenue growth, how was retention year-over-year, is net realized pricing accelerating at all, and, of course, just a quick comment on add-stops? Mike Hansen : That was led by our new business as it usually is, but we\u2019ve seen some real nice productivity out of our sales team. That sales team also as we\u2019ve talked about over the last several years, that sales team also sells into existing customers and that\u2019s been going very well also. And so that has helped to the historical net add-stop metric that we talk about in our industry. It certainly has been positive from the standpoint of getting some benefit from our sales team. Retention is right where we want it to be and it\u2019s as good as it\u2019s been. It\u2019s in the mid 90% range and has not changed a bunch over the last couple of quarters. And pricing remains favorable pricing environment. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s changed much in the last several quarters, but still a pretty good environment nonetheless. Andrew Steinerman : Okay. And just as a quick follow-up, just clarify what you meant before when sales productivity is back to pre-merger levels. Did you mean that both the Cintas legacy sales force and now you inherited G&K sales force were back to Cintas levels of sales productivity, I didn\u2019t quite understand if you meant both? Mike Hansen : Well, let\u2019s be clear, it\u2019s one sales team now. Andrew Steinerman : It is. Mike Hansen : And so we measure it altogether and it is higher combined than it was pre-acquisition. So in other words, our new partners and our recently hired partners from that deal, they have made some real nice progress and are certainly being productive in a way that we want them to be productive. Andrew Steinerman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And the next question will come from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. You\u2019ve indicated that you\u2019re assuming a touch of pressure for the rest of the year from energy. Can you elaborate on whether you\u2019re internally planning for oil prices to stay at current levels as you think about the demand impact and how you expect gross margins to be impacted by energy? Paul Adler : Well let\u2019s talk about the pressures, the cost pressures that we\u2019ve cited. From an energy perspective, it was flat in the quarter year-over-year and we\u2019re expecting it to be just up slightly. We don\u2019t get specific enough to provide you an oil price, but we think it will be up slightly for the back half of the year. We have talked a little bit about the labor. We\u2019re seeing that in pockets as we\u2019ve said over the last several quarters, and that\u2019s certainly is within our numbers for the first half of the year and it is contemplated in our guidance for the second half of the year. So the great news is, we\u2019ve been able to increase gross margins in this quarter and for the year and expect that to continue despite some pressure from labor. We also talk a little bit about some commodities that you can kind of think of this as the trade impact, right, and last, if you think about China for example, we\u2019ve seen a bucket announced in July of tariff increases on a certain set of products and services, we were not impacted by that. The second bucket came in September. We were slightly impacted by that and we touched on that last quarter. And again, it\u2019s a pretty small amount, but that may continue. And certainly, then it\u2019s too early to tell on anything else that may change with China. We also \u2013 we didn\u2019t touch on it last time, but certainly NAFTA has been in the news quite a bit. And if we can continue to see the structure to replace NAFTA or continue NAFTA, but if we can see the structure to replace NAFTA in the USMCA, they\u2019re not much of a change there either. So the really good news is, while we do see a little bit of an impact, it hasn\u2019t been significant and it is certainly within our guided numbers. And really while we\u2019re on-trade, if we think about our supply chain, we\u2019ve got a really good global supply chain, and we\u2019ve talked about how we control much of what we purchase and when I say control, we either have owned manufacturing to a lesser extent, but we also control then fabric purchases and the shipment of those fabrics around the world to different sowing suppliers. We have the ability to be flexible with that and as trade \u2013 and as trade changes we have the ability to be flexible where many of our competitors do not, they are either tied to their own manufacturing or tied to third-party suppliers, we have the flexibility to be much more flexible than that. And so as we think about all of these different pressures, we like the way we are able to perform, we like the way we\u2019re able to leverage our infrastructure to find efficiencies, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing in this guidance and in our current results, we\u2019re able to increase our gross and operating margins despite some of these pressures. Now that could change if the macro environment or trade significantly changes and we\u2019ll certainly let you know about that. But as we stand today, we like the way we\u2019re able to adapt to some changes in the environment and still improve margins. George Tong : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And as a follow-up, can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing in the manufacturing verticals and in the oil and gas verticals given the recent move in oil prices, if the pipeline looking out over the next several quarters has changed at all, especially when you compare to earlier oil cycles with that have experienced similar levels of decline? Mike Hansen : Yes, I can\u2019t say that we\u2019ve seen much of a change at this point in time, it may be a little early. But we\u2019ve seen at least our business be pretty healthy in those and many other verticals. George Tong : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And next will be Andy Wittmann with Baird. Andy Wittmann : Great. Thanks. I just thought I would ask and maybe I missed it in the script, but could you talk about the SAP implementation, Mike, can you talk about maybe an update on where you are in terms of the number of locations or maybe the percentage of revenue that is now operating under that system and kind of what your outlook is here on the implementation in terms of timing if the endpoint of that has moved? Paul Adler : Andy, it\u2019s Paul. We did not comment on SAP in particular in the script, but we are still making nice progress. I think last quarter we mentioned, but I can\u2019t remember the number of locations, but we said that we had implemented about 42% of them and we\u2019re now at about 48%, so just about halfway through. So again like we\u2019ve talked about previously, things are going very well because of the nature of the implementation and how our existing operating new IT system is with a series of new AS400s boxes all over, it takes time to go from one to the other to the other, but everything is going well and we\u2019re still on track to complete the implementation in fiscal \u201820. Andy Wittmann : Great. Thanks. And maybe just a kind of a similar question given that a lot of this is concurrent. But just on the G&K integration, this was the year with a lot of the re-routing, which is obviously a very tricky thing or can be. Can you talk about where you are on that key thing, process in terms of how much has been re-routed and how that\u2019s going? And then maybe just more broadly on G&K overall, as you get more intertwined here, how are you feeling about that synergy number and what was recognized in the run rate maybe that synergies that you recognized in the quarter in the run rate that you are on today? Paul Adler : Sure. The route optimization continues, but as we\u2019ve talked about, we remain cautious in doing that because of that, really touches the customers it\u2019s movement of volume, it\u2019s affecting our SSR relationships and so we\u2019re being very cautious I don\u2019t have a percentage or $1 revenue number to share, Andy but, we are continuing to move forward with that and it\u2019s going well and I think the cautious approach is certainly helping us from an overall G&K standpoint as you mentioned, it continues to get more and more intertwined and part of the re-routing and route optimization is even more intertwining so I think, I\u2019ve talked a little bit about this, where if we have multiple locations, legacy Cintas and legacy G&K part of that route optimization, results in volume possibly moving from one plant to another so even a legacy G&K facility today that has participated in route optimization may have some legacy Cintas volume in there so it gets more and more intertwined however, we certainly like the performance that we\u2019ve seen out of the business, out of the integration activities and we still feel very good about the synergy numbers that we\u2019ve put out there we estimate that the current quarter is about $25 million in synergies that continues us very well onto our expectation for this fiscal \u201819 year and we still feel very good about hitting our targets for the overtime for the entire acquisition. Andy Wittmann : Great, I will leave it there. Have a good evening. Mike Hansen : Thanks. Operator : And the next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. Good evening guys. Actually, three. I want to slip one here in front in Uniform Rental Facility Services, I\u2019m just I\u2019m curious, you may have said it, I might have missed it the fiscal second half organic growth because the 6.6 was last year than you had expected I\u2019m just curious what is the expectation in the second half, are we talking high sixes or better or should be tempered because you said, kind of I just kind of curious if there are any more clarification, if I missed it? Paul Adler : We don\u2019t give guidance by segment, Scott but, the guidance range that we do have for the total company is about 6 to 7.2, I think and that would certainly suggest that there is room for continued acceleration in that range. Scott Schneeberger : Right, thanks. Appreciate it. That\u2019s helpful. So, visibility is my question. It\u2019s been asked a lot, obviously you guys and you mentioned some new business wins in the way that maybe trickles into the back half it sounds like you\u2019re very confident for the back half I\u2019m curious if you could talk maybe to some of your end markets, what the visibility would be out, you know, you have to speak to your current business conditions but what visibility is typically can you see out more than six-months and if so how far? Thanks. Paul Adler : Well, we try to see out as far as we can and that\u2019s we prep from an external point of view, we generally keep our guidance to the current fiscal year internally, we are certainly looking ahead and how we expect to perform in fiscal \u201820 and \u201821 and going forward I would say this, Scott absent a significant change in the macro, we like the way we are performing right now. Our sales force is performing very well, our integration continues and we as we get more and more of that behind us, we can get more and more efficient in the way we operate we like our products and services, we think it\u2019s a broad opportunity, we are not certainly not fully penetrated and so we continue to like the opportunity to sell to existing customers so, we feel like the business is running very well and I don\u2019t see a change in our ability to execute, unless something happens in the macro that throws a wrench in the works but what we are we all here at Cintas look forward to is getting more and more of the integration and the SAP implementation behind us so that we can even become a little bit more efficient in the way we operate. Scott Schneeberger : Okay, great answer. Thanks. And lastly, the CapEx guidance went down this quarter from last quarter, which went down from the prior quarter not huge, but it\u2019s trickling down I\u2019m just curious, is that maybe SAP related or is it something else, just kind of curious on that development? Mike Hansen : It\u2019s purely timing, Scott. We are continuing certainly to invest where we need to, some of it is timing from the standpoint of when we may need to bring a new plant online that can move a little bit here and there, depending on the situations in those local markets so, more than anything, it\u2019s just timing. Scott Schneeberger : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : And the next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, thank you for taking questions. Hi, Paul. Just wanted to ask a little bit on the free cash flow, it\u2019s down first half like 40 million AR. DSO is up 3 days sequentially. Is there a build in anticipation of future sales or something, is there a timing thing or just kind of build up as you\u2019re expecting continued sales execution if you give us some clarity on them? Paul Adler : Yes, I mean as you can see it\u2019s on working capital and there is really two, I guess two larger categories that are driving it and both are temporary so we don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything structural here and that we\u2019re concerned with one is, accounts receivable I mean, you can certainly see that on the balance sheet and on the cash flow statement and we don\u2019t have concerns about collectability our customers is really need and once what we provide and they do pay, but Mike has talked many times on prior calls about the inefficiencies that exist within the organization when you have two significant projects going on at same time the G&K integration, the SAP implementation, we have a lot of system conversions, customers are impacted, billing changes, invoices look different and because of that disruption it is causing some slowdown in cash coming in a little bit of a build of AR but again, we believe it\u2019s nothing, but temporary and we will collect. Mike Hansen : And let\u2019s not forget, we\u2019ve got some really nice growth and that\u2019s certainly increases the AR and there was about close to a $20 million impact from the rev rec adoption. Paul Adler : Yes. And to build on Mike\u2019s comment about the growth the other bucket is inventory and we talked last quarter about the fact that to support our growth we have a new distribution center facility services distribution center that came online, we\u2019re building inventory to ramp that up and get ready to put that operation in place so we\u2019re still burning off that inventory it\u2019s a little bit elevated at this point in time and then finally Shlomo we have a little bit of inventory build, because what we\u2019re finding is we\u2019ve had skews historically with just Cintas stand-alone that were not sufficient enough in the demand for us to inventory them in stock of them in our distribution centers so what would happen is our operations would just order these items from various vendors directly and they would ship back to those operations, but now with the increased volume from G&K, it does make sense to put more skewed in the distribution manage it centrally negotiate better cost by doing that, and so that is a little bit of an inventory build, but ultimately again that\u2019s a timing thing and that\u2019s a measure we\u2019re putting in place because we believe that will help us manage cost and lower them enough. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, great. Thanks for the color. And then just, it\u2019s been close to a year since Aramark and AmeriPride, I was just wondering if you are seeing any change in terms of their competitiveness there kind of a year into their integration. It was mentioned that they are planning to get into First Aid and Hygiene. I was just wondering from your guys in the ground, the ones that are actually talking to customers and noticing who else is driving around, are you seeing any changes from them that you\u2019re kind of monitoring? Mike Hansen : Well, we always like to monitor what our competitors are doing? And that\u2019s not just Aramark and AmeriPride, but all of our competitors I would say nothing significant that we would call out at this point. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : And moving on to John Healy with Northcoast Research. John Healy : Thank you, Mike. I wanted to ask a question, just trying to look at legacy Cintas customers and what Cintas customers now, but acquired through G&K, if you look at the revenue per staff per the revenue, per where however you kind of maybe boil that metric down what would you say is the difference between the Cintas legacy customer and what you acquired from G&K and if you look out over the next year or two how much of that gap do you think you still has potential to close? Mike Hansen : Well, we our revenue per stop certainly was greater than G&K was prior to the acquisition, and we think there certainly remains that opportunity we are, I would say we\u2019re closing the gap, but that\u2019s going to be a very it\u2019s a slow trip I guess, and it will take some time and one thing to keep in mind is we\u2019re still adding many new customers every year and those customers, we want to continue, we have the opportunity to continue to penetrate as well so I don\u2019t have a very specific metric that I can share, but certainly our revenue per staff was greater and there still is more opportunity both in our existing our legacy customers and the legacy G&K customers we like that penetration opportunity. John Healy : Okay, fair enough. And then I wanted to ask what is the movement in oil and doesn\u2019t sound like you guys have seen great change in the business was there much difference between how the U.S. and the Canadian operations performed in the quarter, just kind of curious if you\u2019re seeing much deviation there? Mike Hansen : No, I mean there\u2019s a lot going on in both countries in terms of implementations and integrations and I would say no, nothing to call out. John Healy : Okay, great. And then just kind of one big picture question for you, Mike, I feel like every business leaders comments are extremely scrutinized right now in terms of how they feel about the economy and pace of investments and things all along those lines when I hear your call and look at your numbers, there really isn\u2019t much to be negative about I mean quite strong across the board and you guys are buying a ton of stock back beneath the surface though, are you doing anything different versus 3 months ago, than you thought you would be in terms of hiring people? Making any sort of internal investments? Whether it\u2019s in the technology or logistics or operations? I was just curious, from a CFO\u2019s perspective, are you doing anything different versus what you thought maybe 3 months ago? Mike Hansen : The only thing we are doing is the revenue and the growth has been better than we thought 90 days ago certainly as you can tell from our guidance raise and we continue to invest for the future we like the way that the economy is operating right now it creates and provides a lot of opportunity for our products and services in all of our businesses and we\u2019re continuing to move forward the last thing we want to do is start pulling back on our growth levers, it\u2019s simply to try to predict a change in the economy, we are continuing to invest and grow like we set out to do at the beginning of this fiscal year. John Healy : Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : And the next question will come from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Tim Mulrooney : Hi, guys. Thanks for fitting me in at the end here. So, now that you basically got half your branches converted to the new SAP system do you have any early takeaways that you can share with us, with respect to the new system? Have you been positively surprised by anything? Finding new opportunities and how are these branches responding to change management which I know can be difficult, sometimes any extra color here would be great? Mike Hansen : Yes, I think the further we get into the integration the implementation of SAP, I would say, the easier it gets because we are getting better and better at it we have, as Paul said, we\u2019ve got a lot of locations in a lot of different markets and we learn from everyone and each one becomes a little bit more efficient so it is, certainly is still a big change management project and like I said, we\u2019re learning with each market that converts and that means we are getting ahead of the conversion we do a lot of communication we do a lot of training we do a lot of, not just training in terms of looking at documents and understanding but actually doing and working in the system so we\u2019ve gotten and we believe to be pretty efficient in pretty good at getting our locations prepared having said that certainly is still a disruption and it takes time to get through, it takes time to get our customers used to seeing that different kind of invoice etcetera. so, disruption will continue until we\u2019re finished with it, but we get better and better with each one from a standpoint of what have we seen out of the system we really do like the efficiency that brings to our SSRs our SSRs are our drivers, they have handheld computers, they are much better and much more efficient than they used to be and so we like how those are working our First Aid and Safety business has been on SAP for a few years and we like the knowledge and the information that gets to that business, we\u2019re starting to see a little bit of that in the rental business and as you can tell from the First Aid and Safety business we like how our growth is going there so we, I wouldn\u2019t say that, we have seen a lot of surprises from the standpoint of things that we didn\u2019t expect, but we like what we see. Tim Mulrooney : That\u2019s great. Thanks for the color. I will leave it there. Happy holidays gentlemen. Operator : And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll now turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. Mike Hansen : Well, thank you again for joining us tonight. We will issue our third quarter financial results in the mid to late March and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time and happy holidays to all. Operator : Well, thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Hansen : Good evening and thank you for joining us. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas\u2019 Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2019. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company\u2019s current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was $1.68 billion, an increase of 5.9% over last year's third quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 6%. In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 6.2%, and the organic growth rate for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment was 8.6%. The organic growth rates of both segments were negatively impacted by a greater number of customers being closed for business in this year's third quarter compared to last year\u2019s third quarter due to severe winter weather and the timing of the holidays, Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve fell on a Monday this year compared to on a Sunday in the prior year. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 of $755.2 million increased 7.8%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 44.9% for the third quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to 44.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment gross margin as a percentage of revenue improved 80 basis points from last year's third quarter to 44.9%, and the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment gross margin percentage improved 130 basis points to 48.2%. Reported operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 of $278.3 million increased 39.1%. Operating income margin was 16.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to 12.6% in fiscal 2018. Operating income was negatively impacted by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition by $800,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and $9.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Operating income in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was also reduced $39.7 million by a one-time cash payment to Cintas employees following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into legislation on December 22, 2017. Excluding the integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition and the one-time cash payment to employees, operating income increased 11.8% and operating income margin improved 90 basis points to 16.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to 15.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Reported net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was $200.9 million, and reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 were $1.83. Please note that there were a few items impacting the comparability of reported financial results. First, G&K acquisition integration expenses negatively impacted reported EPS in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018 by $0.01 and $0.06 respectively. Also, reported EPS in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 included a negative impact of $0.24 from the one-time cash payment to employees. Finally, reported EPS in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 included a positive impact of $1.59 from benefits under the Tax Act, primarily due to a one-time re-evaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Excluding these items, net income dollars increased 31.7% and net income margin was 12% compared to 9.6% last year. EPS increased 34.3%. As Scott Farmer, our Chairman and CEO stated in today's press release, we're pleased with our third quarter financial performance. Our employee partners are working diligently to exceed customer expectations while also making significant progress on integrating the G&K acquisition and converting more operations to our new enterprise resource planning system. And while our employee partners are focused on getting customers ready for the work day, we remain committed to efforts to increase shareholder value. In this year's third quarter, we paid an annual dividend totaling $220.8 million. The dividend of $2.05 per share was an increase of 26.5% over last year's dividend. Also in the quarter, we purchased $100 million of Cintas stock under our buyback program. As of February 28, we have now purchased $546.6 million of Cintas stock during fiscal 2019, and the amount remaining under our buyback program is $863.4 million. We updated our annual guidance for fiscal 2019, we expect revenue to be in the range of $6.87 billion to $6.885 billion. This implies a strong finish to our fiscal 2019 year, with fourth quarter revenue growth in the range of 6% to 7%, and operating income margin in the range of 17% to 17.5%. We expect EPS from continuing operations excluding certain items to be in the range of $7.42 to $7.48. Note the following regarding the EPS guidance, it assumes an effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 of 20.6%. This implies a fourth quarter effective tax rate of 24.5%. The reported effective tax rate in last year's fourth quarter was 21.5%. The higher tax rate expected in the fourth quarter of this year will have a negative impact of $0.07 to $0.08. Keep in mind that the tax rate can move up or down from period-to-period based on discrete events including the amount of stock compensation benefits. Our guidance assumes that diluted share count from -- for computing EPS of 111.5 million shares. It does not assume any future G&K integration expenses and it does not assume any future share buybacks. I'll now turn the call over to Paul. Paul Adler : Thank you, Mike. Please note that our fiscal third quarter contained the same number of work days as the prior year third quarter. Additionally, there will be no work day differences in our fiscal fourth quarter. Looking ahead to fiscal 2020, please note that there will be one less work day than in fiscal 2019. Each quarter of fiscal 2020 will contain 65 work days. One less day will negatively impact fiscal 2020 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points. To illustrate the magnitude of the headwind using fiscal 2019\u2019s third quarter revenue, one work day is about $26 million. One less work day also has a negative impact on operating margin. Fiscal 2020 operating income margin will be reduced by about 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2019. The negative impact on the margin occurs because certain expenses, like amortization of uniforms and entrance mats are expensed on a monthly basis as opposed to on a daily basis, and we will have one less day of revenue to cover the expenses. Please keep these headwinds in mind when modeling our fiscal 2020 results. We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services, and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our businesses included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services, and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,358 million, an increase of 5.7%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 6.2%. As Mike mentioned earlier, the organic growth rate was negatively impacted by customer closures caused by the severe weather and the holiday calendar. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.9% for the third quarter compared to 44.1% in last year's third quarter, an improvement of 80 basis points. Energy expense as a percentage of revenue was 2.4% compared to 2.5% in the prior year quarter. We are pleased with the gross margin expansion and our ability to overcome the weather and holiday challenges, as well as continued wage pressures, increased commodity costs such as for hangers which are sourced mostly from China, and the inefficiencies that are customary with an acquisition integration and an ERP system implementation. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of First Aid products, safety products and training. This segment\u2019s revenue for the third quarter was $149.2 million. The organic growth rate for the segment was 8.6%. This segment too was negatively impacted by severe weather and the timing of the holidays. The First Aid segment gross margin was 48.2% in the third quarter compared to 46.9% in last year's third quarter, an increase of 130 basis points. Note that First Aid segment gross margins are at record levels and had been marching higher since the acquisition of ZEE Medical three and half years ago. National account new business continues to help drive high-single digit organic growth. Penetration of existing customers with more products and services is also a major contributor to top line growth and it results in above average gross margins. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. Our Fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. Uniform Direct Sale business growth rates are generally low-single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Uniform Direct Sale however is a key business for us and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross sell and provide products and services from other business units. All Other revenue was $174.8 million, an increase a 4.5%. The organic growth rate was 2.3% and was driven by 11.3% organic growth in the Fire business. All Other gross margin was 42.3% for the third quarter of this fiscal year compared to 41.7% for last year's third quarter. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the third quarter compared to 30.9% in last year's third quarter. Note that the one-time cash payment to employees in last year's third quarter that Mike mentioned earlier was recorded in selling and administrative expenses. Excluding this payment, last year\u2019s selling administrative expense as a percent of revenue was 28.4% compared to 28.3% in this year's third quarter. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was 20.1%. In the third quarter of fiscal 2018 we realized a significant tax benefit from the Tax Act, primarily due to a one-time revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Our fiscal 2019 EPS guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 20.6% this implies a fourth quarter effective tax rate of 24.5%. The effective tax rate in last year's fourth quarter was 21.5%. As Mike stated previously the higher expected tax rate will have a negative impact on fourth quarter EPS of $0.07 to $0.08.  Our cash and equivalents balance as of February 28 was $80.9 million. Operating cash flow in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 15.7% from the amount of operating cash flow in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $70.2 million, our CapEx by operating segment was as follows, $55.8 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $8.1 million in First Aid and Safety and $6.3 million in All Other. We expect fiscal 2019 CapEx to be in the range of $270 million to $285 million. As of February 28, total debt was $2,754.5 million, $2,537 million is fixed interest rate debt and $217.5 million is variable rate commercial paper. At February 28, we are at our targeted leverage of 2 times debt to EBITDA.  That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : Hi, good afternoon. Mike Hansen : Hi, Toni. Toni Kaplan : Uniform Rental was a bit below what we'd expected this quarter. Could you just give us the organic growth ex the holiday shift and ex the weather closure? And is it possible that any sales were bumped into the fourth quarter? Mike Hansen : We expect that the impact was about 60 basis points to the growth of both rental and the total company. And I would say that we don't expect much to be bumped to the fourth quarter, and that's why you see the guidance coming down from a revenue perspective a little bit greater than the 60 basis points for the third quarter, 60 basis points is roughly $10 million in the quarter. When we think about that quarter, this is the first year since fiscal 2015 that the holidays weren\u2019t either on a Friday or a Monday. A Friday, the weekend or a Monday. And we just found there were many of our customers not only took off for holiday, but took off the Monday before the holiday, took off a day or so after the holidays as well. And when that happened, it just created a lot of disruption to our -- for example our new business effort where appointment setting for our sales reps became very, very difficult, and the momentum that they had going into the holidays was really stopped. And they had to regain that momentum with the decision maker meetings, et cetera after the holidays. The other thing was the weather, I mean, we -- if you think about the polar vortex for example, we had customer shutdowns from Minnesota all the way to the East Coast. And again, that creates real challenges for our sales people to get continued momentum of meeting with decision makers, et cetera, and it also has an impact on our drivers. Our drivers we call them service sales reps or SSRs. When our customers close, our SSRs have to squeeze more stops into a fewer number of days. And when that happens, our SSRs have less time to look for revenue opportunities. There's less -- because the customers are closed, there is less customer traffic to use our restroom products, for example. So, it certainly did have an impact on the quarter. Toni Kaplan : Okay, great. And then I wanted to understand all other a little bit better. It sounds like fire was really strong with 11% organic growth. So I'm guessing that means that direct sales were sort of weaker. Was it fire that drove the strong margins in that segment? I know that they jump around, but given last quarter was a little bit on the weaker side, was this sort of a catch up or was it the mix shift; just wanted to understand all other margin a little bit better? Thanks. Paul Adler : Yes, Toni, it's Paul. You are right, fire had a very strong quarter organically. And so, then the corollary is that Uniform Direct Sale did not perform as well. You know, that that direct sale business, it's non-recurring revenue, so it's a little harder to forecast, it's lumpier, it depends on rollouts, and it's tougher to forecast and the sales cycle is longer as well. So it's UDS, the Uniform Direct Sale business did come in lighter than we expected, and of course that suppressed margins as well. The Fire business overall, still continues to perform very well, high-single digit organic growth is the expectations and those margins will continue to improve rather as the organic growth continues to tick up. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital. Manav Patnaik : Good evening, guys. I just wanted to see if I could reconcile this right. So you said the impact in the quarter from both weather and I guess two less days was $10 million, but then for 2020 one less work day impacts you $26 million for the full year. So I mean is -- like is it just because it was in that holiday period maybe and it was less of an impact? Mike Hansen : Well, Manav when we have customers close, our goal is to reschedule the visit to them. So it's not like we completely lose one full day of revenue. We will still get the rental revenue. We just have to reschedule the stop so that we can pick up for example, dirty uniforms drop off clean, and we will still generate revenue because of that. But when we are doing that, it's the things like continuing to look for the penetration opportunities that suffer a bit. It's the new business that suffers a little bit.  So we don't lose all of the days\u2019 revenue. Because we have to still visit and serve the customer, it\u2019s just that the penetration opportunities and the new business productivity was challenged a bit. And despite all of that, 6.2% organic growth rate is still a pretty good performance by our rental business despite the challenges that we have. You're right though, as we think about 2020 that's a full day that we lose and don't get back in terms of the revenue within that fiscal year. And so that $26 million that Paul referenced, that's just an example of if you take our total revenue, divided by the number of workdays this past quarter, that's effectively the impact that it would have next year. Manav Patnaik : Okay, got it. And then maybe just the latest on the G&K integration, I guess just what's the next milestones we should be looking to hear from you guys? Paul Adler : Yes, Manav, the integration continues to progress very nicely. It doesn't mean though, that there's not heavy lifting going on in our operations still. That heavy lifting is typically now in the form of rerouting. And we expect that to continue into fiscal 2020. What we're really trying to do Manav is, in certain markets to minimize the disruption kind of sync up the rerouting for the G&K acquisition with the SAP conversion. So to minimize disruption to the operation, to the customers kind of handle all that change management at one-time.  So yes, still some inefficiencies exists in those markets where they're going through that. As I mentioned, that'll continue into 2020. But, the operations are doing a very nice job of taking care of the customer. And I think that the solid financial results are kind of a testament to that fact. Manav Patnaik : Got it. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan Securities. Andrew Steinerman : Hi, guys. You're going to hate this question, but I'm going to try it. When you look at the legacy G&K portfolio business, how fast do you think it's growing relative to 6% organic overall. And if you could talk about, sales force productivity in getting that G&K legacy business cross selling, et cetera? Mike Hansen : So, you're right, Andrew that's a really tough question. But I would say that the growth isn't quite near the legacy Cintas levels yet. We are seeing some nice performance in things like our hygiene penetration. And so we really do like the direction, but I would say we're likely not where legacy Cintas locations are just yet, but it's really hard to tell, because we have we have transferred so much volume from close locations to Cintas locations, we have as we optimize routes, we are moving G&K volume into Cintas and Cintas into G&K. So it's really -- it\u2019s very muddy when you try to parse that out. As it relates to the sales rep productivity, we have one sales team. Let's make sure we're clear on that. And the productivity is still very, very good. It's better than a year ago, it's not quite as high as it was in the second quarter because of some of the challenges that I mentioned a few minutes ago. But we're still very pleased with that performance. Andrew Steinerman : Any milestones ahead on crush selling that you could talk about into that G&K legacy business. Mike Hansen : I would say, because the business is so blended, Andrew. Our goal is just continuing to manage the business location by location, but we'll be reporting on it in total because it's so difficult. And we'll do our best to give some color like we have in the last couple quarters of that we like the revenue performance in former G&K customers. But it's going to be -- there's going to be a little bit more anecdotal as we go forward because of the blending of that. But if you think about the impact that I mentioned in terms of the weather on holidays, that's kind of turns of 6.2 into about a 6.8. And that performance we really like and certainly there is some help compared to where we were a year ago in terms of penetration at legacy G&K customers. Pretty hard to give a specific number, but we know there are some -- these certainly are signs of success. Andrew Steinerman : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Gary Bisbee : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. I guess the first one just following up on Andrew\u2019s question. This is the question, I think we all get all the time about the cross sell and you've never really provided any disclosure of any metrics consistently that would help people think about it. Have you -- and I know you have historically said, competitive reasons you didn't want to give too much.  But I mean, have you thought about, potentially, at some point introducing some metrics to help us track the success that you're having, whether it's customer accounts that we could look at revenue per customer or any other metric, it seems to me it would be helpful to your investor base if you were to provide something. Mike Hansen : Well, I certainly can appreciate that, Gary. We -- as you said, for competitive reasons, we don't like to give too much of that information. But I will tell you practically, if you think about what we've had going on over the last few years, we're talking about the largest integration that we've had in our rental business, the largest integration we've ever had in our First Aid business, and an SAP conversion. There's a lot going on and to try to get the kind of data that we would be comfortable enough providing externally out of the three different systems that we've been on that would be very, very challenging. And I understand your request and as we get fully on to SAP, we will certainly give that some hard thought. But gosh, we're in the midst of a lot of things going on that would make that kind of reporting pretty challenging. Gary Bisbee : Yes, fair point. I'll ask you again once SAP is fully up and running. That's a good point. Mike Hansen : I will expect that question in a couple years. Gary Bisbee : Fair enough. A couple of other ones. So a quarter ago, you said fairly strongly that you are seeing no signs of economic weakness from the customer base in the U.S. and Canada, do you have the same level of conviction or is that same statement ring through today or give -- has the trade impact and some of the other things that have been out there? Have you noticed any impact in the last three months that would change that kind of statement? Thanks. Mike Hansen : Gary, we still like the environment that we're operating in. Aside from the weather challenges, we like the environment and our customers seem to be very healthy. They're investing. There are lots of job openings. And GDP is still at a level today and expected for the rest of the calendar year where we'd like to operate. So we haven't seen a lot of change other than the weather disruption, which was certainly real. Gary Bisbee : Thank you. And then just one last one, the amount of SG&A leverage if we back out the one-time payment a year ago, still positive but narrowed relative to the last few quarters. I would guess that the revenue impact this quarter had -- was part of the reason. But is there anything from your perspective changing in the ability to deliver operating leverage in the near-term or was that anything else to explain that? Thank you. Mike Hansen : Yes, the weather that we\u2019ve talked about, the revenue challenge that we\u2019ve talked about probably took 20 basis points of additional leverage in SG&A. So we probably would have been 30 basis points better than last year in total. No, there are ups and downs we are self-insured we get some things that are -- that go up and down. We invest for example in our First Aid and Safety business where we've been growing so nicely. But there's nothing that I would look at as a challenge as we move forward to continue to see that number tweak down. Gary Bisbee : Great, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Hauke with R.W. Baird. Justin Hauke : Yes, great. Thanks guys. Two questions here, I guess one, I think the positive that we can take away from this is the margins were pretty good considering the revenue shortfall. And, you called out some of the factors that are still out there the inflationary costs and whatnot. But I guess I was curious on the labor costs specifically, if you could just comment on maybe where that's trending were net pricing is trending? How those have changed from maybe three or six months ago? Mike Hansen : Yes, labor pressures, I would say, are about the same as we've seen in the first two quarters of this fiscal year. I wouldn't call it any worse. But they still remain. And as we've talked about in the past, we work diligently to deal with those. First of all, we want to retain our partners. And so, we do as much as we can to keep our partners engaged and satisfied in terms of working with us. We want to pay them the right wages for sure so that we can, again help keep them engaged. And that's -- partner retention, which remains high for us is such an important part of managing our labor. But in addition to that, we look for opportunities for process improvement, we look for automation and other types of efficiencies and we've been doing a pretty good job of that so far, not to mention the fact that the synergies that we're getting off of the G&K integration certainly help and are timely. But they remain. And our goal is to continue to perform well despite them. As it relates to the pricing environment, we haven't seen a lot of change from quarter-to-quarter in that environment either. And I don't look for that to change a whole lot as we move forward, at least in the next quarter or so. Justin Hauke : Okay, great. Second one here, just maybe more numerical, but the G&K integration expense was pretty light and your guidance to $0.09 looks like it's probably going to stay fairly light in the fourth quarter as well from the -- I think you were saying $18 million to $22 million was the total for the year. So is it because you're just ahead of schedule, and there's not more expense or those moving into 2020? Or just how should we think about the level of integration expense that remains? Paul Adler : Yes, Justin. I mentioned earlier about the integration activities, and it's largely rerouting and then our supply chain is still hard at work. Realizing synergies as well. But, rerouting does not really drive significant costs. The purpose of the rerouting is to get those routes more dense that lowers energy costs provides us with more time to spend with the customers. So, it's a smallest bucket of the synergies. And the fact is that the larger expenses related to the integration came when the plant closings occurred, closing the plants, decommissioning them, severing and we just don't have any of that left. So we would expect another maybe $2 million to $3 million of integration expenses in the fourth quarter. So we'll probably end the year at about $16 million in total. And then looking ahead to fiscal 2020, it's going to be very small, very nominal amount of integration expenses. But again, we're not finished with the integration activities. We're still rerouting. A lot of challenges out there for our operations, but it just doesn't drive the significant expenses that the other activities did. Mike Hansen : And just to be clear, there are still expenses and inefficiencies for example duplicate routing, training overtime and attempts. But the expenses Paul talking about are those that are identifiable that can be really called out into that integration line. The heavy lifting in the route optimization remains and the inefficiencies and the costs associated with it also remain, they're just really hard to call out. So for example, when we're training SSRs to -- on new routes, we've got a little bit of duplicate labor going on when we're training and pulling them out of their off of their routes. There's a little bit of inefficiency in duplicate labor. When we've got overtime, it's hard to tell how much of that is the day-to-day and how much of that is the true integration work. So there are expenses and inefficiencies that remain. They're just much harder to call out specifically. Justin Hauke : That makes sense. That's helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Dolev with Nomura Securities International. Dan Dolev : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Appreciate it. So sorry to harp on this, but if I think about the organic growth even ex. the impact of weather, et cetera, the 6.8 it's about a 20 basis points acceleration. And if I look back your comp was getting about 80 basis points easier if I'm not wrong. Is there anything to read into that and what is driving that as far as I remember back in like 2017 you put out like 8% comp quarters like what are the odds of us getting back to those rates and what's driving the meter acceleration ex. weather? Thanks. Mike Hansen : Yes, the -- I mean, Dan, the 8% that you're referring to they were strong and they were without any G&K in them that was prior to G&K becoming inorganic. And so we're -- we -- I had a question from Andrew a little bit ago about how much is the legacy G&K business growing and while it's very, very difficult to tell, it's also pretty clear that that they are not growing quite at the legacy Cintas levels yet. We certainly believe that they can get there over time, but that doesn't happen overnight. As we look to the fourth quarter, the range of revenue that we've given is a 6% to 7%. We think it's a very, very healthy range. And at the midpoint there's some acceleration there. And so we're very, very pleased with the progress that we've made. We got a little bit of a hiccup with the weather and the holiday challenges, customer closure challenges, but gosh, we're right where we wanted to be. Dan Dolev : Got it. And just 6% to 7% overall not just uniformly, right? Mike Hansen : 6% to 7% overall, yes. Dan Dolev : Got it. And then my second question is -- sorry. Mike Hansen : Go ahead. Dan Dolev : No, I was going to ask about the synergies in the quarter and like if you can give us I think last time you had $25 million. Paul Adler : Yes, Dan, the synergies and we began the fiscal year and we said got it to $90 million to $95 million in total for the year. And we're on track to achieving that, we'll actually probably wind up a bit above the top end of that range. And then next fiscal year, think about incremental synergies of maybe $30 million to $35 million. So, the bottom line is that we continue to track very nicely what we committed to in the beginning, which was the $130 million to $140 million of synergies within those four years. Dan Dolev : Perfect. Good stuff, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Hi, thanks, good afternoon. You\u2019ve previously indicated that ancillary products such as First Aid and Fire Safety have less than 20% penetration among Uniform Rental customers, can you help frame where that number can go as cross selling increases not only at G&K, but also the broader Cintas customer base? Mike Hansen : Yes, we haven't really talked about that a lot publicly and the reason is it's -- that's a difficult thing to specifically target, we certainly think about that in the different verticals. And some verticals are better than others for that penetration. But George, we're not really ready to give goals and targets. I would say this, the standalone businesses are still growing very, very nicely. And we think there's a lot of runway in just simply growing each business on their own. But there's no question there's more penetration opportunity available, but I'm really hesitant to put that -- put us in a box and say there's a goal there just yet. George Tong : Got it. And then drilling down into the SAP implementation, can you give us an update on how many branches have undergone the conversion and when you would expect to start seeing margin benefits? Paul Adler : George, we are about 57% now through the conversion, and that's about 202 operations that are now on SAP. If you remember, like this time last quarter, we were at 48% converted. So, a lot of good activity obviously in this past quarter. As far as the margin benefits, we haven't quantified any of the benefits, we've talked about and given examples in terms of the power of the system, and what it can do for our route people with a satellite based type of handheld device, the efficiencies that that brings, opportunities in our stock rooms with managing inventory and sharing it and having visibility. But then also a lot of benefits in terms of opportunities to cross sell and look into the system of First Aid and Safety to better understand national accounts and just a lot of opportunities around big data and being able to do profitability analysis and price reviews and all that type of stuff.  So we will have more commentary on that as we continue to get through the rollout, but a lot of those benefits for the system, especially as they relate to the top line and some profitability improvements. You need the entire network to be in and we're just over half of the way. So nothing that we can quantify for you at this point in time in terms of the benefits. George Tong : Got it, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Mario Cortellacci : Hey guys, this is actually Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. Could you give us any color on your net add stops during the quarter. And actually just curious how relevant that metric is to-date compared to it was -- compared to history because the portfolio has changed with the time. So once you see if that's actually relevant anymore. Paul Adler : Yeah, the add stops metric, is a real -- we consider it a very old legacy Uniform Rental type of metric that, we use decades ago when we were predominantly providing uniforms and entrance mats, it might be meaningful still to some of our comp competitors. But it's not as meaningful to us because we have such a huge breadth of products and services that we have more to offer to customers than just uniforms and mats. And we are not also dependent upon the customer base, just adding jobs and going along with GDP and kind of being propelled or held back by employment you look back at our results and we have grown consistently in multiples of excess of GDP and jobs. So the add stops metric, which is more about kind of same store sales, how is that particular customer growing? Are they adding or subtracting? It's not as meaningful to us. We're trying to drive the growth through penetration and through attacking new verticals like scrub rental with new products and services.  So long winded answer to say, it's not meaningful to us, there wasn't anything significant to note in add stops. I would say that, to Mike's point earlier, we rely on penetration of our existing customers. And it was clear in looking at our operational data, that the weather and the holidays did impact that our ability to penetrate and then that's part of that 60 basis points headwind that we had this quarter. Mario Cortellacci : Got it. And just one more, I'll turn it over. I guess just given the portfolio changes, since the last major slowdown. Could just give us a sense of how Cintas might perform in a decelerating macro environment? I'm sure a piece of your business could be a little considered late cycle, I assume that First Aid would be a little more resilient. And I just didn't know I guess obviously a piece of the business is still levered to the employment cycle. But I guess what would that look like if there was slowdown? Mike Hansen : Mario, I typically answer those questions by -- with starting out with it depends on how deep and how broad that next slowdown would be. We have a very diverse customer base. We've got customers of all types in all types of verticals, customers of all sizes. And so we've got a very diverse customer base, and that helps us when things like a few years ago, the oil and gas customers really were suffering with low oil prices helped us a few years ago when there were some measurements of an industrial recession. And we still grew through those kind of things. But it really depends on how deep and how broad. If we can hit our revenue guidance, and our EPS guidance, it will be 48 out of the last 50 years, where we have grown sales and grown profits. And that would be growing through six out of the last seven recessions. So how do we stand in the next one, depends on how deep and how broad. We have done some things since the great recession that we think are beneficial to our performance through the next slow down and that would be a broader product line, so that we have more things to offer to our prospects and our existing customers. We have a sales team that is a little bit more sophisticated than it was prior to the great recession where we specifically attack specific certain verticals. And we sell to existing customers a little bit more proactively. So we look to drive more revenue that way. And we have probably even more diverse customers today than we had prior to the last recession where we\u2019ve really targeted things like health care and education, which are a little bit more recession resistant. So we've made some changes since the great recession. But we've also performed very well over the course of the last 50 years in all kinds of economic cycles. But I would always go back to dependent on how deep and how broad. Mario Cortellacci : Got it, thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. Good evening, guys. You just gave synergy guidance for next year as well on an earlier question. I found it interesting because it sounds like you're trending really well on the 90 to 95. So, the inferences you're at the high end of that. And then the incremental guide 30 to 35 the high end of that gets you to the 130 the low end of the total. So, just kind of curious, is there might you finish a year earlier than originally anticipated? Or might be there -- might there be incremental upside that we see in this? And, if so, where the areas sourcing, routing, you touched on a little bit books, where the areas that maybe you're progressing ahead of that are worth addressing at this juncture? Thanks. Mike Hansen : Yes, great question. Scott. I would say this, we have some sourcing synergies that we are still working on. And as we've talked about, they come a little longer because we had to burn through G&K inventory. And then we have to source from either our new supply chains or put the volume, the greater volume into our existing supply chains. We have to then get the inventory to our locations and put it in service where it becomes -- where it begins to amortize. And so there will be synergies in our fiscal 2021 that still are from that global supply chain effort. And it's hard to pull those forward. So getting back to your question, I think there may be a little bit of upside, and I think that upside, you may have heard me say a few times in the past, I think the biggest bucket for the upside is that sourcing and supply chain. Where we kind of built that opportunity off of the G&K inventory and supply chain. And the opportunity -- the upside opportunity might be does that impact the Cintas sourcing and supply chain. In other words, does the combined volume then help even the Cintas pricing to drive lower as well. I'm not ready to give any kind of numbers, but I think that's where the opportunity lies. And as you suggested, we expect to be at the low end of that range next fiscal year and driving towards the high end and possibly through the high end in fiscal 2021. Scott Schneeberger : Great, thanks. It\u2019s good progress. More a housekeeping question for my follow up, tax rate has been jumping around and just for our benefit in modeling fiscal 2020, how would you think about it for the annual and quarterly as we model out ahead, just some rules of thumb because I think without a little guidance that could be all over the place? Mike Hansen : Yes, you're right about that, Scott. I think with the with the change in the stock compensation a few years ago, this tax rate has really been bouncing around because we don't -- we can't control the exercises of options and we can't control the stock price. We talked a little bit about a 24.5% in the fourth quarter. So that is our expectation there. And as we look to finish this year, if we do that 24.5% in the fourth quarter, that would put us at a 20.6% for the full fiscal 2019 year. That's lower than we would expect our typical run rate to be. With our stock performance, we had a tremendous amount of exercises this year. And it's hard to say that those are going to repeat next year. So I would expect that our tax rate would be right in the range of 22% next year, with a fairly low tax rate in the first quarter because we generally get more stock comp benefits followed by a higher rate in Qs two through four. And I would suggest maybe using fiscal 2019's quarterly rates that we've talked about as maybe a bit of a guide to ratably get you there. But I would say for the full year, I think a 22% type of a number would be right, where I would say that's currently our expectation. So obviously then that if we are at a 22% next year and a 20.6% this year, that puts a little bit of pressure on us with that increase. Scott Schneeberger : Great, thanks. I appreciate that incremental color. Good job, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Tim Mulrooney : Yes, good afternoon, guys. Pretty much hit on everything. But maybe I'll talk -- ask about the balance sheet, a 2 times leverage it seems like a good point to check in on your capital allocation priorities. How should we think about capital deployment after CapEx between the dividend, share repurchase and M&A? Mike Hansen : Yes, so our cash flow remains healthy. In fact it was very good in the third quarter and we expect it to continue to perform well into the future. That creates opportunities obviously. We want to continue to invest in the business, we will do that by growing the business via things like adding routes, adding sales people and doing advertising and R&D. Those things will run through the P&L just like they have, but those are very, very important pieces for us. Our CapEx, I would expect to continue kind of in that 4% to 4.5%. And that's very important to us. We want to make sure we are creating the capacity for growth. Those are our two highest priorities. Aside from that, we certainly love the tuck-in acquisitions, and we will continue to look for opportunities there as best we can in our Rental, First Aid and Fire businesses. We will also look at there are larger opportunities, particularly in our existing businesses, we would love to take a look at those. So we'll be as aggressive as we can be on looking for great value out of small and larger types of acquisitions, particularly within our businesses. That's going to leave us though with some cash. And so, we certainly love to increase the dividend we've done so every year since 1983. I would expect that the Board will continue to look very strongly at that, and then there may be buy backup opportunity. And as we've shown so far this fiscal year, where we've acquired almost $550 million through our first three quarters. We like that program, we like the momentum of the business. And I would expect that we'll continue to look at that opportunistically. In addition to all of that, our EBITDA continues to grow and we like that 2 times leverage neighborhood. We are there right now and our expectation is we\u2019ll continue to be in that range. Tim Mulrooney : Okay, Thanks, Mike. Thank you for the thoughtful answer. Just on the M&A front, are there still areas in the U.S. where you feel there may be more room to grow through M&A in your Rental business? And also what's your position with respect to expanding internationally? Thanks for your time. Mike Hansen : Sure, from a U.S. perspective, it's more about the opportunities and it is the geography. We are in almost all geographies in U.S. and Canada, but there are still 600 or so independent operators out there. And so the opportunity really is more about the location of those independent operators and having a dialogue with them and understanding if we can team up and create long-term value together. So we will, will continue to look for those opportunities, no matter the geography in the U.S. and Canada. From an international perspective, I would say this, we love the U.S. and Canadian opportunities. We think there are a lot there, we will continue to invest heavily in those businesses. I think there may be a time in our future where we get in into other international geographies. It's not our highest priority. But I think that's something that we\u2019ll keep our eyes on. I would say that in our business, startups are pretty difficult. And so it would likely be through some sort of M&A, but it would have to be with the right partner, in the right geography, and one in which we felt like we could operate successfully. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Seth Weber : Hey, guys, good afternoon, and thanks for keeping the call going here. Most of the questions have been asked and answered, but maybe just going back to the CapEx commentary for a second. I think, earlier this year, you had brought the CapEx number down a little bit because you had sort of message that you're able to extract some of the -- some benefits from the G&K business.  So how should we be thinking about CapEx going forward? Is it brick and mortar? Are you -- do you feel like you need more capacity here? Or is there anything that you could point to that you'll be spending money on specifically? Thank you. Mike Hansen : Well, we -- you're absolutely right, Seth, we did get some benefit from the G&K acquisition in terms of capacity, and it allowed us to delay certainly some CapEx related to new capacity both in plants and in our routes. But we're continuing to grow and we're continuing to grow well. And capacity is really a local thing. And so there are certainly still geographies where there may not have been a G&K presence, where we're growing well, where we need capacity. And so we'll continue to look for or we will have a CapEx related to laundry capacity and routing capacity. I would say from a growth perspective most of our CapEx growth will be in that form, laundry facility capacity and routes and i.e. trucks. Same goes for our First Aid and Fire businesses as well. We are growing very, very nicely. And the growth will come primarily in the way of additional trucks. We\u2019ll certainly have some maintenance CapEx too, but from a growth perspective, yes, certainly bricks and mortar and trust. Seth Weber : Super, that's all I had guys. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And we have another other questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Mike Hansen for any closing remarks. Mike Hansen : Well, thank you again for joining us tonight. We will issue our fourth quarter financial results in July, and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Hansen : Good evening and thank you for joining us. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas\u2019 Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2019. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company\u2019s current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 was a record $1.79 billion, an increase of 7.4% over last year's fourth quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 7.6%. In the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201919, the organic growth rate for the uniform rental and facility services operating segment was 6.8% and the organic growth rate for the first aid and safety services operating segment was 10.7%. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201819 of $823.6 million increased 9.5%. Gross margin, as a percent of revenue, was 45.9% for the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201819 compared to 45.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201818. Uniform rental and facility services operating segment gross margin, as a percent of revenue, improved 100 basis points from last year\u2019s fourth quarter to 46%. And the first aid and safety services operating segment gross margin percentage improved 70 basis points to 47.7%. Reported operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201819 of $314.4 million increased 18.4%. Operating margin was 17.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201819 compared to 15.9% in fiscal \u201818. Operating income was negatively impacted by integration expenses relating to the G&K acquisition by $900,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201819 and $15 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201818. Excluding the integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition, operating income increased 12.4% and operating margin improved 80 basis points to 17.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201819 compared to 16.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201818. Reported net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201819 was $226.2 million and reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201819 were $2.06. Reported EPS was negatively impacted by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition by $0.01 in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201819. Excluding the G&K acquisition integration expenses, net income dollars increased 13.5% and net income margin was 12.6% compared to 12% last year. EPS increased 16.9%. We are pleased with these fourth quarter results, which conclude a very successful year. A year ago, in our prepared remarks, we shared our expectations for fiscal \u201919. We provided revenue and earnings per share guidance, we committed to an estimated amount of synergies from the G&K acquisition and the continued conversion of operations to a new ERP system. We shared our excitement for -- with returning to our debt to EBITDA target ahead of schedule, and we committed to returning to our historical priorities for deployment of cash. We are happy to report that we not only achieved, but exceeded these expectations.  For the ninth consecutive year, our organic growth rate was in the mid-to-high single digits. This means, we've been able to grow consistently in multiples of GDP and employment growth. Due to our strong growth, innovative products and services, and hard work and dedication of our employee partners, we moved up 41 places to number 459 in the Fortune 500 ranking. For the ninth consecutive year, we achieved double digit earnings per share growth from continuing operations when adjusted for one time and special items. We paid an annual dividend of $220.8 million that increased 26.5% over the prior year. We've now increased the annual dividend paid to our shareholders for the 35th consecutive year, and the company deployed excess cash by purchasing 4.8 million shares of company\u2019s stock for a total amount of $953.4 million. Fiscal \u201819\u2019s achievements were especially noteworthy given that they were accomplished in a period of extreme change management, in which we were integrating our largest acquisition to date and implementing a new enterprise resource planning system, namely SAP. The integration of a very large acquisition required the extra effort of everyone in the organization. Our partners executed our playbook and made the right adjustments when necessary. Better revenue retention and more cost synergies have resulted in a higher return on investments and plan. In many respects, the implementation of an ERP system is like an integration of a very large acquisition. It impacts hundreds of operations and requires the involvement of experts from all departments of the company. The conversion of each operation to SAP is an eight-month process of planning, changing business processes and employee mindsets, training and certification and customer communication. In implementing SAP, we are moving from a decade\u2019s old platform to new technology that provides powerful information and data designed to help us improve our business. Through fiscal \u201819, about 65% of the operations are now in SAP. We will complete the roll out to the remaining locations in fiscal \u201820. The Cintas\u2019 story is one of growth. We have grown both revenue and profit 48 of the past 50 years. The only exceptions were the Great Recession years. Our successful financial formula is organic revenue growth in the mid-to-high single digits, double digit earnings per share growth, significant cash generation, and prudent deployment of excess cash. Our priorities for uses of cash are investing in the business for growth, acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases. Our opportunity for continued growth is great. We have a product or service to help nearly every business get ready for the work day. This is evident in a diverse customer base spread over numerous verticals in both services providing and goods producing sectors of the economy. All businesses care about image, safety, cleanliness, or compliance, and businesses continue to outsource to concentrate on their core competencies. We are well positioned to continue to benefit from these tailwinds. We enjoy unrivaled scale, innovate our product and service offering, invest in technology, and build our brand. Cintas possesses numerous competitive advantages, but our greatest one is our culture. This year, Cintas celebrates our heritage 90 years in the making. The Cintas culture is a foundation upon which the company is built, and it is the reason for the company's success. The culture reflects our integrity, professionalism, and dedication to our customers. Other hallmarks including positive discontent and competitive urgency drive us to innovate and stay out in front of the competition. The Cintas culture is why even after nearly a century of success, we believe our best years are ahead. Before turning the call over to Paul for more details, I'll provide our fiscal \u201820 expectations. We expect revenue to be in the range of $7.24 billion to $7.31 billion. We expect EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $8.30 to $8.45. Note the following regarding the guidance. The growth rate at the revenue guidance range is 5% to 6.1%. However, our fiscal \u201820 contains one less work day than our fiscal \u201819. Adjusting for this one day difference, on a constant work day basis, the revenue growth rate range at guidance is 5.4% to 6.5%. One less work day also has a negative impact on EPS, reducing it about $0.06, which is a 90 basis point drag on the EPS growth rate. The guidance assumes an effective tax rate for fiscal \u201820 of 21% compared to a rate of 19.9% for fiscal \u201819. The higher effective tax rate in fiscal \u201820 negatively impacts our EPS growth about 180 basis points and total EPS by about $0.14.  Keep in mind that the tax rate can move up or down from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. The guidance assumes a share count for computing EPS of 109 million shares. This consists of diluted weighted average shares outstanding, plus participating securities in the form of restricted stock. It does not assume any future share buybacks, any potential deterioration in the US economy or any further specifically identified G&K integration expenses. And lastly, the guidance does not or does include the impact from the adoption of the accounting standards update 2016-02 on leases. With the adoption, significant changes to the balance sheet will occur. We expect the assets and liabilities to increase in the range of $160 million to $185 million. However, we do not expect any material effect on the P&L or the cash flow. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Paul. Paul Adler : Thank you, Mike. Please note that our fiscal fourth quarter contained the same number of work days as the prior year fourth quarter. Looking ahead to fiscal \u201920, please note that there will be one less work day than in fiscal \u201819. One less day will negatively impact fiscal \u201920 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. To illustrate the magnitude of the headwind, using fiscal \u201819\u2019s annual revenue, one less work day equates to about $27 million. One less work day also has a negative impact on operating margin and EPS. Fiscal \u201820 operating income margin will be reduced by about 12.5 basis points in comparison to fiscal \u201819 due to one less day of revenue. The negative impact on the margin occurs because certain expenses like amortization of uniforms and entrance mats are expensed on a monthly basis as opposed to on a daily basis and we will have one less day of revenue to cover the expenses. As Mike stated, one less work day is a headwind of about 90 basis points on EPS growth, and about a $0.06 drag on total EPS in comparison to fiscal \u201819. Each quarter of fiscal \u201820 will contain 65 work days. In comparison to fiscal \u201919, the fiscal \u201820 Q1 will have one less day; Q2 will have the same number of days; Q3 will have one additional day and Q4 will have one less day. Please keep the quarterly day differences in mind when modeling our fiscal \u201820 results. We have two reportable operating segments, uniform rental and facility services and first aid and safety services. The remainder of our business is included in all other. All other consists of fire protection services and our uniform direct sale business. First aid and safety services and all other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement. Uniform rental and facility services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route.  Uniform rental and facility services revenue was $1.43 billion, an increase of 6.4%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 6.8%. Our uniform rental and facility services segment gross margin was 46.0% for the fourth quarter compared to 45.0% in last year's fourth quarter, an improvement of 100 basis points. Energy expense, as a percentage of revenue, was 2.4% compared to 2.55% in the prior year quarter. We are pleased with the gross margin expansion and our ability to overcome wage pressures and tariff impacts. Our first aid and safety services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment\u2019s revenue for the fourth quarter was $163.5 million. The organic growth rate for the segment was 10.7%. The first aid segment gross margin was 47.7% in the fourth quarter, compared to 47.0% in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 70 basis points. First aid segment gross margins continue to increase with strong top line growth. As our volume grows, we can negotiate better pricing from vendors. Growth also enables us to improve route density, reducing gasoline and diesel costs, and enabling our service teams to spend more time serving and upsell. Our fire protection services and uniform direct sale businesses are reported in the all other category. Our fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. The uniform direct sale business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Uniform direct sale however, is a key business for us and its customers are all often significant opportunities to cross sell and provide products and services from our other business units. All other revenue was $201.8 million, an increase of 12.7%. The organic growth rate was 11.6% and was driven by 14.3% organic growth in the fire business. All other gross margin was 43.7% for the fourth quarter of this fiscal year compared to 43.6% for last year's fourth quarter. Selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenue, were 28.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201819 and \u201818. Lower labor expense, as a percent of revenue, was offset by increases in other expenses including stock compensation, insurance, workers\u2019 compensation and medical. We are self- insured and therefore subject to some volatility in workers\u2019 comp and medical expense from quarter to quarter. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201819 was 21.7%. As Mike stated earlier, the tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Our cash and equivalents balance as of May 31 was $96.6 million. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201819 increased 31% from the amount of operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201818.  Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $68.9 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows : $54.7 million in uniform rental and facility services; $9.6 million in first aid and safety; and $4.6 million in all other. We expect fiscal \u201820 CapEx to be in the range of $280 million to $310 million. As of May 31, total debt was $2,849,000,000; $2,537,000,000 was fixed interest rate debt and $312 million was variable rate debt in the form of a term loan and commercial paper. At May 31, we were at our targeted leverage of two times debt to EBITDA. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is actually Greg calling in. I was just hoping to get an update on the G&K synergies in terms of where we were exiting 2019, what we expect in 2020, and how you guys are feeling about potential sources of upside going forward. Mike Hansen : We finished fiscal \u201819 a little bit over $100 million for the year, a little bit better than we expected at the beginning of the year. And I would expect that in fiscal \u201920, we\u2019ll get to the neighborhood of $135 million, which is right in the middle of the range that we guided to three years ago when we announced the G&K deal. So we feel great about achieving the synergies we initially set out to do. If we can get to that 135 in fiscal \u201920, that's a year ahead of schedule, we had talked about a four year plan, and so we feel really good about achieving that. The lifting, the heavy lifting that's left continues to be the route optimization that will continue in fiscal \u201820. That's, as we've talked about over the last few years, that's not a source of significant synergies. We will get some energy benefits as we eliminate mileage on our routes, but we certainly are growing and need to continue to add capacity on route. So all in all, Greg, we feel great about where we are in that G&K integration. Unidentified Analyst : And then I also wanted to ask about natural adjacencies out of your, outside of what is the core business currently. It seems like we're getting towards the end of some of the heavy lifting on the integration and the SAP implementation. And leverage is pretty reasonable at this point. Just wondering if that changes how you guys think about potentially going after some of these markets and what kind of markets that could potentially be? Mike Hansen : Well, we, I would say this, we -- I mentioned a little bit in my prepared remarks that we look for opportunities in image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance and those are some pretty good umbrellas to be covering for our customers, and there are a lot of opportunities there. As we've seen over the years, we have had product adjacencies in all of our businesses and we're continuing to look for those under those four umbrellas that I mentioned. And certainly, we're looking for other things that may also be included under those umbrellas that could be possibly a different route structure or what have you. But, we're being disciplined and we want to make sure that there is long term value that there's a big market opportunity for any new type of product adjacency or business. We certainly, as you mentioned, we are at our two times leverage kind of a goal, and we've got a strong balance sheet and so we're going to be looking for opportunities to deploy that cash and certainly acquisitions and other investments in our product lines are right at the top of our list. So we'll be looking for opportunities. Operator : Our next question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : Wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about the economic and employment outlook and basically what you're hearing from your customers right now in terms of their propensity to spend going forward, just some background on the industry would be great. Mike Hansen : Well, we feel pretty good about the macro; still, the environment still feels pretty conducive to sell new business to continue to penetrate and you see with our fourth quarter revenue results, as well as the guidance that we've given that we feel pretty good about the momentum that we have in the business and that we\u2019ll continue into our fiscal \u201820. We look at GDP for calendar \u201819, it\u2019s still above expectations or still above 2%. If you think about the last nine years, that's the neighborhood in which we've performed and we've had a pretty good nine year period where we have grown in excess of that GDP and employment. So we still like the macro environment. In the last quarter, we've seen just under 500,000 jobs being created in the last six months, a million in the last year, 2 million. And so the job growth has continued to be pretty good as well. So Toni, we like the environment and as you can see by our fourth quarter and our guidance, we like the momentum in the business. Toni Kaplan : That's great. And then in terms of margins, how should we be thinking about expansion across the segments in the upcoming year and then additionally, how should we be thinking about incremental SAP costs over next year. Mike Hansen : So, from a margin perspective, our guidance would imply something in the way of low-to-mid 17s as a company, and we're certainly striving within each of our businesses to grow margins and that's our expectation. That margin expectation for fiscal \u201820 would include some pretty good incrementals as a total business. And so, we continue to look for opportunities and expect improvements in that. From an SAP cost perspective, we\u2019ll continue to roll that system out this fiscal year. And we've talked about some of those rollout costs rolling off after fiscal \u201820. That's been somewhere in the, let's call it, $10 million to $12 million because we've talked about SAP costs from a few years ago, increasing about 25, about half of which has been costs that are related to the rollout whether it's training, consultants, et cetera. So we do expect that some of that will roll off in fiscal \u201821. Operator : And next, we'll go to Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Hey, really nice job, the organic growth in the fire business, the 14.3%, was there anything in there in particular that kind of drove that and then just really, really, really nice margin expansion. Can you give us a sense of how much of a headwind kind of the tariffs and we just work because obviously we're able to really offset that nicely. Paul Adler : Yeah. Kevin, it\u2019s Paul. I'll talk about fire and turn it to Mike on the tariffs. But in terms of fire, yeah, the organic growth was strong at 14%. But we continue to expect out of that business, organic growth of 10% or a little bit better. So, very good execution in Q4. But that's kind of par for the course with the fire business of late. So nothing specific to really call out. But we just continue to do a great job of winning business. We have a very professional, aggressive sales force, and kind of leveraging our service capabilities that we have in uniform rental, and our experiences there through the fire business and very professional service oriented businesses on the service side, and so we expect that strong organic growth to continue. Mike Hansen : Kevin from a tariff standpoint, there certainly has been a lot of noise in the tariff environment, and -- but I would say, certainly a little bit of impact, not a lot, the noise around Mexico kind of came and went. China, while we have seen a lot of noise and seen some tariffs, we have not been too affected by the first couple of buckets of those tariffs. But we're not immune to additional tariffs that might happen. We have to stay ahead of those things and so we're seeing a little bit of it. But there's probably more noise than impact. From a labor perspective, we have certainly seen some impact market by market especially. I wouldn't say that it's been significant. We do, in our production or our plant\u2019s environment, we do see a little bit more difficulty in hiring people. But generally speaking, the pressures that we've seen have been not significant and we've been able to deal with them quite well so far. We're certainly going to need to continue to keep our eyes on all of the tariff information that's going on, though as we move forward. Operator : Our next question will come from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Gary Bisbee : I guess if I could go back to margins and the margins implied in the guidance. I think if we back out the margin benefit from the tale of the G&K synergies and also the drag from one less work day, it doesn't sound like the guidance implies a whole lot of margin expansion outside of those -- from those two factors, so I know you tend to have some conservatism in how you guide, but is there anything else you'd call out that would lead to less operating leverage in fiscal \u201820? Mike Hansen : No, and quite honestly, Gary, I'm not sure that I would agree. I think if you think about that margin improvement, that's, let's call it low to mid 17s compared to 16.7 for fiscal \u201819 would imply, at the midpoint, roughly incrementals right around 30%. That's at the high end of where we've talked about being. If you strip out those incremental synergies, you're still above 20% at the midpoint. So we feel we're right where we want to be with those operating margins and we do expect continued improvement even without the synergies, but inclusive of the synergies, we like the margin expansion quite a bit. Keep in mind, Gary, keep in mind that when we compare, if you're backing from EPS, we've got a $0.14 headwind in the higher tax rate than in fiscal \u201818 and then as you mentioned, we've got the $0.06 headwind from the one less work day. So if you're backing in from EPS, you got to keep in mind, there's a $0.20 headwind. Gary Bisbee : Yeah, I guess I was just doing, you said 35 million incremental savings, that's 50 basis points and then that's offset by 10 or 15 from the one less work day. It\u2019s sort of like half that margin, but I guess your point is fair that the other half is still pretty good expansion, so that's fine. I guess I just want to ask one other thing\u2026 Mike Hansen : Yeah. And I would say from a synergy standpoint, Gary, I would -- we think about it as 105 to 135. So about a $30 million improvement. Gary Bisbee : Okay. All right, fair enough. And then on SAP, a two parter, you've, I guess, you said, you're 65% of the way through the network rollout at this point, you've talked about two benefits, the one you're most excited about is just the information allowing you to cross sell and run the business better. How is that playing out, once you've got one of your facilities that is up and running, is that pretty quick or is there a meaningful learning curve? And I guess what I'm really trying to get at is, are you beginning to benefit yet from the rollout to date, or should we think of it more as a future benefit, later this year, maybe even more so into next year. Mike Hansen : Sure. There is a learning curve. No question about it. This is a system that is heavily data dependent and we have to change our business processes locally to be able to use that system most efficiently. So, there is a drag in terms of, we talked about an eight month planning process prior to implementation, there's also a period of time afterwards where we're getting efficient at using the system. So it certainly is a process and a lot of change going on.  From a local perspective, I think we are seeing some incremental benefits like new portable route computers for our SSRs and so there are some incremental benefits that are probably more on the minor side. I think from the ability to manage the information, we would typically do that at greater than a one location at a time type of a look. And so the more we get on, the more we can begin to look at different regional groupings and take advantage of the power of that information. So I think most of that is going to come as we move into \u201821 and \u201822. Gary Bisbee : And then if I could just sneak in one quick cleanup number, you said last quarter you expected like in the cadence of \u201819, that the Q1 tax rate would be a lot lower. Is last year's number a good ballpark or should we think it's higher than that, but still much lower than the rest of the year? Mike Hansen : Yes, you're right, Gary. It will be quite a bit lower. I would probably think of it in terms of a kind of a 12% to 13% type of a range and a lot of that will depend on the level of stock compensation benefits based on the price of our stock, the performance of the stock, but you're right, it'll be much lower than the rest of the year. Operator : Our next question will come from Blake Johnson with Goldman Sachs. Blake Johnson : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Regarding your revenue guidance, how much of the growth do you expect to be driven by further penetration of the non-programmer market versus headcount growth at existing customers? And can you discuss traction and penetrating underrepresented verticals such as healthcare and industrials this quarter? Mike Hansen : Sure. So, for fiscal 20, our new business efforts are generally the driver of our revenue growth in all of our businesses and we like the opportunities there particularly in that no programmer space, we can get to that no programmer space with our unique garments, with our unique garment solutions like our scrub systems and we think there's a big opportunity there. So, we expect that to continue to drive the growth like it has for years past, but the penetration remains good. It's when we can provide a good product and articulate the value to our customers. They certainly have shown that they're willing to spend, so that certainly will be important for us, but it's led by the new business efforts. From a fourth quarter perspective, those under penetrated verticals continue to perform very well : healthcare, education, the government sectors, they continue to perform very well. We are focused on those areas, particularly with our sales efforts. And we're encouraged by what we have seen in \u201819 and expect good things out of those verticals also in fiscal \u201820 and beyond. Blake Johnson : And then regarding G&K, one of the strategic benefits was to drive higher penetration of ancillary products to legacy G&K customers. Can you discuss any progress made here? Maybe the current percentage of cross selling between various lines of business or any other metrics that would be great. Mike Hansen : We certainly have made progress in fiscal \u201819 in terms of some penetration, it's hard. I'm not going to provide any specific penetration because so much of that volume is intermixed with legacy Cintas volume. However, we certainly have seen that our penetration has been strong. Our hygiene growth has been strong for the year. And so we are encouraged and believe that we've made some good headway there and expect to continue that in fiscal \u201820. But I would say, overall, we're pleased. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman : Just a quick comment about client retention levels and any changes year-over-year and my second question is the pricing for new accounts, has that seen any upward movement in recent years? Paul Adler : Andrew, it\u2019s Paul. In terms of retention, I would say that really no significant change in our business. It's been roughly about 95% and that's still where it was last fiscal year, and that's where we still expect it to be. Of course, we're always working on improving that and there are opportunities, but I would say nothing significant to note. In terms of pricing, I've been doing a lot of businesses for new accounts. Mike Hansen : Andrew, it's a pretty competitive environment still out there. And I'll give you an example. When we're out there selling work wear, for example, our customers have lots of options and, and so there is a retail option, where we're seeing billions of dollars being spent at retail, large retailers, we're seeing direct sale options where those competitors can design and manage programs and we're seeing the rental option as well. So our customers have alternatives and options. And so we have to continue to innovate and create good garments and other products, we've got to be able to articulate the value of what we do versus a retail environment versus a direct sale program. And we've got to follow through on that great service. So the point Andrew is, our customers still have lots of options. The competition is certainly out there, and is available to them and we've got to make sure that we are providing the right value. And so all of that competition keeps, it's a bit of a governor on what we can do with pricing. And so while we are looking for the best price and we sell profitable new business, there certainly is competition that keeps that pricing in a bit of a tighter range. Operator : Next, our question will come from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Seth Weber : I wanted to ask about the big share buyback in the fourth quarter. In your prepared remarks, you kind of listed share buyback as I think, third or fourth in your pecking order. So, I mean, is this just a function of you couldn't find acquisitions that you liked or valuations just stretched above what you're willing to pay or can you just sort of characterize why the buyback was so strong in the fourth quarter relative to kind of your pecking order? Thanks. Mike Hansen : Sure, our pecking order is just as we said, and we are certainly looking for opportunities, but I'll tell you, Seth, our cash flow was really good. In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was just under $400 million. In the third quarter, it was $325 million. So $725 million in the second half of the year. So cash flow has been really good. And, look, we like to put that to work. We would love to be, we have continued to invest in the business. We would love to find acquisitions. We are aggressively working on those, but we can do the buyback that we just did in the fourth quarter and still do execute on a large acquisition if it became available. So it's a little bit opportunistic. We like the momentum in the business, the average of those, the average buyback was something in the way of just under $220 million for the fourth quarter. And based on where our stock sits today, it feels like a pretty good move for us. So I think it's opportunistic, we\u2019ll continue to look at it this way. But we certainly love investing in the business and we love to make acquisitions as well. Seth Weber : And then just maybe just to comment on the SG&A in the fourth quarter was kind of flattish year to year, you did mention some extraordinary costs, so I think, that offset the lower labor. So, how are you thinking about SG&A as a percentage of revenue for next year? Should you see some leverage there? Should it go down as a percentage of revenue? Mike Hansen : We certainly do. If you think about the fourth quarter, one of the call outs that Paul made was our stock compensation expense. Our stock continues to perform very, very well and we love that. But it does result in greater stock comp expense, it was higher by about 30 basis points than last year. When we have a good stock performance, we generally will also get a lot of stock option exercises, which we had in the fourth quarter, which was why our tax rate was a little lower than guided. And when we have those exercises, because they are non-qualified stock options, there is an employer portion of payroll tax. And so when you combine those things, it's a little bit of a headwind. We don't mind it because of the stock performance, but it was there. For the year, our SG&A was down 30 basis points, and we certainly do expect to get leverage in fiscal \u201820 and beyond. That doesn't mean it's going to happen every quarter, but certainly over the course of the year, we expect it. Operator : And next, we'll go to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : I have three, but a couple might be quick and easy. First one, the way you guys have sized the synergies, it's been more in a time period of achievement than it has been, any change to the absolute level. And you said obviously, the route optimization is the last big piece that isn't going to be super impactful. So I guess the question I'm getting at is, is there potential upside to the 130, 140, once we get out a year from now, or is this probably going to be it for the way you guys discuss it? Mike Hansen : Well, two things. First of all, the upside, I've mentioned a few times in the past, we think is coming, will come from our sourcing environment, as we kind of combine the G&K spend, legacy G&K spend and our spend. We have seen some of that heavy lifting that is rolling into our P&L and will continue to do so in fiscal \u201821. And we look for continued opportunities and benefits there. So if it gets above the 135, that I mentioned earlier, and we generally expect that it will, it'll likely be in that service, I'm sorry, in that supply chain area.  I'll say this though, Scott. It gets harder as -- the farther we get from the acquisition date, it gets harder and harder to specifically say whether it's a synergy or just more efficiency in the business. And so our expectation is after fiscal \u201820, we won't be talking about that quite as much and we'll be moving forward with looking for all different kinds of efficiencies in the business. Scott Schneeberger : The next question is just on CapEx, looks like an increase of about 1% to about 12% at the high end of the range year over year. I was just curious what would be the swing factors of the 1% versus a 12% over the coming year on a year over year basis? Mike Hansen : I'm a little confused by what you mean by 1% to 12%. Scott Schneeberger : Just comparing the spend \u2013 for the guide of fiscal \u201820 versus fiscal \u201819, assuming my numbers are right. Mike Hansen : So the guide of 280 to 310, you're saying it's a, you're saying a 12% increase over our CapEx for fiscal \u201819? Scott Schneeberger : Yeah, that's correct. At the high end, it's 1% at the low end\u2026 Mike Hansen : Yeah, I'm sorry. Sorry, it took me a bit to understand that. Look, we're growing, we're growing nicely. And we've, as you know, we consolidated quite a few G&K locations into Cintas locations, but there still are capacity needs, particularly in those markets that didn't have a G&K operation in them. And so we do have capacity needs as we continue to grow, and I would expect that that would, that that fact would continue, if we continue to grow the way we're growing. And so we're going to probably have a little bit of an uptick this fiscal \u201920, just simply because we are continuing to grow and add more plants than probably we have in the last few years because of the consolidation efforts. Scott Schneeberger : And that third question that I wanted to get in with was on the fourth quarter call and in years past, you've shared a little bit of information with regard to uniform segment revenue mix. I'm not anticipating much of a change, but is that something you're open to sharing this year? Paul Adler : Yeah, Scott. I have that and you're right, not much of a change. Uniform rental, and as you mentioned, this is measured as a percentage of the uniform rental and facility services segment and it\u2019s Q4 data. So uniform rental, 50% of the mix. Dust control came in at 18%; hygiene is 14%, shop towels at 5%, linen 9% and then catalog was about 4%. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And next we'll go to Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird. Justin Hauke : I guess the one question that I had here just on the balance sheet, and, kudos for getting the leverage down to where you're looking to hold it at two times. But I'm curious on the upside, in the cycle where we are today, how much leverage would you be willing to tolerate to the extent that there were opportunities, whether an ancillary business or your current business, maybe there were more material acquisitions that would be out there. How much leverage would you be willing to put on the balance sheet here? Mike Hansen : Well, I'll start with, we currently have a covenant that limits us to 3.5 now. We've got a great banking group and if we had an acquisition that forced us to go above 3.5, then we would look at it in a couple of different ways. First, does it create the long term value that would warrant that kind of leveraging? And secondly, given then the combined cash flow, would we be able to reduce that fairly quickly like we did with the G&NK, after the G&K deal closed? We would look at it from those two standpoints. So I think it just depends on the value and the long term value creation. But we'd certainly, if we felt like it was a great opportunity, we certainly would evaluate that. Operator : Our next question will come from Dan Dolev with Nomura. Dan Dolev : So on uniform rental organic growth, I can't believe I'm complaining here, because 6.8 is truly an amazing number. But, comparison was about 120 basis points easier. I mean, what can get us upside to that number in fiscal \u201820? Is it productivity, is it up selling like, when can get to that heydays of the 8% organic growth? What needs to happen for that thing? Mike Hansen : Well, we would certainly need a very good macro and we like the macro today. But we would need a good macro. We need to be firing on all cylinders in terms of our sales productivity and with some good and innovative products and services. And, we've got to be really on our game to sell into our current existing customers. Dan, the last four years, our organic growth has been right in this range where we came in this fourth quarter, and we talked about a few times in the past, we like this pace. It allows us to manage the growth in sales reps, the growth in route capacity, the growth in production capacity, and so we do like the pace and we think that we can get some pretty good margin improvement when we're at this kind of pace, we can manage the business very well. And we like it, the last four years, we've been -- our organic growth in total has been 6.8, 6.7, 7.1, 6.5 and obviously, the 6.5 included the first quarter, where we were bottoming out in terms of the post G&K. That's right where we want to be, that 6.8 and our guidance for next year is pretty darn close to that. So that's the pace we like, Dan. Dan Dolev : And then just a quick follow up on the productivity just to be clear. I think last quarter, you said that sales productivity was good, but if I can quote, not as good as it was in the second quarter, is there an update to that one in terms of how it trended in the fourth quarter? Mike Hansen : Yes, Dan, you are correct. We were making great progress on sales rep productivity, kind of coming out of the G&K acquisition in terms of filling the sales roles and getting everybody trained and up to speed and then also getting the systems converted, which was necessary for those G&K reps to sell the Cintas product line. You'll recall, we\u2019re making nice improvement through Q2 and then last quarter in Q3 with some weather impacts, we noted that the productivity dipped, but in Q4, it did bounce back very nicely, even stronger than it was in Q2. Operator : Our next question will come from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Tim Mulrooney : A couple of quick ones here. First of all, if I go back to the fourth quarter, and I look at uniform rental segment gross margin expansion of 100 basis points year-over-year and that's a very solid result. Can you just walk us through the primary factors driving that expansion outside of the lower energy costs? Mike Hansen : Yeah, we certainly got some good leverage from the revenue growth. We had some nice synergy capture. Energy, as you said, helped a little bit and we're selling profitable business. And so a lot of things went well in the quarter from a pricing perspective, probably a little bit better in the fourth quarter incrementally than in previous quarters, the pricing while still competitive, as I talked about, with Andrew\u2019s question, probably just a little bit, incrementally more positive. And that certainly helps the margin as well. So all in all, great synergy, great leveraging, selling good profitable business and a little bit of energy help, all put together for a pretty good quarter. If I could add that this -- the rental gross margin for the year was up 170 basis points from our fiscal \u201916, which was the year before the G&K deal. So if you think about adding a legacy G&K business with a gross margin of about 37.5% to now today that full rental gross \u2013 full your rental gross margin of 45.5, we've made some great progress in the last few years and our partners have worked so hard in integrating this acquisition. We bought a very good business and our new partners have done a great job, our existing partners have as well. And it really shows in this fiscal \u201819 year with some really good margins, especially in that gross margin area. Tim Mulrooney : Yeah. I think everybody in the investment community would agree with that statement. It\u2019s been very impressive. If I could move on, how much do you have remaining on your buyback, Mike, and does your guidance assume -- what does your guidance assume with respect to share repurchase? Mike Hansen : We have 263 million on the billion that was authorized last fall. And the guidance assumes no additional share buybacks. Tim Mulrooney : No additional share buybacks, okay. And lastly from me, any quantifiable impact from weather in the quarter. I mean, we had more rainfall across the US this quarter, but I'm not sure if that has the same level of impact that the cold weather had last quarter. Mike Hansen : Not nearly the same widespread impact. So nothing worth calling out. Operator : And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today and I'd like to turn the call back over to Mike Hansen for any additional or closing remarks. Mike Hansen : Well, thank you again for joining us tonight. We will issue our first quarter financial results in September and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Operator : That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Sir, please go ahead. Mike Hansen : Thank you, and good evening. Thanks for joining us. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2020. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal '20 was a record $1.81 billion, an increase of 6.7% over last year's first quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays, was 8.3%. In the first quarter of fiscal '20, the organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 7.5%, and the organic growth rate for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment was 13.8%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '20 of $849.1 million, increased 9.6%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 46.9% for the first quarter of fiscal '20, compared to 45.6% in the first quarter of fiscal '19. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment gross margin as a percent of revenue improved 150 basis points from last year's first quarter to 47.2%. And the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment gross margin percentage improved 110 basis points to 49%. Reported operating income for the first quarter of fiscal '20 of $306.1 million increased 15.4%. Operating margin was 16.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '20, compared to 15.6% in fiscal '19. Operating income in the first quarter of fiscal '19 was negatively impacted by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition by $4.9 million, or 30 basis points. Reported net income for the first quarter of fiscal '20 was $250.8 million, and reported earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal '20 were $2.32. Excluding the G&K acquisition integration expenses in fiscal '19, EPS increased 20.2%. As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer was quoted in today's press release, we are pleased with our start to our fiscal year. We thank our employee-partners for continuing to execute well on our important initiatives. Before turning the call over to Paul for more details, I'll provide an update of our fiscal '20 expectations. We expect revenue to be in the range of $7.28 billion to $7.32 billion. We expect EPS to be in the range of $8.47 to $8.57. Note the following regarding the guidance. The growth rate at the revenue guidance range is 5.6% to 6.2%. However, our fiscal '20 contains one less workday than our fiscal '19. Adjusting for this one day difference, on a constant workday basis, the revenue growth rate at guidance is 6% to 6.6%. One less workday also has a negative impact on EPS reducing it about $0.06, which is a 90 basis point drag on the EPS growth rate for the year. The guidance assumes an effective tax rate for fiscal '20 of 20.3% compared to a rate of 19.7% for fiscal '19. The higher effective tax rate in fiscal '20 negatively impacts EPS growth about 80 basis points and total EPS by about $0.06. Keep in mind that the tax rate can move up or down from period to period, based on discrete events including the amount of stock compensation expense. The guidance assumes a share count for computing EPS of 109 million shares. This consists of diluted weighted average shares outstanding, plus participating securities in the form of restricted stock. And it does not assume any future share buybacks, any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy or any additional G&K integration expenses. I'll now turn the call over to Paul. Paul Adler : Thank you, Mike. Please note that our fiscal '20 contains one less workday than in fiscal '19. One less day will negatively impact fiscal '20 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. To illustrate the magnitude of the headwind using fiscal '19's annual revenue, one less workday equates to about $27 million. One less workday also has a negative impact on operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '20 operating income margin will be reduced by about 12.5 basis points, in comparison to fiscal '19 due to one less day of revenue. The negative impact on the margin occurs because certain expenses like amortization of uniforms and entrance mats are expensed on a monthly basis as opposed to on a daily basis. And we will have one less day of revenue to cover the expenses. As Mike stated, one less workday is a headwind of about 90 basis points on EPS growth, and about a $0.06 drag on total EPS in comparison to fiscal '19. Each quarter of fiscal '20 will contain 65 workdays. In comparison to fiscal '19, our upcoming Q2 of fiscal '20 will have the same number of days. Q3 will have one additional day, and Q4 will have one less day. Please keep the quarterly day differences in mind when modeling our fiscal '20 results. We have two reportable operating segments Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consist of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.45 billion, an increase of 5.8%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes and differences in the number of workdays, the organic growth rate was 7.5%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 47.2% for the first quarter compared to 45.7% than last year's first quarter, an improvement of 150 basis points. Energy expense as a percentage of revenue was 2.20% compared to 2.45% in the prior year quarter. The gross margin expansion was driven in large part by the strong revenue increase covering certain fixed production and service department costs. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $172.1 million. The organic growth rate for this segment was 13.8%. The First Aid segment gross margin was 49.0% in the first quarter compared to 47.9% in last year's first quarter, an increase of 110 basis points. First Aid segment gross margins continue to increase with stop - with a strong top line growth. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. Our Fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct Sale business growth rates are generally low single digits, and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multi-million dollar account. Uniform Direct Sale, however is a key business for us, and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units. All Other revenue was $184.5 million, an increase of 8.8%. The organic growth rate was 9.7%. The Fire business organic growth rate came in at 12.5%. Uniform Direct Sale business had a good quarter too, posting an organic growth rate of 5.8%. All Other gross margin was 42.8% for the first quarter of this fiscal year, compared to 42.9% for last year's first quarter. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.0% in the first quarter of fiscal '20, and 29.7% in the first quarter of '19. Lower labor expense as a percent of revenue was offset by increases in other expenses, particularly an 80 basis point increase in medical expense. We are self-insured and therefore subject to some volatility in medical expense from quarter-to-quarter. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '20 was 10.1%. Stock based compensation positively impacted the tax rate. As Mike stated earlier, the tax rate can move from period to period, based on discrete events including the amount of stock compensation expense. Please note three new line items on our balance sheet, resulting in an increase in assets and liabilities by about $165 million. These relate to our adoption in the quarter of the Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, entitled Leases. The adoption does not have a material impact on net income or cash flow. Our cash and equivalents balance as of August 31 was $102.1 million. Operating cash flow in the first quarter of fiscal '20 increased about 70% from the amount of operating cash flow in the first quarter of fiscal '19, and benefited from strong earnings growth, and improvements in working capital. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $64.7 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows; $53.0 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $8.1 million in the First Aid and Safety, and $3.6 million in All Other. We expect fiscal '20 CapEx to be in the range of $280 million to $310 million. As of August 31, total debt was $2,876.9 billion. $2,538.1 billion was fixed interest rate debt, and $338.8 million was variable rate debt in the form of a term loan and commercial paper. At August 31, our leverage of 1.9x debt-to-EBITDA was slightly lower than our target of 2x. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : The Uniform gross rental margins were really strong this quarter expanding by about 144 basis points. Was there anything one-time in there, or I guess how much could be attributable to synergies? And how should we think about the pacing of synergies this year? Mike Hansen : Nothing really one-time. We did as Paul mentioned, we got a little bit of a benefit 25 basis points from energy. So we got a little bit of benefit there. The synergies - our expectation is that they will be generally consistent from quarter-to-quarter. So call it roughly $35 million. That would - if that happens, that will get us right through that $140 million for the year, which we - as we talked about a few months ago. We're going to be right around that range, $135 million to $140 million. And so we feel pretty good about our ability to capture those synergies. I would say the rest of it is nice execution, getting through a little bit more of the integration activities and seeing some efficiencies at play. The environment for pricing was similar to the fourth quarter where we sat a bit incrementally better than we had seen. So got a little bit of revenue help from that standpoint as well but not really any one-time items. Toni Kaplan : And now that you've reached your target leverage, can you talk a little bit more about what you would look for in an acquisition? Would you prefer sort of domestic or international for uniform versus ancillary services? And lastly would you expect any regulatory issues just given your size at this point? Mike Hansen : So from an M&A perspective, we love M&A and our - in the businesses that we're currently in, certainly. Anything from a tuck-in in our Fire, First Aid and Uniform Rental businesses to something larger. We certainly - if there were any M&A opportunities in our space, we certainly want to be involved and would have a great interest in - in pursuing that at the right value. And we certainly like from a geographic standpoint, it's easier to capture synergies for example, with acquisitions in the U.S. and Canada because we have a presence here, and it allows us to get density in markets to combine capacity if those opportunities present themselves. So we would prefer acquisitions where we can capture better synergies. Your last question of, do we expect any regulatory issues? That certainly depends on what type of acquisition and the size of that acquisition, but, let's assume a large acquisition in the workwear space for example. If one came available, we love to take a look at it. And when - I would say something that you may not be considering, others may not be considering is, we have so many people that look at our business from a served market perspective. And we view the market is so much bigger than that. So for example, we compete in the workwear space, there is a lot of competition in the workwear space. Some of our competitors in workwear are from a retail standpoint. So in other words, they simply sell workwear. Walmart and Amazon each sell over $5 billion annually of workwear. So they are large competitors in the space. And we have other competitors that provide workwear and design and shipping capabilities. They manage programs to a certain extent. So there are those kind of competitors. And we happened to provide workwear through manage programs. We source, we deliver, we maintain, we launder for our customers. And so there is a lot of competition in the space. We've kind of told you for many years, over 60% of our new business comes from no programmers. And who are those no programmers? They are retail space, they are direct sellers. They are people who do it themselves. But we've shown year after year, that we, that is part of our market space. Now we can also lose business to those kinds of - let's call it non-traditional competitors. My point in telling you all of this is, the opportunity is really large and much larger than our served market. And so, look, if there is an opportunity that's large in our space, we certainly would have interest, we want to understand it, it would have to be at the right value, and we'd have to - we'd have to articulate that competitive set, which we think is quite large. Operator : Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital. Manav Patnaik : My first question is obviously, the first quarter growth was pretty impressive and well above your full year guidance ranges I guess. Could you just help us maybe walk through, if there is any quarterly cadences that we should be looking at? Mike Hansen : Well. Sure. So maybe we'll start with the first quarter. We did have a really nice first quarter. Our non-rental businesses performed really well. Paul, maybe - Paul gave a little bit of comment on those, but maybe you can give a little bit more color on those business. Paul Adler : Yes, sure, Manav. So let's start like with First Aid. We mentioned the organic growth at 13.8%. That's a business that has executed very well. We typically expect organic growth to be in high single digits, maybe 10% is what we've talked about for that business. So they came in a little bit stronger. Of course, there is a lot of blocking and tackling a lot of variables that go into the performance in the quarter. But of note, we did have a new item that we rolled out in the quarter. A new item in the cabinet and it's kind of like a - kind of like a rollout of a direct sale program, for example in Uniform Direct Sale business where you're putting that into the cabinets, you get a lot of revenue, and then you're counting on some smaller trail of that revenue going on in the lapping quarter. So a little bit of a boost because of that new product rollouts, and so outlook for First Aid is going to be continuing to have a great year, but probably the latter quarters more in the high single digits where we historically have been. Fire. That business, impressive organic growth rate of 12.5%. Again a lot of pieces to that with execution of the sales force and great quality service. But they did have a little bit of an easier comp, Manav. I think their growth rates a year ago was about 8%, so little bit higher than 8%. So I think some of the 12.5% was a little bit of that easier comp. And in that business, the Fire business, there is really two types of revenue streams. There is a more reoccurring revenue stream that we call test and inspection, testing and inspecting fire extinguishers and sprinkler systems, et cetera. It tends to repeat more often. But we also have another revenue stream when things break, when alarms don't work, you have to perform repair and maintenance. And we had some national account repair and maintenance type revenue in the first quarter that was a little bit larger than we expected, and we don't expect that to repeat. So I think the 12.5% was a little bit higher than we typically expect. And then finally kind of rounding out the other business units. You'll note - well you can't - I mean we might have mentioned in the prepared remarks that the Direct Sale business had a good growth rate of 5.8%. A year ago, the growth rate was rather weak, in fact it actually had some shrinkage of about 1.8%. So that's a business that I think benefited from that easier comp in the first quarter. And as we've talked about previously in our prepared remarks that Direct Sale business is typically more of a 3% grower, long-term. Mike Hansen : Yes. So, Manav when you look at the performance, I would say the non-rental businesses had great quarter, maybe outperformed our expectations a little bit, and probably don't expect that going forward. From a rental perspective, again had a really nice quarter. We had some really good execution by our rental partners. I mentioned a little bit of - the pricing was similar to the fourth quarter, which was incrementally good. So, got a little bit of benefit there. Probably got a little bit of a year-over-year benefit. Keep in mind, last year in the first quarter, that was our lowest organic growth. So we were - our volumes were still kind of finding the bottom. So probably got a little bit of benefit in that regard too. So as we look out over the next three quarters, we don't look at - we don't - there shouldn't be a lot of inconsistency in terms of the growth, but you know things can happen from quarter-to-quarter, but don't see a lot of movement from one quarter to the next for the rest of the year. Manav Patnaik : And then if I could just ask in terms of the G&K revenue synergies. I know, I don't think you are looking to quantify anything. But any anecdotal color on, if you're starting to see that - the needle mover in terms of your results? Mike Hansen : Well, we started talking about this a little bit. We saw signs of benefit in the first quarter of last year, and saw some nice execution throughout last fiscal year. And so we did see some benefits throughout last year and saw a little bit of that in the first quarter. As we move forward from a lapping perspective, I don't know that I would expect anything that is significant, but we're - it's something that we're constantly, every week that we visit those customers, we're talking with them, we're educating them on what we do, and sometimes these take time. And we're going to continue to cultivate those relationships as we go. I wouldn't expect any significant amounts in any one particular quarter. But it's certainly is a nice benefit for us. Operator : Our next question will come from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : At this point, given the gross margins, is it fair to say and I know we\u2019re not just interviewing G&K. But is G&K up to the corporate average at this point, or would you expect that to continue to kind of narrow relative to where Cintas is relative to G&K? Mike Hansen : Well, as you referred to, it's really hard to say. So for example, a lot of that G&K volume resides in legacy Cintas locations. So when you think about that volume, it certainly has helped us in those kinds of locations, create more capacity utilization, create little bit more density and so there certainly is a benefit. From stand alone locations, many of them have inherited some legacy Cintas volumes, but they're not quite to where we would see the rest of the Cintas legacy locations, but they're making nice progress. So we hope to continue to see improvements as we move forward. Kevin McVeigh : And then just with the benefit from energy, was that - was there any organic growth headwind, i.e., would there have been maybe a benefit last year from surcharges and you don't have those surcharges, or it would have all been on the expense side? Mike Hansen : We started to see a little bit of softening towards the end of the first quarter in the energy space. Keep in mind, it's not a big part of our revenue base, but we started to see a little bit of softness, I would say no headwind in the quarter from a revenue perspective. We're keeping our eyes on it though, as we move into the second quarter and beyond. Kevin McVeigh : I guess, I'm sorry, I was thinking more in terms of fuel. You don't get the fuel surcharges. I know it sounded like you saw some relief from energy costs. I just wondered if that was a headwind on the revenue line. Mike Hansen : Yes, I'm sorry, we don't have a fuel surcharge. So the energy, the gas prices, we don't flex our pricing or surcharges based on the price of the pump. I'm sorry, what I was referring to was our customers, in the oil, gas, mining areas that generally, when you see the prices of the gas at the pump come down in the past, when we've seen those prices really come down, it kind of hurts that business here in the U.S. And so the - we saw some benefit in that price of the pump as we said 25 basis points in rental. But we also saw a little bit of softening in the business side of it from a customer perspective. And so that's what we're keeping our eyes on. But we don't have a fuel surcharge. So no impact relative to that. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Gary Bisbee : I guess you sort of alluded to this earlier in the commentary about some of the places where you saw strength this quarter, but clearly in the Rentals business you had a much easier comp on both organic revenue and margins in the year ago. And so I guess I just wanted to ask, is it right to think that that is a portion of the rentals business improvement and may be more significant than any sort of sequential improvement in momentum relative to what you were seeing this past spring? Is that fair? Mike Hansen : So in other words, yes. Gary, I think your comment on, did we get some year-over-year benefit? Yeah, I think there was probably some of that, as you - as you alluded and I mentioned a minute ago. Our organic growth was still finding the bottom in terms of our volumes in rental and so there certainly is a little bit of year-over-year benefit there. And so I think that's - I think your commentary is reasonable. Gary Bisbee : And then just thinking sequentially as we've moved over the last few months. Are you hearing anything different from your clients in the U.S. and Canada around the macro backdrop? Some of the forecasts for GDP growth in the U.S. are moderating, some of the industrial activities moderated a bit, though employment continues to be good. But any change in dialog or is it really steady as she goes? Mike Hansen : Yes. We haven't heard much of a change from our customers and our first quarter results would kind of show that. When we think about the economic picture though as we move in - the last two quarters of our fiscal year are going into mid calendar '20. We do think about the noises around interest rates, the noises - the continued noises around trade and tariffs. We're going to be entering an election year where there is going to be a lot of noise, and I would say, we look today with a little bit more cautiousness than maybe earlier in the summer. And while we haven't seen much change from our customers yet, we're keeping our eyes on it because there's just so much noise in the environment today. Gary Bisbee : And then just lastly, can you give us a sense, how much of the All Other segment is Fire versus Uniform sales? And really the reason I ask is, I think a lot of people have always just plugged in low single-digit growth because uniforms was always bigger, but it sounds like Fire keeps growing. Is that, understanding this volatility quarter-to-quarter, is it possible, that's really more should be a mid-single digit type grower, all in given that Fire is growing quickly and Uniform fairly moderately? Is that a fair assumption? And if you could give us the mix that would be great? Thank you. Paul Adler : Gary, it's Paul. I think that even in our 10-K, we actually have to break - I think the revenue recognition adoption of that FASB caused us to provide more detail. So you can take a look at the last 10-K and you'll see it. But my recollection is - and doing the math the last time that Fire is kind of like about 55% of the mix at this point in time, 45% then is the Direct sale business. And then to your point, we've tried to add some color that the Fire business is high single digits, 10% organic, whereas that Direct sale business is typically around 3%. Fire - the Fire business had a very good quarter. It improved gross margins and improved operating margins. But to your point, because of the fact that we lump those together for the accounting guidance, and we call it All Other, it blends this particular quarter to a little bit of a shrink in the gross margin by I think 10 basis points that was. But if that's more due to the - the mix shift and the fact that the direct sale business grew 5.8% and it shifts that mix and could cause that to move. But if you parse those two businesses out, Fire business actually improved their margins as I said. Operator : Our next question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Seth Weber : Wanted to ask about working capital, it came down nicely relative to first quarter last year. Do you think you can kind of flip the negative? I think it was 2.60 or 2.75 or so for 2019. Do you think you can flip that all the way back to par this year? Or can you just talk to how you're thinking about working capital for 2020? Thanks. Mike Hansen : Yes, when we - our thoughts on working capital are when we are growing, we're going to use some working capital. So for example, if we're growing the way we want to grow. Accounts receivable is going to grow. Inventories are going to grow, in-service inventory is going to grow because we are injecting new inventory into new customers and penetrated customers. So generally speaking, we expect in a growth environment, we expect to use working capital. Now last year, in the first quarter, our use of working capital was quite larger than it was this year in the first quarter. So we were in the midst of a lot of system integration activity, a lot of G&K integration activity, and so we had some disruption in the accounts receivable environment. We feel really good about where we are today. And so you've seen a little bit of a less of a usage there, from an inventory perspective last year and an in-service inventory last year. When we make an acquisition like G&K, there are points in time at which we are going through inventory a little bit more quickly because we're transitioning out of legacy G&K inventory into Cintas types of inventory. Now that didn't happen all at once in the first quarter last year, but it certainly picked up. It continues today but certainly at a lesser pace. And so that's - there was a little bit disruption last year in the first quarter, a little bit more of a steady state this year in the first quarter, but we would expect continued use as long as we can continue to grow. Seth Weber : So the balance of the year probably look something like the balance of 2Q through - the balance of last year then. Is that a fair way to think about it? Mike Hansen : Seth, I don't have the balance of last year right in front of me, but I would - generally speaking, yes. We wouldn't expect any - anything of a disruptive nature in those areas. Seth Weber : And then just follow up on the SG&A, I appreciate you calling out there were some extra expenses there for the quarter. So would you expect, assuming those don't recur SG&A to be down then year-over-year for the rest of the year? Yeah. Mike Hansen : That certainly is our - yeah that certainly is our expectation. From a self-insurance standpoint, we've had quarters in the past where we'll see one time claims pop up and it results in a little bit of a higher insurance, medical expense than normal. Those may continue to happen. But generally speaking, we expect to see some nice leverage in SG&A, particularly from the G&A side of things. Paul mentioned that labor, G&A labor was down a little bit and we are very pleased with that. So we'll have disruptions from quarter-to-quarter. Generally speaking, we do expect leverage, no doubt. Seth Weber : And just, sorry, one last one for Paul, is tax rate kind of consistent here then for the balance of the year just spread evenly 2Q to 4Q? Paul Adler : Yes, that's reasonable, Seth, but it's just that Q1 that is so - such an outlier because of the stock option exercises. So I think that's good for modeling for the remainder of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Going back to organic revenue trends. How much of the acceleration in the quarter would you say is due to traction with penetration of the no programmer market versus improving adds, stops or easing competitive trends that you're seeing? Mike Hansen : Yes, George, not a lot of difference from a normal quarter from the standpoint of new business continues to be strong, productivity from our reps was really good. And within that new business, set was a good no programmer performance. So new business continues to lead the growth effort. From adds, stops nothing to call out really. But, as I mentioned earlier, pricing in the quarter did help similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. So a little bit, certainly year-over-year help in that regard as well. So real nice sales productivity, little bit of pricing help, real nice execution from our partners. George Tong : Your gross margins are continuing to improve across your segments. Can you elaborate on how your input costs are evolving and what your latest thoughts are around the impact of trade negotiations on the business? Mike Hansen : Yes. So from a material costing standpoint, we haven't seen a lot of change right now. It seems like the trade and tariff conversation is more conversation than impact at this point, but it's still creating a lot of noise and uncertainty for our customers and us to a certain extent. But I haven't seen much of an impact. Keep in mind from a material perspective, most of our material costs get amortized over some period of time, whether it's the life of a garment or the life of a mat, and that amortization period really helps. It's a bit of a natural hedging that helps us smooth those kind of cost out. But I would say no costs to call out from that regard. Labor, we've talked over the course of the last year, we've seen it some pressure in pockets, and didn't see anything new or different in this quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann with RW Baird. Andrew Wittmann : I just had a couple of maybe clarifying questions here. First just on the guidance, I think you guys - obviously the tax rate was low. We expected it to be low. I don't think you guys expected it to be quite this low. I'm just wondering how much of the tax rate was incremental or part of the guidance raise just to tease that element out of the total rates here versus your prior expectation? Mike Hansen : Yes, I would say in the quarter it was about a $0.06 impact, for the year, probably about an $0.08 impact. And look, the - so much of that impact that we speak of is kind of out of our control. Well you've heard us talk about the equity piece of that and that's what kind of played out - that played the role in the first quarter here. Andrew Wittmann : And then just on SAP, in the past you've talked about how well rolled out or how thoroughly rolled out that is. Can you just kind of update us as to where we were either at the end of the quarter or where we stand today, Mike? Mike Hansen : Yes, Andrew. It's - we're about 75% of the way complete now. And so we're still on track to finish that implementation by the end of the fiscal year. Andrew Wittmann : And then just for other detail here. You did some pretty good amount of buyback in the quarter. Can you give the total number of shares that you bought in and how much is remaining on the authorization that you currently have in place? Mike Hansen : Yes. During the quarter, we - well, we have $263 million left on the authorization. We bought 837,000 shares for just under $200 million. Keep in mind that all of that purchasing was done prior to our July call. So it was - it did not have an impact on with the guidance that we gave you today. Andrew Wittmann : And then I guess just the only other question I had was specific around labor. You talked about SG&A kind of labor savings, but in the gross margin in the plant, this has been an area that's been cited maybe more by some of your competitors, but you guys have talked about it a little bit as well. I was just wondering if there is any changes that you've seen in the marketplace for your plant-level labor and how you're dealing with that today, if there is something to be dealt with? Mike Hansen : Well, you're right. We've talked a little bit about pressures here and there in pockets particularly in that production and plant environment. And I would say, we didn't see much of a change. It remains a competitive environment and we got to do - the best thing we can do is, is keep our turnover - our partner turnover as low as possible. And we've been pretty successful at that. So I know, not much of a change in this first quarter compared to what we've seen over the course of the last year. Operator : Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel, Nicolaus. Shlomo Rosenbaum : You're talking about M&A earlier in the call. Have you guys ever purchased a company that had unionized labor force and is that something that would be a non-starter for you? Or is that something that you would still entertain, if there is a lot of synergy potential? Mike Hansen : Well, Shlomo, G&K had about 20% union workforce when we acquired them. A union environment, a different culture, it certainly creates a different type of environment to operating environment and those kind of things can tend to make synergy capture a little bit more challenging. And so at the end of the day, would we evaluate something with a heavy union component? You know that's a value consideration more than anything else. And we'd have to take a good hard look at it, because it does complicate the synergy capture opportunity. But there is - that's a part of the conversation around value and consideration. Shlomo Rosenbaum : And then, did I hear you right that you did not buyback any more stock after the last earnings call? Mike Hansen : Correct. Shlomo Rosenbaum : And then could you just - is that usually - usually when companies don't buyback stock and their leverage is below the level that the - consider a target level there is usually something that is a potential out there, is that an unfair assumption for us to make that there might be something in the near to intermediate term? Mike Hansen : Well, Shlomo, we've always looked at that buyback as we've executed as an opportunistic program. And if you go back over the course of the last 10 years, we are not consistent from quarter-to-quarter and that's by design. We kind of look at a bunch of different things. We look at the performance of the business, the investment needs of the business. We look at M&A opportunities on the horizon. We look at things like upcoming dividends and we have a consistent history of not being consistent in the way that we execute on that buyback program. And I'm not sure I look into anything more than that. Shlomo Rosenbaum : And then if you just look at kind of the margins of the business. The First Aid and Safety had really good growth, margin expansion was not a whole lot there. Is there a lot of investment going on in terms of building out routes or anything like that that you're not seeing more leverage here? Mike Hansen : Well, we had a real nice gross margin quarter with the gross margin being up 110 basis points. And so we're with that growth, we are continuing to invest in routes and in capacity. But really you're right Shlomo, from an investment standpoint, we did continue to invest in the SG&A space. And so we do see a little bit of an elevated SG&A number compared to last year. Keep in mind, they are also affected by the medical. And that was about an 80 basis point headwind. But you're right, we are continuing to invest in that business. We do really like it. Shlomo Rosenbaum : And do you mind just going over the days in each quarter year-over-year? So we get that straight for the next three quarters. Mike Hansen : Yes Shlomo, it's 65 in each quarter of this fiscal year. And then, let's see, compared to '19. So we had 66 in Q1 last year, then 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3, and 66 in Q4. Operator : Our next question will come from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Thanks very much. Scott Schneeberger : I just want to hone in a little bit more on pricing, you've mentioned a nice improvement from fourth quarter or at least still solid, which has improved from the third quarter. Could you delve in a little bit to the end markets where you're seeing that pricing improvement. Is there any competitive dynamic that's changed to affect that? And when I speak of end markets, also if you could just specify across the segments too, please. Thanks. Mike Hansen : So from a market by market - from an end market perspective, and nothing to call out of any significance. You've heard us talk a little bit about the pricing environment over the years. When businesses in the rental business are performing well, when they are growing they have limited capacity and it generally tends to add a little bit of more readableness to the pricing environment, and so we do see a little bit of that going on. We also I think do a pretty good job of articulating to our customers, why at times pricing can be appropriate. And so I think that execution has been pretty good as well. So combination of the health of the marketplace, our ability to articulate I think that has combined to a nice environment. Scott Schneeberger : And just following up on, in response to Manav's question early on in the Q&A, you were talking about a new item in the cabinet and how that could have a lumpy effect because the follow-on tapers a bit. I was just curious, how are you doing with opportunities like that rolling out and if you want to share what that new item was, that would be great. But how are you doing with deploying new offerings and servicing - services. And if you could tie that into G&K and if you're seeing any cross-sell benefit from there, that would be great? Thanks. Mike Hansen : We do - we are seeing some cross-sell opportunities and benefits like we have over the course of the last year. And, but I would say generally speaking and we'd rather not call out that specific item, but generally speaking, we're always looking and investing for ancillary products ways that we can add some value for our customers. And so in this case, it was a nice benefit. Sometimes those happen in a particular quarter and didn't happen last year, they can be lumpy in terms of when the roll-outs occur, but we like where we are in terms of our ability to create those ancillary products within our businesses. That's what - we've talked many times about the umbrellas of image safety, cleanliness and compliance and when we think broadly like that with our customers, sometimes, we're able to come up with some pretty nice and unique ideas and we've been - we've had some success over the course of the last year, and that would go for legacy G&K customers as well as into legacy Cintas customers. We've had some nice success. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan Securities. Andrew Steinerman : It's Andrew. Could you give a quick comment on merchandise amortization, was it a headwind or a tailwind in the first quarter? And given the strong new wins, do you feel like merchandise amortization will be more of a drag going forward to margins? Mike Hansen : Yes, right. No, there was nothing to call out in that regard during the quarter. We are in an interesting time as I was mentioning earlier Andrew, where we've injected a decent amount of new Cintas product into legacy G&K customers, and that can create some rippling and we're going to see a little bit of that as we move forward, but less of it today than a year ago I would say. As we move forward, we're going to continue to sell, hopefully a lot of new business, and so we'll continue to inject at pretty good rates. But again, I would say nothing to call out. Our managers are managing the inventory and the in-service pretty well. Andrew Steinerman : Can I ask as you do inject, excuse me, inject Cintas uniforms into the G&K customer base, do they notice the - that there is a quality upgrade there? Mike Hansen : We certainly would like to think so, I mean, when we look at the inventory, Andrew, our people understand the features and the functionality of the inventory in the garments that we have. And they are trained to point those features and functions out to our customers. So as long as we are doing our job and introducing those garments and introducing those prominent features and functions of them, I'm expecting that the customers certainly notice. Operator : All right, thank you. And at this time there are no further questions in the queue. Mike Hansen : Well. Thank you for joining us tonight. We will issue our second quarter financial results in December and we look forward to speaking you - speaking with you again at that time. Good night. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect. Please, enjoy the rest of your day.",

And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Hansen : Good evening. And thank you for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our second quarter results for fiscal 2020. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was a record $1.84 billion, an increase of 7.3% over last year's second quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was also 7.3%. In the second quarter of fiscal '20, the organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 5.8%, and the organic growth rate for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment was 10.6%. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '20 of $852.4 million increased 10%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 46.2% for the second quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 45.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '19. Uniform Rental and Facility Services' operating segment gross margin as a percentage of revenue improved 130 basis points from last year's second quarter to 46.6%, and the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment gross margin improved 40 basis points to 48.4%. Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal '20 of $334.5 million increased 21.3%. Operating margin was 18.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 16% in fiscal '19. Operating income in the second quarter of fiscal '19 was impacted by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition of $7.8 million or 50 basis points. Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '20 was $246.4 million and reported earnings per diluted share were $2.27. Excluding the one-time gain on the sale of a cost method investment and the G&K acquisition integration expenses, both in fiscal '19, EPS increased 29%. As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer who's quoted in today's earnings press release, we are pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date performance. We thank our employee partners for continuing to execute well and take great care of our customers. In addition to the strong financial performance, we continue to generate strong cash flow and commit to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. On December 6th, we paid an annual dividend of $2.55 per share, an increase of 24.4% over last year's annual dividends. We've increased the dividend for 36 consecutive years. In the past 10 years, the annual dividend per share increased at a compound annual growth rate of 18.2%. Before turning the call over to Paul for more details, I'll provide an update of our fiscal '20 expectations. We have increased our expectations of financial performance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $7.29 billion to $7.33 billion. We expect EPS to be in the range of $8.65 to $8.75. Note the following regarding the guidance. The growth rate at the revenue guidance range is 5.8% for 6.4%. However, our fiscal '20 contains one less workday than our fiscal '19. Adjusting for this one day difference, on a constant workday basis, the revenue growth rate range at guidance is 6.2% to 6.8%. One less workday also has a negative impact on EPS, reducing it about $0.06, which is 90 basis points drag on the EPS growth rate. Adjusting for this, the EPS growth rate range is 14.7% to 16%. Guidance assumes an effective tax rate for fiscal '20 of 19.2% compared to a rate of 19.7% for fiscal '19. Keep in mind that the tax rate can move up or down from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. It assumes a share counts for computing EPS of 109 million shares. This consists of diluted weighted average shares outstanding plus participating securities in the form of restricted stock. The guidance does not assume any future share buybacks or any additional G&K integration expenses. I'll now turn the call over Paul. Paul Adler : Thank you, Mike. Please note that our fiscal '20 contains one less workday than in fiscal '19. One less day will negatively impact fiscal '20 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. To illustrate the magnitude of the headwinds, using fiscal '19's annual revenue, one less workday equates to about $27 million. One less workday also has a negative impact on operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '20 operating income margin will be reduced by about 12.5 basis points in comparison to fiscal '19 due to one less day of revenue. The negative impact on the margin occurs because certain expenses, like amortization of uniforms and entrance mats, are expensed on a monthly basis as opposed to on a daily basis. And we will have one less day of revenue to cover the expenses. As Mike stated, one less workday is a headwind of about 90 basis points on EPS growth, and about a $0.06 drag on total EPS in comparison to fiscal '19. Each quarter of fiscal '20 contains 65 workdays. In comparison to fiscal '19, our upcoming Q3 of fiscal '20 will have one additional day, and our Q4 will have one less day. Please keep the quarterly day differences in mind when modeling our fiscal '20 results. We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All-Other. All-Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All-Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on ramp. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.47 billion, an increase for 5.7%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 5.8%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 46.6% for the second quarter compared to 45.3% in last year's second quarter, an improvement of 130 basis points. Operating Income margin was a record 19.5% for the second quarter and it was 19% year-to-date. Profit margins have strengthened for many reasons including strong revenue growth and realization of profit synergies from the acquisition of G&K. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segments includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. The segment's revenue for the second quarter was $169.7 million. The organic growth rate for the segment was 10.6%. The First Aid segment gross margin was 14.4% in the second quarter compared to 14% in masters second quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. First Aid segment gross margins continued to increase with strong revenue growth. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in all other categories. Our fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. Uniform Direct Sale business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Uniform Direct Sale, however, is a key business for us and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross sell and provide products and service from our other business units. All Other revenue was $204.1 million, an increase of 17.2%. The organic growth rate was 16.5%. The Fire business organic growth rate was 9.6%. Uniform Direct Sales business saw an exceptionally strong quarter, posting an organic growth rate of 25%. Growth was driven in large part due to the rollout of Carhartt branded garments to a Fortune 100 customer. All Other gross margin was 41.8% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 41.2% last year. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '20 and 28.6% in the second quarter of fiscal '19. Improvement was realized in many areas, including lower G&A labor expense as a percentage of revenue. Last quarter, we mentioned that medical expense as a percent of revenue spiked. It came back in line in the second quarter as we expected. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '20 was 20.1%. Stock based compensation positively impacted the tax rate. As Mike stated earlier, the tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Our cash and equivalents balance as of November 30th was $226.5 million. Year-to-date, operating cash flow increased about 66% from last year, because of strong earnings growth and improvements in working capital, particularly accounts receivable, inventories, uniforms and other rental items in service and accounts payable. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $61.4 million. Our CapEx by operating segments was as follows; $48.6 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $10.8 million in First Aid and Safety, and $2 million in All Other. We expect fiscal '20 CapEx to be in a range of $265 million to $290 million. As of November 30th, total debt was $2,738.4 million. $2,538.6 million was fixed interest rate debt and $199.8 million was variable rate debt in the form of a term loan. At November 30th, our leverage was 1.8 times debt-to-EBITDA. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Toni Kaplan at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Toni Kaplan : You had a pretty solid beat in the quarter, but only a modest 2% raise for the full year. Could you just talk about your expectations around maybe the broader macro and anything else that might be one-time in the quarter, or might reverse as we go through the year? Just wondering why not a bigger raise? Thanks. Mike Hansen : And Toni, you are speaking of revenue right now. Correct? Toni Kaplan : Yes. Mike Hansen : And so, from a -- let's talk about the quarter. We had a very good quarter. The -- all of our businesses grew, and in particular our direct sale business had a really nice quarter. Toni, you'd asked a little bit about the macro first. And I would say not a lot of change during the quarter. We did say at the beginning of the quarter that energy, we were starting to see a little bit of softness in the energy area. We did see a little bit of that during the quarter. In fact, we had one fairly good sized customer in the space go bankrupt. But I would say, the other thing is, industrials are a bit choppy, generally speaking. Having said that, not a lot of change during the quarter. We are encouraged, as we kind of forward, we are encouraged that we've -- it looks like we've made some progress in the USMCA and China trade and we're encouraged by the movement there and we look forward to getting those results. It seems like we seen a little bit of a steady direction out of the Fed on interest rates. And so, as we leave the second quarter, I would say there are some encouraging signs, but there's still we're entering the election year, there still is a lot going on in terms of the noise in the marketplace, and whether or not small business and other businesses will continue to invest. And so we still look a little bit with caution as we think about the second half of the year. As it relates to the guidance, look, we had a very good first half of the year. Our partners did a great job, and the year is playing out generally as we expected. We had growth of roughly 7%. Organic growth of over 7% for the first half of the year, but we also have some things that went our way. I talked a little bit about this in the first quarter where rental probably got a little bit of year-over-year benefit in the first quarter and that certainly helped as we kind of were finding the bottom last year in our rental business as we've lapped the G&K acquisition. So again, a little bit of benefit in the first half there. We talked about pricing being incrementally positive in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, maybe not quite as incrementally positive in the second quarter but certainly, some benefit in the first half of the year. I would expect that that we'll fall back into kind of the pricing range we've been in the last few years. When you think about the Direct Sale business, we talked about that, we referred of that a few times, had a great year in the first half. In the second half, our expectation is, as this business can be lumpy that we'll be flat to down in that. And so just that alone is about 75 basis points of growth impact when you compare the first half to the second half. I talked a little bit about the outlook on the macro. And so as we think about the second half, we're thinking about the macro. We're thinking about -- there are some things that really went well in the first half, may not get all of that benefit in the second half. Having said all of that, look, it's -- our same work day growth is 6.2 to 6.8, and the year is shaping up pretty much the way we expected it to. And if we can hit those kind of numbers, that's a really nice year for us. Toni Kaplan : And just wanted to ask about buybacks, you really pulled back pretty dramatically this quarter. Just wanted to get some color around, how we should be thinking about any sort of change to capital deployment philosophy, or just why it's very minimal buybacks this quarter? Mike Hansen : Yes, we do have -- we've got the authorization of about 1.2 billion. And we look at that, as we talked about, we look at that opportunistically. One thing to keep in mind is we, in the first week of December, we made $268 million payment related to our dividend, and we also have some debt interest payments. So we're back into CP in the month of December, but we will look at the buyback opportunistically as we move through the rest of the year. And specifically to your question, we have not made any changes to the way we think about capital allocation. Operator : We will now take the next question from Hamzah Mazari at Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hamzah Mazari : My first question is just on the SAP rollout sort of just any update there. Specifically, where do you see benefits once that's rolled out in April or May next year? Is that going to be an organic growth through cross-selling, or do we see sort of SG&A come off? Any color as to benefits of that rollout? Mike Hansen : Hamza, we're about 85% of the way through our SAP journey at this point in time, so we've made some good progress in the quarter. And we're still on track to complete the project by the end of the fiscal year. As far as benefits are concerned, I think the benefits from SAP are going to be kind of throughout the P&L. We've talked about some of them already that that can be achieved by locations individually, better technology in the hands of the people providing the services, better information at their disposal, the ability for our accounting and finance people and operations people to look at data from the very back of the house all the way to invoicing and pricing with the customer. But then there are other benefits to that that we believe will be benefiting the top-line later on and more perhaps impactfully when the entire network is in the system. But certainly, we believe that putting the Uniform Rental business and our First Aid business in the same operating system will foster more collaboration, more cross-selling, which will help the top-line. And just better, as I mentioned earlier, use the data, looking at our big, large national accounts, from city-to-city-to city to do analyses and make sure that we're getting all the entitled revenue that we should for the agreements, make sure the pricing is appropriate for the contract. So lots of opportunities, but not able to quantify anything at this point in time. As I said, we'll complete that rollout this fiscal year and have more color next fiscal year for you. Hamzah Mazari : And just a follow-up question and I'll turn it over. When you think about M&A outside of core Uniform Rental and the businesses you're in. What are some of the metrics you're looking at? I know you want to touch more businesses. I assume it's our base. Does it have to be accretive to growth, accretive to margin? I know you guys just did shred it a long time ago and that business got sold. We did G&K that was part of the core. Just any color as to metrics you can share, how you think of our larger M&A outside the core? Thank you. Mike Hansen : First of all, we work for B2B. We love the recurring revenue nature of our kinds of businesses. Route based is preferred but it's not absolutely necessary. The key is what kind of service, can we add to provide some level of value to the customer. So that's the real key. We would want it to be an opportunity that can add value to many of our customers, not just a small subset, and we would want it to have margin potential. So you asked, does it need to be growth accretive and margin accretive. We certainly would love it to be, but there really aren't that many out there, we're looking hard for them. But those are the kind of things that we will look for. Recurring revenue streams, can it benefit our current customers, is it a large opportunity for us, or is it very narrow, what's the service component. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Manav Patnaik at Barclays. Please go ahead. Manav Patnaik : My first question is just can you just walk us through why the lower CapEx assumption and then maybe just some context when you look at the -- over the next two to three years, I guess where are your greatest investment means? Mike Hansen : We -- generally, we are making our CapEx in terms of our growth opportunities, like new routes and then -- and adding capacity. I would say we continue to add the routes. So in other words, buying trucks and that is certainly important for us. But as it relates to laundry capacity, for example, we've got some really interesting projects that are going on that that we think can help us out in certain cases. And so, we're seeing a little bit of a benefit because of that. I've talked a little bit about G&K auto source that that's kind of a quasi auto source that helps us in certain facilities. And we're moving on rolling out some of those kind of things. We're looking at things like efficiency in the wash alley. And then we certainly still have a little bit of the capacity that we have gotten from the G&K acquisition. So, the combination of all of those things has created efficiency opportunities for us, particularly in the production environment, and you're seeing a little bit of that benefit in our gross margin. Manav Patnaik : And then just in terms of G&K and maybe tied to the SAP implementation. Are there systems I guess on SAP as well? And is it still too hard for you guys to quantify any revenue synergies that you might be getting from that deal? Mike Hansen : Well, keep in mind we converted all G&K locations to either the Cintas SAP system or the legacy Cintas system, so that we could fully get off of that system. And that was completed, gosh, probably over a year ago. And so we still have some of those that need to get from the Cintas legacy system to SAP. And so we inserted those locations as it made sense into the SAP rollout. And so we're almost there. Paul said we're 85% of the way there in total in terms of the conversion and we made good progress. So we have a pretty good handle on in terms of viewing the G&K legacy locations in much the same way that we're viewing the Cintas location. And so we see some benefits, so I would call them anecdotal. We need to get all the way on SAP before we really start taking advantage of the power of that information. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Andrew Steinerman at JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrew Steinerman : Mike, you mentioned that you just treat G&K legacy locations like Cintas locations. Want to know about the inventory? I mean, how much of the uniforms today are still the G&K uniforms? And when you convert over and introduce Cintas uniforms, which are presumably better uniforms. G&K legacy customers, how they responded and has there been a price adjustment since they are getting better uniforms? Mike Hansen : From an inventory conversion standpoint, we are in the midst of that. And those happened at different such times, Andrew. So for example, if we have a customer that's got 10 wears, for example, in legacy G&K inventory, we maybe in a style where as they turn, in other words, as they have turnover and they replace their open positions with new hires and we put them into legacy G&K current garments, there's going to be a point in time at which we run out of those garments, whether it's the style or the size. And that happens at very different intervals depending on the kind of garment that they have. And so it is a customer-by-customer approach. When they start to run out of -- when we start to run out of G&K legacy garments, we will start to put them into Cintas garments and generally, that can be all at once, because we don't want them to have different looks. But as I said, that is a customer-by-customer decision point based on the style. So, it's really hard to give you a full percentage, because it's happening all over the country. We are not finished with that. We are still working our way through G&K legacy inventory. When they get on to Cintas inventory, as you know, pricing becomes a customer-by-customer conversation as well. And there may be some where we -- there is no change at all and we put them in something that's, let's say, at a work wear type of a garment. There may be others where we give them an opportunity to upgrade into a Carhartt garment, for example. And in that case, there may be times where we will increase the pricing, or adjust the pricing as its necessary. So it is a customer-by-customer decision on when to convert and then it's also a customer-by-customer decision on what does that pricing and what does that contract look like. Andrew Steinerman : And do you think the customer recognizes that the Cintas uniform on average is a better uniform than the legacy uniforms they had? Mike Hansen : I can give you anecdotally, the answer is yes. We need to be doing a pretty good job of showing why they're moving into a Cintas garment, and what are the features and functions of that new garment. It may be that it's softer, it may be that it little bit better, it maybe that is -- that the fabric breath is a little bit better. And generally when we explain those kinds of features to the customer, they get it and they understand. And it doesn't take very long for them to be in those garments to recognize that there's a quality difference. Operator : We'll now take the next question from Gary Bisbee at Bank of America. Please go ahead. Gary Bisbee : I guess the first question from me, just the Uniform Rental revenue slowed somewhat, obviously, at a much tougher comp, but anything other than that. I guess you mentioned a little weaker energy, anything other than that you would call out as sequential deceleration in the organic constant currency revenue growth? Mike Hansen : Yes, I don't think it's anything of real significance. But I would point to the three things I mentioned earlier; a little bit of the absence of that lapping; a little bit of the choppiness in the energy and maybe industrials, generally; and pricing maybe wasn't quite as incrementally positive as we've seen in previous two quarters. I think those things kind of capture what we saw in the quarter. Still a good quarter for us, but I think those things capture. Gary Bisbee : And then you have been asked for a few years about cross-sell potential, both with G&K and just more broadly against your different businesses. And I realized you don't have the data and haven't provided real granular color. But, can you give us any sense like as your salespeople for the main business go out, how often are they targeting people that are customers through your other businesses? How important is cross-sell in terms of how you are trying to compensate the different types of sales people? Is it really something you focused a lot on to-date or should we think that the data that SAP will provide is really going to be the key to unlocking that more broadly? Mike Hansen : We do spend a lot of time with that today, Gary. You know our SSRs are looking for opportunities. We have our, we call them market development reps, who are looking at that some of our more complex customers and looking for upsell and penetration opportunities there. And we've become a bit better at cross-sell between Rental and First Aid and Fire. I think we still have some ways to go there to take advantage of all of that opportunity. But we are starting to spend more time than in the past. So it has been important to us. And I think we've been doing a pretty good job at that over the last two years, including in the last probably 18 months with G&K legacy customers. But having said that, SAP will unlock some additional potential that is going to be something that should prove to be a nice opportunity for us. Gary Bisbee : And then just one more, the initiative have been next quarter or anything like that, but as we think out of the next few years in sort of a normalized economy. How are you thinking about incremental operating margins these days? What's the potential? They have been obviously terrific the last two years, particularly as the G&K savings have flown through. But what's like a long-term target or opportunity there? Mike Hansen : We still like -- we talk a lot about incrementals of 20% to 30%. We're getting pretty darn close to the bottom of that with our rental division. But as we continue to get success with penetration opportunities, to get success in some of the verticals that can be even bigger types of customers with a service opportunity that's more efficient, we think there are still opportunities. And that incremental, as we move forward, we think that incremental certainly is in the 20% to 30%. And if we can capitalize on some of those different things that we've talked about, the penetration, the sales into these customers with maybe more efficient service aspects, the capacity efficiencies, we think we can get that incremental into that mid-20 type of a neighborhood. So it's a nice opportunity that looks -- that we look forward to. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Andrew Wittmann at RW Baird. Please go ahead. Andrew Wittmann : Yes, I was looking at the two year growth rate stack in your Rental segment. It looks like the comps prove out at 12.4 over the last two years, both for the first quarter and the second quarter. But kind of brings me to the question you've talked about in the past, which is your sales force productivity. You mentioned the kind of the headwind for the deceleration in the growth rate. But I was just wondering how the sales force is performing for you? I think it was not that many quarters ago, you said even the G&K people that you kept on were producing at record levels. Can you just give us an update, Mike, about what you're seeing out of them in terms of the ability to add for those new customers? Mike Hansen : Yes, when we think about total, look, we have one sales team. And so that sales team continues to perform well. And they're doing a nice job of adding customers and selling into existing customers. Their productivity levels are still, this quarter was a little bit higher than last year in this quarter. So, we're still making some really nice improvements. So we are still very pleased with the sales rep productivity. Andrew Wittmann : And then I guess I wanted to maybe, Paul, if you can just help us a little bit on some of the elements of cost structure. I think typically you've given energy as a percentage of your rental segment revenue. How much of a benefit was that? And just any other details that you can call in the cost structure? I think, labor has been something that people have flagged, maybe that would be something you've addressed. You mentioned health care that is back to normal. But just anything else you can help us understand the moving pieces inside the margins, I think could be helpful? Paul Adler : Yes, Andy. Energy was a 20 basis points benefits year-over-year, flat sequentially. So, I think that's -- if oil continues the price per barrel in the second half where it is in the first half, it will be little bit of a tailwind for us and the cost structure in the second half. Labor, I would say overall in checks, we talked about, gosh, it was probably a year ago now about certain areas of our workforce, particularly in the production area, we were having some labor inflation and we've made some changes. So we believe that that is behind us, and we won't have to make any further adjustments there. But otherwise, inflation is normal, I would say. It's something that we've been able to deal with. It's certainly tight, but it hasn't prevented us from running the business and serving our customers. Mike Hansen : Yes. And Andy, when you think about our gross margins, for example, we've seen some really nice year-over-year improvement in this first half of the year. And certainly, the growth levels have been good and that helps. So, we're getting really nice leverage. Our sales people are productive and they're selling good profitable business, and that's been good. And we are -- we've done a nice job of capturing the G&K synergies. But what we're also seeing a little bit of is, as we've talked about over the last few years, there is a lot of inefficiency in running the facilities when you're going through a lot of conversion of incorporating G&K volumes into Cintas legacy plants and closing those plants and rebarcoding inventory. And there's a lot of work that goes on there. And really what we've seen in the first half of the year is we've captured those G&K synergies just as we wanted them to. And we've seen some real nice efficiency gains, because there are quite as many of those projects going on, those are a little bit more in the past. And so our -- we've -- the timing for us has been kind of fortunate and good from the standpoint of when we were seeing a little bit of pressure in our production labor, for example, we were also making some synergies and capturing some synergies there too. And we've been able to get more efficient in this first half of the year, and I think that's a little bit of what you're seeing. Operator : And we'll now take next question from Scott Schneeberger at Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Daniel Hultberg : It's Daniel on for Scott. You discussed efficiencies earlier. Could you provide a little bit more perspective on some type of efficiencies to pursue want to go-forward basis besides the route optimization and a little bit color on automation of processes and use the advanced technology and how that is applied and where you could go there with? Thank you. Mike Hansen : Sure. We are always looking for them. And so when we think about efficiencies going forward, I've talked a little bit about capacity. How can we continue to get more efficient in terms of using our Wash Alley, some of that is automation, I'm sorry, technology and some of that is a Six Sigma like process improvement there are opportunities there. We still have a lot of route optimization to go, that is both a little bit of technology, but just its customer touching and so we're being cautious in that regard. We've talked about getting through the SAP conversion and as we are able to then pull off of the legacy Cintas system a bit. That's going to create some efficiency just that because we won't have duplicate systems, but also then using that technology for things like sales rep productivity gains and cross-selling and penetration opportunities, so that we do have a number of those different efficiency opportunities as well as then just typically the Six Sigma processes that we're always working on and how can we get better and as the business changes can we get more efficient in the way we move product and through our plants and provide services. We're looking at all of those different things, but we think we've got some nice opportunities ahead. Daniel Hultberg : Switching gears a little bit, cotton price has been down in the first half of this fiscal year on a year-over-year basis. Could you please discuss half of that is impacting earnings. I mean I know historically you've smooth that out through amortization, but how is that really impacting your earnings presently? Thank you. Mike Hansen : Not really any impact in the first half of this year. We are, as you mentioned, it takes a while for that cotton price to ripple through into our P&L, if we have to sell the garments, we have to bring the garments into our distribution center. We then ship them from our distribution centers out to our rental locations, and at that point they start an 18 months amortization process, so it takes a while. And then even when it does get through, we're generally smoothing that out as you said, because we've got, if we see a spike for a few months, you might have 118 fourth of that in one month, you may could have two or 318th fourth of that. It's got to be sustained movement in that before it really starts to hit us and keep in mind cotton isn't a -- it's not one of the more significant pieces of our cost structure. So if you think about our cost structure, our cost of rentals is you can think of it in three buckets, one is material cost, one is production, part of this running of our laundry facilities and the third is our service costs, so the routing. The cotton piece is then part of that material cost, but that material cost includes also the labor content to serve garments, the freight on the garments, the trim on the garments, etc. And so it really takes some sustained large movement in cotton before it really starts to impact us. Operator : We'll take the next question from George Tong at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. George Tong : Your revenue outlook has certainly improved from where it was a quarter ago, you discussed the macro factors that are impacting this, but can you elaborate on some internal initiatives where you're seeing traction that improves your revenue expectations for the full year? Mike Hansen : Well, there they are -- things generally George that, that we've been working on for a while and that is we are looking to continuously focus on some of the verticals that have been really powerful for us. So for example, the healthcare vertical, the education government hospitality, those places where the sales are a little bit more complex, the purchasing decisions might be a little bit more complex and we've made some really good progress in those areas and we still are in the early innings and think there are great opportunities as we move ahead. And so those are areas that are really important to us. The penetration, I mentioned that we have been working more on the penetration opportunities. I think we can get better and more opportunities ahead for that area as well and that penetration is both better coordination between our businesses, but also taking advantage of our newer products and making sure we're getting things like check works in front of all of the right decision makers. And so it's really continuing to move forward with what we believe to be our unique products that create opportunity in the marketplace. We are doing the same kinds of things in our First Aid and Safety business where we are looking for those penetration opportunities, product adjacencies are great and continue to look for larger national type customers as well, in both First Aid and our Fire businesses. So we're doing all of those things. We've made some really nice progress. And we think we've got a really nice year ahead of us as we move into the second half. George Tong : Your gross margins expanded about 110 basis points year-over-year in the quarter, can you discuss how much pricing contributed to this margin expansion and how sustainable pricing increases are at the current pace? Mike Hansen : Pricing, certainly has an impact, I mentioned that it wasn't quite incrementally positive in this quarter as it had been in the previous two quarters. And so I would say the pricing is somewhat in line with what we've seen over the last couple of years, absent the last couple of quarters. Generally, we've been able to when we can show value and when we can have the right conversations with our customers. Generally, we've been able to get some pricing and I don't see that necessarily changing. But I would -- as it relates to then the margin opportunity and the margin improvement. It's really more about the growth creates leverage, it creates efficiencies in our plants, when we grow in our rental business in particular where we don't use capacity like our restroom and hygiene products, we effectively get some really nice leverage and get more efficient with the capacity. And in addition to that we've pulled out a little bit of inefficiency in the business, so more of the gross margin improvement relates to the revenue of the business, the leveraging and the efficiencies that we're able to gain. Operator : And we'll take the next question from Kevin McVeigh at Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Kevin McVeigh : Just to follow-up on the guidance a little bit, I know last year there was some severe weather in the third quarter that was kind of unexpected. Do you have any kind of just thoughts on or any allowance for that in the Q3 guide obviously with -- obviously which would be incorporated into the full year or how are you thinking about just the weather impact as we work our way through the back half of the year? Mike Hansen : Last year in the third quarter, we talked a little bit about the weather and the holidays. It's hard to predict the weather. And so we are -- I would say, we're not trying to build in any particular weather pattern. As it relates to the holidays, one of the things we talked about last year was Christmas and New Year's falling on a Tuesday, which was the first time in a number of years and that has an impact. This year, the holidays both fall on a Wednesday, and the last time they fell on a Wednesday, I think it was like our fiscal '14 year. So it's been a bit of a time period since we've had a Wednesday. And so if you think about our weekly flow of volume you can think of it as a bit of a bell curve Monday -- Mondays and Friday's I would call are our, maybe our lower days and our as you go from Monday to Tuesday that when the volume starts to build because customers are just more, they're more easy to see etc. Wednesday tends to be one of our heavier days, and then you start to come back down as you go through the rest of the week. With -- by the holidays, both being on a Wednesday, this year we are considering that we will have any year-over-year benefit because of the comments we made last year during the holidays. We're kind of thinking that look, we're going to still have that holiday disruption a little bit. I don't think it necessarily will be a drag on growth, but it's certainly, it isn't going to help us with an easier comp. Kevin McVeigh : And then just the margins again really nice and if I have it right, it looks like kind of the other category at least outpaced our estimates that can be kind of uniform sales which are lower margin. Is there anything else in there that's helping boost the gross margins overall despite the mix? Mike Hansen : We are continuing to make improvements in the fire business. We really like that business and it has performed very well in the second quarter and in the first half. And as we get bigger and we gain scale and that revenue growth allows us to leverage our infrastructure a bit better. It creates more dense routes and that creates some margin opportunity. We've got a long way to go. But certainly have seen some nice performance in the fire business and certainly the heavy volume in our direct sale business was a bit of a help too. Operator : We will take our next question from Seth Weber at RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Seth Weber : Most of the questions asked and answered, but I wanted to see if we could dig into your -- you've made the pricing comments a few times now, just a little bit less robust than maybe what we saw in the first quarter, is there anything you'd call out, is it a mix issue or the comps just getting harder or is there something going on from a competitive front that you would highlight? Thanks. Mike Hansen : I think it's a bunch of different things, Seth. I think there is a little bit of mix going on. We've had some good performance in a few quarters in a row now, and if that's kind of outperformance isn't sustainable in the long term, and I don't think it's anything that we are concerned about. But just something a little bit of maybe a notch below where we had seen in the last couple of quarters, made up of a number of different things. Seth Weber : And then just on working capital has been frankly better than what we would have thought given the growth trajectory. I mean do you think that working capital can continue to be just a little bit better than normal. Normally, I think you expect to see a little bit more usage here. Has there something you'd call out that's really helping that or can we expect that to continue? Thanks. Mike Hansen : Well, look from a working capital standpoint, we certainly have been in a period of disruption over the last couple of years, as it relates to our accounts receivable converting two systems as it relates to our inventory and shutting down DCs, opening new DCs, converting a lot of volume. And we're starting to get some of those inefficiencies and disruptions behind us. And so for example in accounts receivable, we've seen a nice improvement year-over-year and that's part because we've gotten a little bit of that disruption behind us. There still is some system conversion to go, but we think we're getting a little bit better and better and more efficient at it. If you think about the sort of cash flow for a second, when you think about our operating cash flow, it was pretty strong this quarter and really for the first six months of the year and our conversion of net income to operating cash flow has been over 100%. I would expect that that's going to continue for the second half of the year. Free cash flow was really strong and I think that's going to be strong for the rest of the year. And so I think more than anything Seth, it's getting a little bit of this disruption of two system conversions, a new business conversion, a little bit of that stuff behind us. But as we've talked in the past, when we are growing we're generally going to use some working capital, in other words, we're going to see AR continue to increase. We're going to see, generally speaking, inventory and in service inventories grow over time, inventory is a little bit different from a standpoint of we do have opportunities there, where some of those opportunities will create more inventory. For example, if we believe we can have enough volume to bring new products into our distribution center that may create new inventory. However, as we get more efficient and you get the G&K conversion behind us, that's going to create some forecasting and supply chain opportunities. So there's going to be some ups and downs in that inventory line item, but generally the performance has been good. We've gotten a little bit of that disruption behind us, but we're generally going to be a user of the working capital. Operator : It appears there are no further questions. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to the speakers. Please go ahead. Mike Hansen : Well, thanks very much joining us tonight. We will issue our third quarter financial results in March, and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. And we wish you all happy holidays.",

And at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Sir, please begin. Mike Hansen : Thank you and good evening and thanks for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2020. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Before discussing the financials I want to say that our thoughts go out to all of those impacted by the COVID-19 Coronavirus. This is a challenging time for all of us and we can't enough our partners -- our employees who we call partners for doing all that they can to keep our customers' places of business clean, safe, and ready for the workday. We currently find ourselves at the peak of uncertainty as it relates to the pandemic's impact on the economy. The response of our country and each state involves daily. A week ago, we hadn\u2019t seen much impact to our business, and we were expecting today to increase revenue and EPS guidance based on our year-to-date results and fourth-quarter outlook. However, much has changed in a matter of days and more changes are likely to come. Due to this uncertainty, including the severity and duration of the pandemic, we're not providing guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 at this time. We certainly remain focused though on the safety and well-being of our employee partners and the care of our customers. So let\u2019s move to providing our third quarter results and then we will open it up for questions. Our fiscal 2020 third quarter revenue was $1.81 billion, an increase of 7.6% over last year's third quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations were $2.16, an increase of 17.4% over last year's third quarter adjusted for G&K integration expenses. Free cash flow for this year's third quarter was $300 million, an increase of 17.2%. The organic growth rate which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and differences in the number of workdays was 5.7% for the third quarter of fiscal '20. The organic growth rate for the uniform rental and facility services operating segment was 4.8%, and the organic growth rate for the first aid and safety services operating segment was 12.5%. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal '20 of $824.4 million increased 9.2%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 45.5% for the third quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 44.9% in the third quarter of fiscal '19. Operating income for the third quarter of fiscal '20 of $314.7 million increased 13.1%. Operating margin was 17.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 16.5% in fiscal '19. Net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '20 was $234.5 million and reported earnings per diluted share were $2.16. Excluding the G&K acquisition integration expenses in fiscal '19, EPS increased 17.4%. In addition to the solid financial performance, we continue to generate strong cash flow and commit to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. Third quarter free cash flow was $300 million, an increase of 17.2% compared to last year. In the third quarter of fiscal '20, we paid an annual dividend totaling $268 million. The dividend of $2.55 per share was an increase of 24.4% over last year's annual dividend. In addition to the annual dividend, we purchased $393.1 million as Cintas' stock in fiscal '20 to date including $200 million in March. The amount remaining under our buyback authorization is $1.1 billion. We ended our third quarter with fiscal year to date revenue growth of 7.2% and an organic growth rate of 7.1%. Operating income, excluding last year's G&K integration expenses increased 14.7%. EPS adjusted for last year's special items increased 22.2%. And finally free cash flow for the third quarter year-to-date increased 61%. Our employee partners have really done a great job this year. With that, I will turn the call over to Paul for additional details for our third quarter results. Paul Adler : Thanks Mike. We have two reportable operating segments; uniform rental and facility services and first aid and safety service. The remainder of our business is included in all other. All other consists of fire protection services, and our uniform direct sale business. First aid and safety services and all other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement. The uniform rental and facility services' operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform rental and facility services revenue was $1.45 billion, an increase of 6.6%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes, and the difference in the number of workdays, the organic growth rate was 4.8%. Our uniform rental and facility services' segment gross margin was 45.8% for the third quarter compared to 44.9% in last year's third quarter, an improvement of 90 basis points. Gross margins have strengthened for many reasons, including strong revenue growth and realization of cost synergies from the acquisition of G&K. Our first aid and safety services' operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $170.5 million. The organic growth rate for this segment was 12.5%. The first aid segment gross margin was 48.0% in the third quarter compared to 48.2% in last year's third quarter. The difference in gross margin was due to revenue mix in the quarter, which consists of service, product sales, and training. The strong organic revenue growth benefited from more safety and personal protective equipment product sales, which generally have lower margins than the other revenue categories. Our fire protection services and uniform direct sales businesses are reported in the all other category. Our fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. The uniform direct sale business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility such as when we install a multi-million-dollar account. Uniform direct sale, however, is a key business for us and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross sell and provide products and services from our other business units. All other revenue was $192.1 million an increase of 9.9%. The organic growth rate was 7.1%. The fire business organic growth rate was 4.1%. Fire revenue was way down by the loss of a struggling national account in the retail sector that recently disclosed the closing of over 100 stores by mild winter weather that resulted in less sprinkler repair service revenue from freezing and bursting water pipes and by a decline in sales rep productivity through the Christmas and New Year's holidays. Uniform direct sale business organic growth rate was 11.1% and benefited from additional sales from a rollout last quarter of Carhartt branded garments to a Fortune 100 customer. All other gross margin was 41.3% for the third quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.3% last year. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.2% in the third quarter of fiscal '20 and 28.3% in the third quarter of fiscal '19. G&A labor expense as a percent of revenue improved year-over-year. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '20 was 18.9% compared to 20.1% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Our cash and equivalents balance as of February 29 was $234.4 million. Of that amount $144.7 million was in the United States and unrestricted. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $63.2 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows $50.2 million in uniform rental and facility services, $10.1 million in first aid and safety and $2.9 million in all other. Year-to-date free cash flow was $745.2 million, an increase of 61% compared to the prior year period. Free cash flow increased because of strong earnings growth and improvements in working capital, particularly accounts receivable, inventories, uniforms and other rental items in service and accounts payable. As of February 29 our balance sheet remains strong. Our leverage was 1.7 times debt to EBITDA. We've an untapped credit facility of $1 billion, no debt maturities in the next 12 months and no material debt maturities in the next two years. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] And first we have Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital. Manav Patnaik : Good evening, gentlemen. Just, may be in light of all the stuff going on, perhaps you could help us with a little bit more detail in terms of where your exposures lie; whether that's restaurants, lodging, and so forth, just we at least know magnitude of what percentage of revenues are really at risk versus those that could go like 50-50 or whatever it is. I was hoping you could help us with a little bit more color there. Mike Hansen : Sure Manav. We're -- as I mentioned a bit earlier, we\u2019re really at the peak of uncertainty. We're -- as of a week ago, we didn't really see much impact to our revenue, and so we're going about trying to get a better understanding of that as we go through this weekend and into the future, but let me remind you, we have a very diverse customer base about 30% of our revenues from industrial, 70% from service providing -- the service providing businesses that include healthcare, retail, distribution centers, food service, hospitality, and all of these are being affected in different ways. If you think about healthcare for example, they really need us now. They need our scrubs, they need our microfiber wipes, they need our cleaning chemicals, they need our fire protection. If think about restaurants, some are closed, some are open to only carry out, and we're learning as we visit them this week what are their needs. They may still need some chef works, some hygiene products, first aid, and safety, but it's going to take a little bit of time to understand what those needs are. Office environments, they're looking to stay clean more than ever; and so we're seeing some nice movement there in terms of our first aid and safety, our personal protective equipment like gloves, and then you think about hotels, casinos, arenas they are doing very much business right now, and so we are in the midst of better understanding the collective impact to the business Manav, and gosh we're so early in that process, but it's really hard to break it down because in addition to the details that I just provided and keeping in mind if you think about three digit NAICS [ph] codes, we don't have revenue of greater than 10% in any of those three digit NAICS codes. But also keep in mind, as I talked about revenue per vertical, it's quite different from geography to geography today. So, if you think about some of those different businesses that are on the coasts, they may be impacted more severely than those same kind of businesses in the same verticals in the middle of the country, and so this is -- it's going to take a little bit of time for us to really get clarity on the collective impact to the business, and we're just not there yet. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have a question from Andrew Wittmann with RW Baird. Andrew Wittmann : Great. Thanks. A question that we've gotten a lot this week is how customer closures work and how they affect you and what the contract says when such things happen. I know there's probably different ways to treat different categories of customers; small customers, large customers, maybe even by end market, but for those customers that are shutting down, we know are shutting down, how does that get treated by Cintas and what is the impact to your financials? Mike Hansen : That a -- it's a great question Andy, and as I said, we're still working on gaining clarity there, but it's going to be all over the board, right. This is not a normal environment; and in a normal environment, we may have a business shut down for a week and we still may be charging the rental of garments and other products. That means holiday manufacturing shutdowns are a good example of that, semester breaks at school is a good example of that. What we're talking about right now is quite different, and so we have to understand from our customers how long do they think they will be closed and many of them right now don't know. But how long do you think they're going to be closed, and what are the needs of the business today versus maybe where they were a couple weeks ago, and so it's going to be all over the board Andy from small businesses to large businesses and different kinds of verticals in different geographies, and as I said we're working through that to gain clarity. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan Securities. Andrew Steinerman : Hi Mike. Let me give it a try. So, my sense, I\u2019ve been on this for over a decade looking at Cintas and the group, and my sense is that the uniform rental business really is kind of cyclical on a delay, like when you look at your fiscal 2008, it was actually up. It wasn't until 2009 and 2010 fiscals, you did have kind of moderate declines about 5% organic per year for those two years. So, my question really is, do you think that the impact that you\u2019ve experienced now will be more immediate or do you think it's good to be a delay like I described last recession. Mike Hansen : Yeah Andrew, this is not, this is not a normal recession or even like the great recession, and so I think there's going to be -- there is going to be a more immediate impact simply because we have -- we have so many businesses that have been ordered to close, right. We've got -- 40 states have closed their schools. I think another over 20 states have closed their restaurants. That's unprecedented, and it's not like our customers are going out of business over time or even had the chance to reduce their workforce. They are kind of closing, many of them on orders of municipalities. And so, there's going to be a little -- there going to be certainly a more immediate impact. What is that impact? Look, one of the reasons that we did not provide guidance is it's really hard to tell. We've never been through a pandemic, and in this pandemic we're seeing things that we really haven't seen in the 90 years of Cintas of running the business, and so we're -- we need a little bit of time for clarity. As I said, we haven't seen much of an impact as of a week ago, but there is going to be an impact coming, and that's why -- that's why we did not provide guidance because it's just too hard to tell right now. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Seth Weber : I guess just following up on that line of questioning, I think in 2010 your decrement margins were sort of mid-30%. I guess Mike just trying to read what you're saying it seems like the impact could be rather shock. So from a detrimental margin framework, should we think about levels above kind of where you were in the last time that organic growth was down that kind of what you're messaging, thanks. Mike Hansen : Sure. So if think about the fixed versus variable and how can we -- how will we manage the business right through this disruption and right now there is a fair amount of uncertainty as I've mentioned a number of times and we need a little bit more clarity and the clarity and as it relates to this is really around what's the -- what's the depth of this what's the breath of this, how long will this last, what's the severity and duration? If we start to believe that for example the severity is pretty high but we don't expect the duration to last very long, then we may not be as aggressive because we don't want to harm the long-term opportunities and the performance of the business as we move into the next fiscal year. As we go into this, if we feel like the duration is going to be longer then we may take different steps to pull down some of those variable expenses and so we're going to need a little bit of time to understand what our best expectations are for severity and duration and we'll manage accordingly to that. I can tell you as we sit here today we are generally and we have been for a long time in a mode of growing the business and adding routes and adding laundry capacity and as we sit here today, I would we have not or at least we've slowed CapEx for example to only those things that are essential. And so in other words we're not looking to add routes right now that will reduce CapEx. We're not looking to expand capacity and our wash alleys, add extra -- open new processing facilities, that's going to reduce CapEx. Along those lines that means we likely won't be hiring people to staff those new routes, to staff the adding capacity and so those are -- there are certainly things that we can do today to say we expect to get into a period where the growth isn\u2019t going to be what it was in the first three quarters and so we can pull back on that a little bit and that certainly is going to help the cash flow, but as it relates to then being more aggressive, we are -- we're here for the long term and if we feel like this is a short duration disruption we'll likely treat that a little bit differently than a longer-term duration. Operator : Thank you, Sir. Our next question will come from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Oil prices have contracted sharply in recent weeks, what are your expectations for your industrial and manufacturing verticals and what factors could potentially cause Cintas to perform differently during this energy downturn compared to the prior 2014 to 2016 downturn? Mike Hansen : Well I think George if we were looking at this only in the lands of the oil and gas vertical then I'd say a couple things. One, it's a smaller piece of our business than it was at the beginning of that last downturn and so that will not have as big of an impact on us as it did last time and the lower gas prices will certainly help us today. And so if we're just looking at the lens of that particular or maybe a few verticals, I think we fair really well during that and we did several years ago as well, but this is broader, this is certainly broader than just that one lens and so it's going to be really hard to tell exactly how do we think we performed in that one vertical compared to what's going on in the rest of the United States. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Gary Bisbee : Hey. Good afternoon. In the earlier question about cost actions you referenced variable versus fixed but actually didn\u2019t give us the mix of the two. Can you take a shot at that and may be just at a high level if you do decide that this could be longer duration what are the kind of actions you would take? Is it just headcount or are there other actions you would take to reduce cost, thank you. Mike Hansen : Well so Gary if you think about our business there are many variable costs in the business. The question is are they variable to the point where we can turn them off immediately and do we want to turn them off immediately, that's the biggest question there we're dealing with and it's really I think you're responsible as me to give you a percentage of just total variable costs because we have to manage the business and we're managing it for the long-term and so I'm not -- I don't want to throw out some variable number that where you think we will cut to the bone our business. So let me give you some examples though. When you think about the material cost of the business, we've got a lot of cost of disposable products like paper soaps. We have direct sale like our catalog business those are highly variable and if we're not selling them, we don't have those costs. We also have the gas, water and energy, the gas for our trucks, the water energy for running the facilities. There certainly is a variable component of that, but there's also a bit of a fixed and it just depends on how much of that capacity we may decide or not to pull back on. Then if you think about the laundry capacity there are a lot of different pieces that go into that including labor and then when you think about our route capacity we got the cost of our drivers and so there are a lot of variable costs. Our goal is to make sure that our business remains strong for the long term and so if we start to see a longer duration then there are certainly some things that we will do like pullback even a little harder on capital expenditures and other growth pieces of what we do. We may do some things through attrition and we'll have to make sure we understand the capacity utilization and knowing that we want to manage through that. If you go back to '09 and '10, we did close facilities but that was a little bit -- that was a little bit different than that. It was a longer period of a recession. This is potentially deep, but we just don't know the duration and we do not want to impact the business for the long term until we really have to. Operator : Thank you, Sir. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Hamzah Mazari : Mike, if you could just provide just a little more detail on your contract structure and what I mean by that is if a customer goes bankrupt clearly you see that right away, if it's a closure but how quickly do your contracts adjust to permanent headcount changes. Just any sense as to how defensive your portfolio is but specifically what's the lead lag to headcount changes that may be permanent. I realize absences don't impact your business. Mike Hansen : Our contracts are generally five-year contracts and they provide for a steady stream of revenue and generally there is some minimum level of revenue that we require but Hamzah we're in a little bit of a different time today and so there's going to be a customer by customer conversation about what makes sense and that's going to take a little bit of time to get through. This is again this is not a normal kind of ramping down a trending down of the business. This is kind of an abrupt closure of a lot of different customers but let's remember something else about our business. As I mentioned a little bit earlier, there are a number of -- there are many businesses that really need our products and services and I don't want that to be lost. There been a couple municipalities in areas within the country particularly on the coasts and we have been identified as an essential provider and so even though other businesses may be shutting down, we are operating because our customers need us and we're going to over the course of the next few weeks, we're going to understand the collective impact but let's keep in mind that while some of our customers are going to be impacted negatively, there are others that really need us, we're seeing an increase in what they need and we're going to do everything we can to take care of them. So it's a mix and we're going -- it's going to take a little bit of time to understand that and give some clarity. Operator : Thank you, Sir. Our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Tim Mulrooney : I understand the forearm is very different Mike, but if you go back to the last recession and I can't remember if you broke this out or not, but how did customer retention look through that period. I'm trying to figure out how much of that mid-single digit organic decline in '09 and '10 was due to a deterioration in retention rates versus new customer sales that we're pricing for example? Mike Hansen : The retention was not negatively impacted that much. It was more about customers reducing their headcount. We certainly did have more customers than normal periods do lot of business and so that contributed to a little bit of a higher loss business number, but generally speaking our retention was really good. And I think our attention outside of possible businesses that actually have to go out of business, I think our retention is going to be very good here. It's going to just -- there's going to be some period of disruption that we have to work ourselves through. I think we have to be careful about comparing this to a prior recession. This is a pandemic that's quite different and the destruction is going to be a little bit more abrupt and immediate. The question is how long will it last and boy if we can get through this as a country in the next 60-90 days, we look forward to getting back to normal operations, but we have to see what that looks like first. Operator : Next we have a question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicolaus Investments. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Can you talk about how many of your contacts let's say percentage wise like first safety are those primarily consumption-based contracts or are they contracts that are kind of a recurring revenue, you charges for about per month. Can you go into that a little bit more because first aid and safety has been a very good growth portion of the business, just wondering how those contracts work? Mike Hansen : Generally those are based on -- there are some recurring revenue streams. I would tell you the bulk of that is consumption-based and the business is performing very, very well right now as you can imagine with the need for sanitizing personal protective equipment. That's a business that is performing very well it has for the whole year and we're getting a lot of customer requests for more ways to help. When you think about the needs of many businesses today, the cleanliness and the safety aspects have really risen and we've got a lot of products and services that can help in those areas and those have been asked for quite a bit over the course of the last couple weeks and I expect that those things will perform well. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Can you give us a sense of not only the client mix but what was the revenue trends the last week or so just to get a sense of how much the business came off and then just is there any way to think about it geographically because it sounds like California, New York, Washington maybe that's been a little bit weaker than the interior, but just any thoughts on trends the last week or so and is there any way to kind just bring that out, within a little more context geographically? Mike Hansen : Unfortunately Kevin through the last week we didn't see much disruption to the revenue. In our direct sale -- uniform direct sale business we did start to see the incoming orders start to come down and so that was -- that was probably the early signs, but through last week not a lot of impact. There have been certainly some impact on the coasts and so for example all of our customers in New Rochelle they're hard to get to as you can imagine with the National Guard patrolling the streets there. That's been difficult. There are others that have been difficult on the West Coast as well, but collectively it wasn't that big of an impact. I expect that we will start to see some impact as we go through the rest of this week and certainly then in next week and that's when we're going to start to be able to get a little clarity on what's the initial response of our customers and what might there need to be as we move as we move through. And like I said there are going to be some customers where there needs have really increased. There are going to be others who have closed and we're going to be talking about a different -- there's a different conversation there. We need to get through all those conversations though. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer & Co. Scott Schneeberger : I guess you\u2019ve alluded to CapEx a few times, just looking at it year to date, you're trending I think your guidance at the midpoint this year was the same as what you did last year but your trending about $17 million below for my numbers. So I just care it would be delve into CapEx a little bit more and I think you had said you had already taking some action with regard to what you\u2019ve been seeing over the last weeks or months. So just kind of delve in a little bit more on what you would be thinking about on a go forward basis as well thanks. Mike Hansen : Sure when I mentioned that we've made some decisions to reduce CapEx that's a very, very recent type of conversation. We are going to look, we are when we think about CapEx, we love to grow the business and we are -- we have been expanding the routes as necessary and expanding capacity, but we've also keep in mind we've gotten some capacity through the G&K deal and we've gotten some efficiency through projects within the facilities and our routes -- the revenue per route has been growing and so we've become a little bit more efficient and so we've been pretty efficient and I would say prudent in CapEx throughout the year. But having said that going forward we've been at let's call it a $50 million $65 million quarterly clip and certainly that's going come down probably by half. Now I don't have a very -- I don't have a scientific measurement but it's going to come down quite a bit as we think about the fourth quarter. Beyond the fourth quarter it's going to get back to our expectation for the severity and duration of this. Operator : Our last question in the queue comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : Thank you to save the best for the last. I am going to take the road less travel then ask a question about the quarter. Can you talk about the organic growth deceleration within the uniform rental space? It sounds like it wasn't related to coronavirus since you hadn't really seen an impact from that yet. So I guess just what were that main drivers of the deceleration within rental? Thank you. Mike Hansen : We've talked a little bit over the last two quarters about the choppiness that we've seen in industrials and we certainly saw that pick up a little bit in our third quarter. Now whether that has to do with China in the early parts of the quarter, not sure or the uncertainty around this, that's really hard to put our finger on, but we certainly did see some choppiness in that side of the business and contributed to a little bit of a deceleration there. Pricing was a bit more aggressive in the quarter. We talked a little bit about that in our second quarter and that remained here in the third quarter and the holidays I mentioned this in the second quarter call back in December, the holidays are tough what you've got two holidays on a Wednesday, generally speaking our sales people have a really hard time of setting appointments and so you if you think about a two-week period of time where you've got many customers because it's on a Wednesday taking the whole week off or in and out, it's really hard to set appointments. And so we did see some impact to our sales rep productivity. Paul mentioned in fire and also in rental and that was a bit of a contributor as well. So collectively those things we're what we saw in the third quarter. Let's set aside the pandemic, the business has been operating at a very healthy pace and we really like the execution of it and while the disruption is coming, we think we're poised pretty well to manage through that and get back on to our business once we get through this. Operator : Thank you, Sir. That concludes the question-and-answer session for today's call and I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Hansen for closing remarks. Mike Hansen : Thank you and before ending the call, we would like to leave you with a couple final comments. For someone to say again that our thoughts remain with those impacted by the COVID-19 coronavirus as our country works to get through this difficult situation as quickly as possible. But secondly, our business has performed very well over the course of the last 10 years with strong revenue, income and EPS growth. In fact we've grown our sales and profit in 48 of the last 50 years and although we're entering a period of disruption, we and all Cintas partners remain excited about the future opportunities of our business and look forward to getting back to business as usual. In the meantime we are well-positioned to enter this period of disruption with a strong cash flow, a very solid balance sheet and an uncapped $1 billion credit facility. So we feel good about our ability to manage through this and come out the other side with a very strong business. So thank you again for joining us tonight. We'll issue our fourth quarter financial results in July and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference and you may now disconnect. Please enjoy the rest of your day.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. J. Hansen: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today is Scott Farmer, Cintas' Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Todd Schneider, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. We will discuss our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2020. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer your questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which would cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.  I'll now turn the call over to Scott Farmer. Scott Farmer : Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. As you know, this continues to be a challenging time for all of us, and we can't thank enough our employees, who we call partners, for doing all that they can to keep our customers' places of business clean, safe and ready for the workday.  On May 13, we provided an update on how Cintas' business has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and how we were managing the business. COVID-19 continues to be a significant disruption to our economy and to business. Our priorities are unchanged. They include keeping our employees healthy and safe and remaining committed to serving our customers in any way possible. I believe we're succeeding at both.  Our employee partners have been consistent and diligent in their care of our customers, providing essential products and services to health care facilities, pharmaceutical companies, grocery store chains, food processing plants and many others. We've provided health care customers with clean scrubs and microfiber towels and mats. We've provided tens of thousands of customers with disinfectant and sanitizer spray services. And we've provided tremendous amounts of personal protective equipment, including face masks, face shields and other items to our customers to keep their employees safe.  Our supply chain has worked feverishly to satisfy this demand. The demand for items like hand sanitizers and N95 respirators has increased tenfold in this pandemic. Our existing suppliers around the world have been key to us meeting this demand, and we thank them for their support. In addition, our scale enabled us to establish additional relationships with dozens of vendors to secure these scarce products. We continue to work to aid existing customers with the products and services that they desperately need, and our ability to access these products that others can't has enabled us to win new customers. We continue to communicate with our customers who remain idled who are -- and are considered on hold, and our focus is on being there to help them when they reopen.  Before turning the call back to Mike, I want to conclude by stating that I'm thankful for the tremendous dedication of our employee partners. I'm proud of their ability to adapt and persevere in the midst of unprecedented adversity. In addition, I'm as excited as ever about our principal objective of exceeding our customers' expectations to maximize the long-term value of Cintas for our shareholders and working partners. Our value proposition of getting businesses Ready for the Workday by providing essential, unparalleled image, safety, cleanliness and compliance arguably has never resonated more than it does today. This pandemic will not soon be forgotten, and its impact on society is likely transformative.  We believe a new trend of greater focus on health, readiness and outsourcing of noncore activities is underway. More health care scrubs are being professionally laundered and managed, so fewer are worn in public. Businesses, including universities and retail establishments, are requiring huge quantities of sanitizer and related services. Most businesses are providing larger budgets to align with proper cleaning protocols and supply chains of these key items are moving to the U.S. to reduce dependence on other nations. We believe Cintas is well positioned to benefit from this new normal.  Now I'll turn the call back over to Mike. J. Hansen: Thanks, Scott. Our fiscal '20 fourth quarter revenue was $1.62 billion, a decrease of 9.7% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations were $1.38, a decrease of 34.8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Free cash flow for this year's fourth quarter was the highest it had been all year at $316 million.  Organic revenue adjusted for acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays, declined 8.4% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Organic revenue for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment declined 9.6%. Organic revenue for First Aid and Safety Services operating segment increased 21.9%.  Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 of $708 million decreased 14.1%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 43.7% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 45.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 and 28.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19. Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 of $207 million decreased 34%. Operating margin was 12.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 17.5% in fiscal '19.  Our fiscal fourth quarter contained one less workday than the prior year fourth quarter. One less workday in a quarter has an impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of a workday basis.  Fourth quarter of fiscal '20 operating income was affected by many items caused by COVID-19, including additional reserves on accounts receivable and inventory, severance and asset impairment expenses and lower incentive compensation expense. Excluding these items, the operating margin was 15.5%. All of these items were recorded in selling and administrative expense. The additional inventory reserves account for slow-moving inventory, mostly in our Uniform Direct Sales business, where customers in some of the most severely-impacted industries such as airlines and hotels exist.  Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 was 20.4% compared to 21.7% last year. The tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 was $145 million, and reported earnings per diluted share were $1.35.  At the onset of the pandemic, we drew on our credit facility in the amount of $200 million. This was for defensive purposes. We have a great cash flow business. And as the quarter progressed, cash generation exceeded our expectations. Cash generated was used not only to repay the $200 million borrowed against the revolver but also to pay off a $200 million term loan. We ended the quarter carrying no variable debt. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6x debt to EBITDA. Our balance sheet is strong. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion and no material debt maturities in the next 12 months. Free cash flow for the year exceeded $1 billion and increased 34.1% over the prior fiscal year. We remain steadfast in our commitment to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. We purchased $393 million of Cintas stock in fiscal '20 under our buyback authorizations, including $200 million in early March before the COVID-19 pandemic. The amount remaining under our buyback authorization is $1.1 billion.  Looking ahead to fiscal '21, please note that there will be one more workday than in fiscal '20. One more workday will benefit fiscal '21 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. One more workday also benefits operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '21 operating margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20 due to one more day of revenue. By quarter, in comparison to fiscal '20, the fiscal '21 first quarter will contain one more workday. The second quarter will contain the same number of workdays. The third quarter will contain one less work day, and the fourth quarter will contain one more workday. Please keep the quarterly day differences in mind when modeling our fiscal '21 results.  Before turning the call over to Todd Schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses, I want to comment on fiscal '21 financial guidance. Due to the recent increases in the number of people contracting COVID-19 and the actions governments are taking again in response, uncertainty remains about the pace of the economic recovery. Therefore, we are not providing annual guidance at this time. However, since we are more than halfway through our quarter, we are willing to provide our first quarter financial expectations, and they are as follows : revenue in the range of $1.675 billion to $1.7 billion; Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment organic revenue decline of 8% to 9%; First Aid and Safety Services segment organic revenue increase approaching 10%; earnings per diluted share of $2 to $2.20; and that implies a total operating margin in the range of 16.5% to 18% at the revenue midpoint.  As Scott was quoted in today's earnings release, despite the uncertainty, we are confident in our ability to manage the short-term and maintain focus on our long-term objectives. Todd will now make some comments about the performance of each of our businesses. Todd? Todd Schneider : Thank you, Mike. The recent operating environment has certainly been challenging. As Scott mentioned, our focus has been on the safety of our partners and fulfilling the needs of our customers. At the onset of the pandemic, our leadership team attacked the crisis like a major acquisition or investment. Leaders from all areas of the company met daily to gather information, strategize and execute. Daunting challenges were overcome, and many were viewed as opportunities, facilitated by our strong corporate culture, which is rooted in positivity, competitive urgency and concern for employees, customers and other key stakeholders. The results have included a safe and healthy workforce and a rise in Net Promoter Scores from our customers. Our approach was to be highly flexible and take a long-term view of our relationship with our customers. Fortunately, we were deemed an essential service in all markets we operate in. However, many of our customers were closed. And even for those who were open, the impact on the financials of their business was substantial. For those customers who are open or ready to reopen, we were able to provide products and services that were critical to providing confidence to their employees and customers that they were in a safe environment. Products like soap, hand sanitizer, masks and disinfectant spray services.  I'll now turn to the fourth quarter financial performance of our businesses. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health care scrubs, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies, hand sanitizers and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.27 billion, a decrease of 11%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes and the difference in the number of workdays, organic revenue declined 9.6%.  Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter, compared to 46.0% in last year's fourth quarter. We had one less workday in our fourth quarter, which had a negative impact of about 40 basis points in the current quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year's fourth quarter were more than offset by amortization expense on uniforms, dust mats, towels and other items rented to customers. Amortization expense was 300 basis points higher this fourth quarter compared to last. This noncash expense is a significant headwind in the short term but will improve in ensuing quarters because purchases of new items were reduced and more existing items will become fully amortized.  As Mike stated, selling and administrative expenses were negatively affected by many items caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus. Excluding the impact of the applicable aforementioned items, Uniform Rental and Facility Services' operating margin was 16.1% compared to 18.5% in the prior year period, a decremental margin of 37%.  Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $196.3 million. Organic revenue for the segment increased 21.9%. Revenue from servicing the first aid cabinets decreased due to the business closures from staying-in-place orders. However, our business of providing personal protective equipment surged, overcoming the revenue declines of cabinet servicing. Sales, service, supply chain, finance and others work quickly to provide current customers with masks, respirators, sanitizer and other critical items needed. In addition, the division secured new business through our ability to source scarce resources quickly. The result was a 40.8% organic revenue growth rate in May. Businesses are echoing our mantra of, \"There is nothing more important than the health and safety of our employees and customers.\" The first aid segment gross margin was 46.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 47.7% in last year's fourth quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year's fourth quarter were more than offset by cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold was 840 basis points higher this fourth quarter compared to last and is attributable to the increased proportion of revenue from personal protective equipment. Excluding the impact of the applicable previously mentioned items triggered by the COVID-19 coronavirus, the First Aid and Safety Services operating margin was 18.2% compared to 15.4% in the prior year period, an incremental margin of 32%. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses are reported in the All Other category. Fire Protection Services include the performance of testing, inspection and maintenance of fire protection equipment, including extinguishers, alarms, sprinklers and emergency lights. Uniform Direct Sales business includes the provision of custom-tailored apparel. All Other revenue was $152 million, a decrease of 24.5%. Organic revenue declined 24.5%. The fire business organic revenue declined 12.4% due to the inability to access many businesses because of closures from stay-at-home orders. The Uniform Direct Sales business organic revenue declined 39.5%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality and gaming customers largely falls within this segment. These industries have been amongst the hardest hit by the pandemic.  That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question today, and that is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan Securities. Andrew Steinerman : I was hoping you could give a comment about just small and medium-sized businesses in total. Obviously, it's an important part of your client base. Do you feel like the small businesses that haven't opened yet still aren't in a position to open? And if not, do you feel like when would we know more? Scott Farmer : Well, Andrew, this is Scott. It's -- I'd say we have ongoing conversations with our customers that are on hold, and I would say that the majority of them intend to reopen. A lot of it depends on how long this lasts and that sort of thing, but we feel pretty good about it so far. And the indications that we get from them are that they do intend to reopen, so -- but it's going to be -- it's so cloudy right now looking out into the future. I don't know that any of them could -- on a state-by-state basis, maybe they could give us some sort of an indication of their timing. But in total, it's very difficult for us to be able to do that for you. Andrew Steinerman : Okay. And so far, they felt like the federal support for small businesses during this juncture has been sufficient? Scott Farmer : There's -- I'm sure there are lots of opinions on that. But yes, I think so. I think that we'll find out if more support is coming based on what we understand is going on in Washington right now, both for businesses as well as for individuals. And I think that supporting the individual would, in effect, also be supporting the businesses because they'd have the money to spend to do so. But we'll find out more here in the coming weeks as that gets resolved in D.C. Operator : And we'll move on to our next question or comment, and that is from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Seth Weber : I hope you're doing well. Scott, in your prepared remarks, I heard several times you talked about the health care vertical and the opportunity there. Can you just talk about whether you are actually seeing real-time conversions here from hospitals that are switching to more outsourced scrub rental? And just sort of the conversations that you're having there in that vertical, in particular, and I know you've sort of targeted a more specific sales effort there and just traction on how that's going. Scott Farmer : Sure. Yes. We have, for the last few years, had health care as a vertical that we've spent a lot of time and effort trying to cultivate. I think that you've all probably seen news reports of health care workers after work, going to grocery stores or some other place and being harassed by other customers because the customers were afraid that their clothing was contaminated. And hospitals realize that, health care workers realize that, traditionally, particularly in the nursing end of health care, the nurses have bought their own scrubs and taking them home and wash them themselves. There has been a conversion to professional laundering of those scrubs so that health care workers don't take them home, don't wear them out of the hospital and so forth. And that would be something that we could handle for them.  We have seen customers who have used our services relative to scrub rental in portions of the hospital expand that into other areas of the hospital. And I think that, that is the beginning of a movement we will see more and more of as I look to the future. Todd Schneider : Seth, this is Todd. Just to expand upon that. As Scott mentioned, you see the videos, the folks in grocery stores where people are upset because of what is on their garments. And what we're seeing is employers are worried about what people come in contact with from the point they leave their home to the point they arrive at the hospital, and employees are worried about what they're taking home as well, whom they might come in contact with on the way home and what goes into their home laundry. So this professional cleaning, hygienically, clean laundry is really important. And we've had a number of customers, many of which are names you would recognize, that are very interested in broadening these programs to help their employees and their businesses. Scott Farmer : And I would just add one more thing. That is not just the big hospital chains. It's also doctors' offices, dentists, health care workers in general. And so we'll -- it's early stage, but we like the momentum that we're seeing there and think that it has an opportunity as we look out in the future for an area of really good growth. Seth Weber : Okay. That's super helpful. And Mike, if I could just get a follow up in. Just the delta for the quarter, it came in a little bit better than I think your kind of mid-quarter or late quarter update. Is there anything that you would call out that drove just the relatively better end of the quarter, onetime -- big onetime sales or anything? Or is it just sort of trends just got a little bit better than you expected towards the end of May? J. Hansen: Yes. As Todd talked a little bit about it in his remarks, that first aid really finished with a strong May of 40% growth. And as much as anything, it was that kind of performance that led us beyond the guidance that we gave in mid-May. Operator : And we'll move on to our next question, and that is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Keen Fai Tong : Can you provide an update on your uniform rentals' capacity plans, especially with the evolving pace of business reopenings? And what your capacity plans might have in terms of an impact on decremental margins over the next several quarters? Scott Farmer : Sure, George. The question is what is our capacity plan? Is that -- just make sure I'm answering it the right way. Keen Fai Tong : Yes. Historically or recently, you've indicated that you may -- you intend to maintain the majority of your capacity in anticipation of businesses reopening. And now with the pace of business reopenings, obviously in flux with COVID infections spiking in certain places, what are your latest thoughts on maintaining that capacity? Or will you plan to trim capacity given what we're seeing? Scott Farmer : Well, let me sort of give this a broader view of how we've managed this up to this point. Todd mentioned in his remarks that early on, we had daily meetings with our leadership team, and that's HR and IT and my direct reports, the presidents of the divisions, global supply chain. And we covered a number of different things in that -- in those meetings. It started with the safety of our people and how do we get them the right personal protective gear and how do we make sure that people who are arriving at work aren't infected? And how do we take temperature? Where do we get the thermometer? All that sort of thing. And then from there, moving into the customers.  But part of it also included a review of business and capacity. And generally speaking, we're happy with where we are from a capacity standpoint, although we continue to review it. There is a -- there is -- we announced that we're shutting down an operation in Minnesota. And that was one that we had been looking at for some time. It was an acquired operation. It was an older facility with older equipment and inefficient layout. And in that market, we have capacity to move the volume into other facilities that are more efficient, more modern. And so we announced that we're going to do that. We consistently review the operations and our capacity on a market-to-market basis, and we'll continue to do that looking forward. Todd, you got anything you want to add? Todd Schneider : Yes, George. Great question. We're looking at this in the long term. We're excited about the -- where our position -- our business is positioned. We think that the demands for our products and services moving forward are going to be healthy. When we look at it, we think of image, safety, cleanliness, or all things that businesses are very, very interested in. So we're -- we constantly are evaluating our capacity model.  As you know, capacity is really a local subject. It rolls up to a corporate subject. But we look at it locally, and we're constantly evaluating it, but we're thinking long term. And we like our position and we like where the demand, we believe, is going to be coming for our products and services. Keen Fai Tong : Got it. Very helpful. And then as a follow-up, can you provide some additional detail on how revenue trends evolved moving through the quarter? And if your fiscal 1Q outlook assumes stable July run rates in August or if it assumes an improvement off of July levels. Scott Farmer : So George, we've seen -- obviously, since the May call, we've seen some nice improvement in the revenue run rates in which we were in the May time frame down in the mid- to high teens. We've seen that reduce to the mid- to high single digits. And we're expecting still a slight improvement but [Audio Gap] and a lot of improvement as we move forward. So we're seeing a little bit of improvement, but not much from this point. Operator : We'll move on to our next question, and that is from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Hamzah Mazari : My question is on how do you -- the sustainability of first aid organic growth and also, hygiene. If you could touch on what you saw there in terms of growth? And whether you think that's sustainable for the balance of the year? Obviously, demand is still there, but do you think the market's well supplied, whereby that organic run rate drops off? Just any thoughts as to how you're thinking about those 2 specific areas. Todd Schneider : Great. Thank you for the question. This is Todd. As Mike and Scott mentioned, trying to forecast out past Q1 is very challenging. And the reason being is the spike in cases recently have changed it. So it seems like every couple 2, 3 weeks is more like 2 or 3 months in the past. So -- but we do see, as cases rise, there's demand for PPE is still strong. As people -- as we believe that drops off with hopefully remedies, vaccine, eventually, people will be back to work, and they'll be consuming more product out of our first aid cabinets. So it's tough to forecast out past Q1. But nevertheless, we think we're in a really good spot. Scott Farmer : Hamzah, this is Scott. I would add that I think as a general statement, one of the reasons we saw the big spike of these sales in May is because there was really a rush by just about every business out there to find personal protective gear, hand sanitizer, the things that they need to keep their workplace open and clean. And if they could find somebody who had it, they were buying months' worth of supply because they were afraid that if they came back out into the market again to buy it, it may not be there. So it was almost, to me, like what we would see when we would sell a large direct sale customer. We get a big first upfront order as everybody gets their close, and then it drops off to a more typical run rate after that.  I think that we're going to continue to see the demand for the masks and the hand sanitizers and that sort of thing, but there was a big upfront purchase, a race to make sure that you had enough of it. And it will settle back into an ongoing demand, certainly not at that 40% run rate.  Now relative to the hygiene services, my read on that is that, that's a long-term change in the marketplace. I said in the May call that I think that what this pandemic has done to workplace cleanliness and sanitation is similar to what 9/11 did to public building security. We have customers right now that have come to us and said, \"Look, I have 7,000 branches. I need hand sanitizer stations at all of them. I need somebody to come by on a regular basis and make sure that they're full. That's for my employees and my customers.\" We've seen large universities, big 10, Pac-10 universities come to us and have thousands of these hand sanitizer stations put up in their buildings across their campuses. They want us to do this because not only do we have the sanitizer and the station available but the service to come by on a regular basis and make sure that they have the supply that they need as opposed to worrying about buying a whole bunch of sort of retail pump bottles, trying to put them in places and having those disappear because people grab them and walk away with them.  So I think that our service and our service model in these areas is playing a big role in the marketplace today with our existing customers and our ability to sign new customers. And once they start talking to us about things like hand sanitizers and surface sanitizers, spray services and things like that, we start talking about their restroom services. And if they have people that need uniforms, we start talking about uniforms and entrance mats and the rest of the things that go along with that. So from a hygiene standpoint, I'm confident that this trend is going to continue. Todd Schneider : One last item on that subject is we -- what Scott mentioned. There's such a need for these products because they need to restore for these folks, whether it's a bank branch or a hotel, whatever, university, they need to restore confidence in their employees, their customers, their students, their guests, whatever it is, and these products are critical to restore their confidence.  Or -- and then what it's also doing for us is it is allowing -- because it's such an important subject to these folks, it's allowing for us to get an audience at very high levels within organizations. Higher than, in many cases, has ever been before in organizations, and then we're able to speak to the comprehensiveness of what we can provide. And it resonates [Audio Gap] Hamzah Mazari : That's very helpful color. Just a follow-up question. I'll turn it over. Just on the SAP system. Could you maybe talk about what kind of data that gives you now relative to what you didn't have before? I realize it's COVID-19 and demand environment is different, so you may see benefits of cross-selling come in later from the SAP. But just for investors, just to get a sense of what do you have today that gives you sort of a full view of the customer that you didn't have before that can maybe help you longer term once you come out of COVID or during COVID even? Todd Schneider : Hamzah, thanks again for the questions. This is Todd. SAP is doing a lot of things for us. We are -- we now have one view of our customer. Not completely, right, because we have it in our first aid business and our rental business, but a significant portion of our business. It's helping the speed at which we're able to retrieve data, which is helping us to make decisions in more real-time basis than in the past. And it's also helping with some other items that we're doing from a technology standpoint, give the customer a view of their spend with us, helps them be able to manage their business with us. And obviously, there's some other benefits that we're seeing from an ability to reuse products, get a good view of our stock rooms, of our supply chain, et cetera. So it's been very beneficial. Operator : And we'll move on to our next question, and that is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Manav Patnaik : My first question is just around the supply chain that you guys have. You talked earlier in the call about your scale aligned to get additional relationship with vendors and so forth. Just broadly, like has there been any other disruptions? Or would you say net-net, it's been pretty smooth? Scott Farmer : Manav, this is Scott. I would say that -- and this -- first of all, I think this goes back to the morning meetings that we were having. We were getting real-time feedback on what was going on in the field, what our customers were looking for, what they needed and that sort of thing. And we got to jump on it early by having the entire group together to say, we need to get out and source face masks, hand sanitizers, all of the hygiene products because there's a huge demand coming. And our supply chain folks did a fantastic job going out and reacting to that.  And I said on the last call that I think our supply chain has become a competitive advantage for us. We are in good and getting better stock position on most of these items, and we have competitors that are still struggling to source it at all. And so I think that our supply chain has done a great job. So I would say disruption, no, I don't think there's been any disruption. There were some a little bit at the beginning when we first started trying to find some of these things, but they've done a great job in meeting the demand. Manav Patnaik : Got it. And just a broader question around managing the cost base. I know there's obviously a lot of uncertainty. You talked about the administrative facility that you were looking at a while back. I think there's another one in the Milwaukee area you closed. But just wondering how you're thinking about what further cost actions you need to take now? Or is it just a wait and see all these things get worse, do you cut more or rationalize more? Todd Schneider : Manav, this is Todd. So from a cost standpoint, we know -- we believe we've been through the worst of it. We believe we've shown a great ability to manage through that process. And we're continuing to adjust our cost structure in all facets as we move through this pandemic. We believe it's short term. We believe the long term of our business is -- looks very, very positive. But we've successfully managed through what we believe is the worst of it, and we're going to manage through this process as we move forward, no matter what is thrown at us. Operator : And we will move on to our next question, and that is from Andrew Wittmann with RW Baird. Andrew J. Wittmann: I guess I wanted to check in a little bit on the competitive environment. Every recession is different. But historically, if volumes wane, sometimes there can be increased price competition. So I was just wondering, Scott or Todd, if you could comment on what you're seeing from the competition, if it's too soon to say or if there have been any changes in the marketplace? What those changes are, if any, and how you're reacting to them? Scott Farmer : Andrew, this is Scott. I'll make some comments, and then if Todd has anything he wants to add, I'll turn it over to him. But overall, I think that it's difficult to say so far what's happening from a pricing standpoint as a result of COVID-19. We'll get anecdotal evidence on a market-by-market basis that things are competitive, if somebody is doing some crazy things. But we always seem to get that. I would tell you that one of the things that we have seen and seen evidence of is that we do have some competitors out there who are struggling to service their customers.  I don't know whether that is supply chain issues that they can't get the product, whether it is that they have service issues or something's happened in their service force or what it is. But we have seen some signs of that. I wouldn't call that a major trend. But I think it is one of the things that is unique about this pandemic is that for one reason or another, some of these businesses are just having a hard time operating as they ordinarily would. Any other feedback? Todd Schneider : Yes. I think the other item is, Scott mentioned that our supply chain organization has done an incredible job in helping position us to service our customers properly, and I completely agree with that. But one of the decisions we made very early on in one of the meetings that Scott has -- we've referenced earlier is that even if we're in a position where we are so unique because we have product that others don't, we're going to take a very long-term approach on how we handle that with the customers. We are going to be extremely fair on pricing and approach it as though it's not a onetime sale. It's going to be a long-term customer.  And so that's how we approached it. Generally speaking, the environment -- the competitive market is, I would say, Andrew, I haven't seen any real change to the landscape besides some one-off items of lack of supply, those types of things where we've garnered an opportunity to -- that we've levered. Andrew J. Wittmann: That makes sense. I guess the corollary to that question is, is the stress that's out there in the marketplace, do you think, potentially going to shake loose opportunities for acquisitions in this environment as well? Scott Farmer : Well, it's tough to say where and when somebody might decide to sell their business. But you can see a scenario around this in just about any industry where it could cause people to make decisions to sell their business. We obviously are in a position where we could afford to make acquisitions, and that would be something that we would be looking forward to do if the opportunities present themselves. Operator : And we'll move on to our next question, and that is from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Gary Bisbee : So I wanted to ask a question about the costs. The first quarter outlook implies sequentially improved revenue but sequentially lower costs. So can you just give us a sense sort of how much costs you've taken out or how we should think about how that will annualize through the P&L when you'll actually see all of that? And the last piece of that, should we think that some of the cost takeout you've done is structural? Or is it more really temporary that we should think most of it comes back at some point in the future when revenue begins to trend back to the historical levels? Scott Farmer : Well, it's a little bit of all of the above there. We have eliminated all discretionary spending. Business travel is down. As a matter of fact, we're not allowing people to travel right now. So those kind of costs are down. Some training meetings where people ordinarily would be flying and traveling to go to training and staying in hotels isn't happening. Those are happening in Zoom meetings and team meetings and things like that. We have made some changes to rightsize the organization from a labor standpoint. Those can and will go up as volume comes back and that sort of thing. We have -- we've eliminated -- we announced that we're going to close one of our operations. That's more of a permanent or at least a longer-term type of thing.  But we do all of the above, and we'll continue to look at the changing nature of this and we can head in either direction. We can manage the cost as we grow into it. Or if it -- I think in May, there were 44 states that had stay-in-place orders, general business restrictions that shut down businesses in those states. If it goes back to that, well, we know what that world looks like. We've been there. We're off mid- to high teens in revenue, and we know what we need to do to rightsize, to go back to that point. I don't think that direction is going to happen, but we're ready to go in either direction to manage the costs the way they need to be managed in order to continue to help the P&L statement and make a good margin. Gary Bisbee : And I know you're not giving guidance beyond this quarter, but would a reasonable way to think about that moving forward be that you think you could manage the cost structure relatively in line with change in revenue? So in other words, if Q1 margin actually looks quite strong year-over-year given the revenue headwinds, that you could keep that kind of pacing? Or are there some step function costs that could come back in at some point when you do see revenue much stronger? J. Hansen: Yes, Gary, what we saw in the fourth quarter was such a precipitous drop in revenue that's it's hard to react, but we did. And you're seeing some of those benefits of the reaction in the first quarter. Now as we move, Scott talked a little bit about the -- we will adapt to the revenue and the environment as we move forward. But there are going to be some things like discretionary spending and travel that certainly will come back. We still have a hiring freeze on today. And as we get more clarity on the future, we will start to then think quite a bit more about adding to the capacity for growth like we normally would in a kind of normal environment. And we'll get back to that kind of thing.  But certainly, we're seeing some benefits in the first quarter of the moves and the decisions we made. And we're going to adapt as we move forward into the second quarter and the rest of the year, but it's a little bit unclear still what that environment looks like. And so we'll make -- we'll continue to make decisions rapidly so that we can do our best to adjust to the levels of revenue and the levels of capacity that are necessary. Gary Bisbee : If I could sneak one more in. Historically, in Q4, you've given the rentals mix by products. Is that something you have at your fingertips and be willing to share this year? J. Hansen: Sure. We -- our uniform rental business was 50% of the rental segment; dust was 18%; hygiene was 14%; shop towels, 4%; linen products, 10%; catalog, 4%. Not a lot of change from the last year in any of those categories. Operator : And we'll move on to our next question, and that is from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Timothy Mulrooney : Scott, you mentioned at the beginning of this call about their -- about being there for your customers when they reopen. What percentage of your customer base would you say has reopened at this point? And also, can you help us understand what those conversations look like? When the customer reopens, is it a slower ramp? Is there any sort of contract renegotiation? Or do you just kind of -- do you just pick up where you left off? Scott Farmer : Well, first of all, we're dealing with a business owner or manager who did not make the decision themselves necessarily to shut their business down. And so the conversation is around what are your plans? When do you hope to reopen? Help us understand what you think will happen in your business and how we can help you. Have you furloughed or let go any of your people? We have large customers who have turned to us to help them develop cleaning protocol for their business. We can share some of that with you. Prior to the pandemic, you were just using these services. We have some other services that might help you to make sure that your workplace is clean and sanitized with various products and services that we can provide. Would you like us to help you get set up with those type of things? But really, it's to help them get to a point where they reopen. We look at it and say the lifetime value of these customers is really important to us. And we're not here today to talk about the contract and that sort of thing. We're here today to help you get reopened. As your business starts to come back, we can get into all the rest of the details of that sort of thing. And I would tell you, Tim, that we use the Net Promoter Score system to evaluate our customer satisfaction, if you will, with our services. And we have seen a dramatic increase in Net Promoter Scores as we have moved through this pandemic because of the way that we've helped them, because of the advice and the tools and the services that we can have. I would tell you that we're getting letters from presidents and CEOs of pretty big companies because of what we've done to help them, but it has improved our relationship with -- as a general statement, across the board with our customers as we help them through this. And I'm proud of the way that our frontline people have been handling this, and we look forward to helping more and more of these customers come back online. Todd Schneider : Tim, this is Todd. We have such a diverse customer base, both by industry and geographically. So that conversation with the customer really depends upon what's going on in their business, where they are geographically. Some of them, they're opening back up and they had no revenue before they opened back up. Some had virtually all their revenue. And that conversation, as you can imagine, varies dramatically depending upon what they were experiencing in their business.  But generally speaking, most are being -- were impacted, even those who remained open. And we work with them. We work with the customers, and we said, they said, \"Hey, we can only afford so much.\" We said, \"Well, let's take the -- let's adjust your spend with us down in this area, but we can help you with these areas that are so critical to restoring confidence in your employees and your customers that they're operating in a safe environment.\" And that helped them and helped us to -- is helping us to bring more value to our customers. Timothy Mulrooney : That's all great color. A strong increase in Net Promoter Scores is an encouraging sign. And good luck next quarter. Operator : And we'll move on to our next question, and that is from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : In the past, you've talked about how about 60% of your growth comes from converting no programmers. And I'm just curious, in this environment, are you seeing a change in that mix? Are you seeing higher growth from existing customers? Or are you seeing maybe new customer signing up for the hygiene products? Just trying to think about how that growth dynamic has been changing in this COVID period. Scott Farmer : Toni, this is Scott. It's -- we're a couple of few months into this, so it might be difficult for us to give you any hard data on that. But clearly, for certain products, both existing customers who haven't used it from us in the past and prospects need it. And so we're working very hard on both sides of that to provide that to businesses. I think that there are businesses that may not have typically been users of our services that are looking to us now and saying there's an opportunity. There's a company out there that can provide this stuff to us and provide it on a regular basis, where we don't have to worry about it anymore. We should call them and talk to them.  So I think there's some opportunity in the no programmer market for us to broaden our opportunity to continue to grow. J. Hansen: And Todd, maybe talk a little bit about sales rep productivity that we're seeing right now. Todd Schneider : Yes. Thank you, Mike. Toni, what -- our sales and productivity, I am so impressed by their creativity and by their tenacity. They are -- productivity is doing really, really well and it's in part because of our culture, because of our partners. And because we have products and services that people want and need to, again, help restore confidence in their employees and their customers, clients, et cetera. So as you can imagine, our sales partners aren't exactly out physically in front of folks nearly as much as they were, but they're busy. They're busy at all-time levels and doing it via calls, Teams calls, Zoom, phone calls, you name it. And we're very encouraged by that. Toni Kaplan : That's great. And I was hoping you could give an update on the final amount that you've spent on SAP this year and what you expect to spend next year? And just an update on any benefits that you're seeing so far from the implementation. J. Hansen: The spend this year, Toni, has generally been in that recurring -- the implementation costs and the training and consulting costs. And we've talked over the last few years about $12 million annually of that for the last several years. And that amount will drop off as we've completed that rental rollout.  From the perspective of the benefits, Todd talked a little bit about the information that's available, and sometimes, that's hard to quantify, especially in the short term. But we're seeing the sales rep productivity be good. We're seeing some good information on the one view of the customer, the online portal information. And so those are going to drive some benefits, but it's going to take a little bit of time to see that, and it's pretty difficult at this point to quantify what that might be. Toni Kaplan : That's great. And the $12 million goes to $0 next year? J. Hansen: Yes. I mean it does drop off. In the -- Toni, in the midst of this changing environment, dealing with the pandemic, it's going to be a little bit hard to say that's going to be x basis points for the year, but that $12 million does drop off as that implementation has been completed. Operator : We'll take our next question and that is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicholas. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Mike, is there any way you could help investors quantify the opportunity for the scrubs rentals in Cintas? Like what's opportunity just in general into health care with that? And how much of your sales are any way into health care? And is there like a way to think about the pull through? Other words, we're hearing a lot of it. This is a great opportunity. And conceptually, we can understand that. We're trying to figure out like when you put pen to paper, what could this mean for you guys? J. Hansen: Well, Shlomo, Scott talked about the health care opportunity a little bit earlier, and we love the opportunity. We even -- we loved it before the pandemic. But as we sit here today, we like it even more. It's about 7% of our total revenue, and we think that's got a real opportunity to grow. It's hard to put pen to paper and give you a specific number, especially when we are in the midst of this pandemic environment.  But we love the opportunity. And when we get things like scrub rental products into hospitals, we are there almost every day, and that invites more and more opportunities, whether it's in microfiber or first aid or other types of Cintas opportunities. We love being there with our customer and talking to them about the challenges that they face. And so it generally can lead to more enterprise-type sales at those big hospitals. And as we move forward, Scott talked a little bit about we're seeing this cleanliness idea move to the smaller health care facilities as well, and that creates opportunity in the scrubs, in the microfiber and other places. So we really do like the opportunity as we move forward, but it's pretty difficult to put a specific number on it right now. Shlomo Rosenbaum : All right. I appreciate that. And then maybe just one for Scott. I know you talked enthusiastically about the opportunity you had with your supply chain and that it's a real differentiator and your ability to access very high levels of the organizations now.  You've had a very long, successful career in this industry. How would you rank this opportunity now versus what you've seen in different points in time of your career in terms of being able to have access and then potentially be able to capitalize on that in terms of driving your business forward in terms of additional sales because of that access at a higher level of the organization? Scott Farmer : Well, Shlomo, you're right. I've been around for a while, sometimes longer than I can believe. I've been at this -- I started in 1981 right out of college. So it's -- I've seen a lot happen in this business and in this industry. I have always looked at this business with the thought that we have great opportunities ahead of us. And so it's tough for me to say that this is better than others. But there are people that, when I first started going to the trade association meetings, didn't think the entire industry of the rental industry could do the kind of revenue that our company alone is doing now. And so we've been able to grow through all of this.  I look out into the future and I say I'm very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us relative to our current position, the things that we have to offer businesses across so many different segments that they really, really need right now. I think we're in a very good position. And we -- obviously, all of us need to resolve this pandemic. And I read some great news this morning that one of the reports I saw, I think it was in the Wall Street Journal, said Pfizer thinks that they might have approval sometime in October for a rollout of a vaccine in January. And whether it's January or February or whenever it is, if you think about it, this is July, end of July. And so we're closing in on this race for a vaccine. And hopefully, when that happens, we'll get back to a new normal where all the businesses can open back up. And I think when that happens, we can really maximize our opportunities. Operator : We'll take our next question, and that is from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : I happen to focus on the travel and hospitality end markets, airlines, cruise, hotel, gaming, which look like they may have a bit of a tail of some trouble. Just curious, your conversations, I know you're not providing guidance beyond the current quarter.  How should we think, based on conversations you've had with those customers, is the good and the bad of consideration looking out over the coming fiscal year? Just anecdotally, what you think are some puts and takes we should keep in mind? Todd Schneider : Scott, this is Todd. Certainly, those folks, those customers in the hospitality business, the travel industry, let's say, have been -- they're facing some serious headwinds. But our conversations with them is that they're looking at it long term. They're certainly worried about business travel coming back. Leisure travel, they think, will bounce back faster. But we're working with them at very high levels. And in the case of a few, specifically, we work on teams to help them with their cleaning protocols to help them establish how to provide a safe environment for their guests. And it really all gets back to confidence that the guests have to feel confident that they can travel and be safe. And we are an important portion of that.  Now certainly, they're not buying certain products such as garments from us at the rates that we would like, and frankly, that they would like. But we do have other products and services that they need to help restore confidence. And that is an important investment that they have to make prior to even their revenues coming back at large -- to a large degree. So they see that much value in it that they're investing in it in the near term and hoping that the guest traffic comes back. And as you know, that is really a subject that depends upon where they are geographically, what type of properties, et cetera. But we're all in hopes that, as Scott mentioned, that we get to remedies and certainly a vaccine very quickly. That way, the ultimate confidence can be restored. Scott Farmer : That is all primarily direct sales business for us as well so -- at least on the uniform side. So the vast majority of that is reflected in our direct sale results. And they obviously have been hit probably the hardest of all of the segments out there. And maybe that means that it's going to take them longer to recover. But at some point, looking out into the future, I think we all agree that we're going to travel somewhere. We're going to stay some place when we get there. And as Todd says, their ability to show us as customers of theirs that we're safe, that we are on a clean airplane and staying in a clean hotel and eating at a clean restaurant, the sooner all that happens and they can gain our confidence, the more likely it is that we're all going to begin to take advantage of what they have to offer. But those industries are going to be around. They're not going to go away. This may change it in some ways, but they will be out there, and they will recover. Scott Schneeberger : Great. And then just a quick follow-up on -- well, given subject, Scott, you had touched on earlier on the cash availability and consideration of M&A in this environment. Just want a bigger picture of your thoughts on capital allocation for the company because you do have flexibility. Are you going to sit for a while and watch and wait and see what happens and be conservative? Or might we see the -- becoming offensive with M&A, you've addressed, but also other uses of cash, maybe return of capital and thoughts there? Scott Farmer : Well, yes, I think that our priorities have been, and I think looking forward, will continue to be that we would like to make acquisitions. We'd like to make investments that would help us continue to grow the business. Mergers and acquisitions would be a great way for us to do that. We also have a long track record of increasing our dividend. And those decisions will be made at a future point about what next year's or what our next dividend would be, but that is an important priority for us.  And obviously, as you have seen in the past, even into the spring, stock buybacks have played a role when opportunities present themselves. I would say that sort of attitude approach is likely to continue as we look out in the future. When and how much and things like that depend on what opportunities present themselves, but our priorities really haven't changed. If we had an opportunity to make an acquisition now, we would certainly want to look at that and take advantage of that opportunity. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. So I'll turn the conference back over to Mike Hansen for any closing remarks. J. Hansen: Well, thank you for joining us this morning, and we look forward to talking with you again after our first quarter, and that will likely be in mid- to late September. So thank you, and have a great rest of your day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. All participants may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Paul Adler, Cintas Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Paul Adler : Thanks, April, and good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today is Scott Farmer, Cintas Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Todd Schneider, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2021. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Scott Farmer. Scott Farmer : Thank you, Paul. This continues to be a challenging time for our employees, who we call partners, are doing all they can do to keep our customers\u2019 places of business clean, safe and ready for the workday. Our employee partners have remained diligent in their care of our customers providing essential products and services. And they remain diligent in their care of each other, and we can't thank them enough for their truly impressive achievements. Before we get into the financial results, I'd like to provide you with some examples of our interactions with our customers in the first quarter of our fiscal year, so you will have a better understanding of our business. A hospital system in Michigan provided isolation gowns to their staff and laundered them in the hospital. These garments are fluid resistant protective clothing worn by doctors and nurses. The hospital had difficulty staffing the laundry and suffered quality issues. The hospital system, a no programmer as we call it, decided to outsource the procurement and laundering to Cintas so they could concentrate on patient care. Another no programmer, a dental alliance with 55 locations in three states, signed with us for scrubs in a rental program for 550 wearers. Due to their satisfaction with the service, they're in discussions with us to add facility services products and first aid supplies. In California, one university system with many campuses signed a multi-year agreement for hand sanitizer service. In addition, our first aid business is providing them with $0.5 million of hard to find gloves. To another university system in California, our first aid division is providing over a million facemasks. A restaurant chain that has been a customer since 2007 had been struggling in the first few months of the pandemic. In talking with the customer, we listened and were empathetic and adjusted service frequencies and inventories in partnership with them. They were so pleased with the way that we treated them that they renewed our service agreement and added hand sanitizer stand service to every one of the restaurants. A casino customer in Ohio recently reopened after being dormant due to COVID-19 restrictions. In order to conduct business in the new environment, casino added rental mask services and additional items to increase cleaning protocols including dusk mats and microfiber mops, and towels. And a city government in Texas was a no programmer until they came to us for a hand sanitizer program for all of their government buildings. They were so happy with the execution that we gained their trust to provide some of their Personal Protective Equipment needs as well. They were impressed with our ability to deliver hundreds of thousands of masks within days. These examples are just a handful of the many and were offered to highlight the following; our opportunity to convert no programmers, the do-it yourselfers remains robust; scrubs and isolation gowns are indicative of a broad uniform rental opportunity. Our approach is being flexible with customers in the short term reach, long-term benefits. Our Net Promoter Scores, which we use to measure customer satisfaction has never been higher. Earning the trust of the customer enables us to penetrate -- enables further penetration and cross selling, and our supply chain and service network, our competitive advantages, enabling us to increase service to existing customers and add new customers by procuring and providing items in short supply. Our value proposition of getting businesses ready for the workday by providing essential unparalleled image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance has never resonated more than it does today. A new trend of greater focus on health, readiness, and outsourcing of non-core activities is under way. We are well positioned for this new normal. I'll turn the call over to Mike now for commentary on the financial results. Mike? Mike Hansen : Thanks, Scott and good morning. Our fiscal 2021 first quarter revenue was $1.75 billion, a decrease of 3.6% from last year's first quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS were $2.78, an increase of 19.8% from last year's first quarter. Free cash flow, which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for this year's first quarter, was $281.4 million, an increase of 32.6%. Organic revenue adjusted for acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and differences in the number of workdays, declined 5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Organic revenue for the uniform rental and facility services operating segment declined 5.4%. Organic revenue for the first aid and safety services\u2019 operating segment increased 17.1%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '21 of $826.2 million decreased 2.7%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue 47.3% for the first quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 46.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 27.3% in the first quarter and 30% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. Fiscal \u201821 first quarter results benefited from lower expenses as a percentage of revenue in many areas, including discretionary spending. Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal '21 of $349.7 million increased 14.2%. Operating margin was 20% in the first quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 16.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. Our fiscal first quarter contained one more workday than the prior year first quarter. One more workday in a quarter has an impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense, and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of on a workday basis. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '21 was 7.8% compared to 10.1% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal '21 was $300 million, an increase of 19.6%. Earnings per diluted share were $2.78, an increase of 19.8% from last year's first quarter. In addition to the solid financial performance, we continue to generate strong cash flow. First quarter free cash flow was $281.4 million, an increase of 32.6% compared to last year. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6 times debt to EBITDA. Our balance sheet is strong. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. For financial modeling purposes, please note that there will be one more workday in our fiscal '21 than in our fiscal '20. One more day will benefit fiscal '21 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. One more workday also benefits operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '21 operating income margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20 due to one more day of revenue. In fiscal '20 each quarter contained 65 workdays. In fiscal '21, workdays by quarter are 66 in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3, and 66 in Q4. Please keep these differences in mind when modeling results on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Before turning the call over to Todd Schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses, I want to comment on fiscal '21 financial guidance. Due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, uncertainty remains about the pace of economic recovery. Therefore, we are not providing annual guidance at this time. However, we would like to provide our second quarter financial expectations. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.725 billion to $1.75 billion and EPS to be in the range of $2 to $2.20. Please note the following regarding second quarter financial expectations. Our second quarter contains the same number of workdays as last year's second quarter, but one less than our first quarter. We expect operating margin as a percent of revenue to be in the range of 17.5% to 19%. And we expect our second quarter effective tax rate to be about 22% compared to 20.1% in last year's second quarter. I'll now turn it over to Todd. Todd Schneider : Thank you, Mike. Mike. Before I review the business results, I'd like to build off with Scott's comments. While the environment remains challenging and uncertain, we did experienced a continued improvement in results through the quarter. The majority of our existing customers have reopening and our employee partners work diligently in partnership with these businesses to get them ready for the work day. Despite reopening, many existing customers are not yet operating at the same level of business before the COVID-19 pandemic started, because of the virus\u2019s impact on health and the economy. In keeping with the Cintas culture, our employee partners are working with urgency to offset these headwinds. Significant opportunities for new revenues exists because of the need of businesses to instill confidence in their employees, customers, students, patients, et cetera, that they will remain healthy and safe. Additionally, businesses are outsourcing tasks that are not their core competency, so they can successfully navigate these challenging times. The value we provide businesses has never been more evident. In fact, we've been given a seat at the table in discussions with state and local officials, hospital administrations, COVID-19 procurement task forces and hospitality cleanliness counsels. There is greater demand for services and products we already provide such as health [Technical difficulty] in other areas, demand is so attractive that we are providing new services and products made possible by our supply chain, distribution network, sales force and cash flow. These include rental healthcare isolation gowns, hand sanitizer stand dispenser service and sanitizing spray service. With that, I'll turn now to the first quarter financial performance of our business. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, healthcare scrubs, masks and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs for our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.39 billion, a decrease of 4.1%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes and the difference in the number of workdays, the organic revenue declined 5.4%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 48.7% for the first quarter compared to 47.2% in last year's first quarter. Prior inventory amortization expense of 80 basis points was more than offset by the benefit of lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue, the additional workday and lower energy expenses. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $204.5 million. The organic growth rate for the segment was 17.1%. The first aid segment gross margin was 40.2% in the first quarter compared to 49% in last year's first quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year first quarter were more than offset by higher cost of goods sold from the increased proportion of revenue from personal protective equipment, such as masks and gloves. Our Fire Protection Services and uniform direct sale businesses are reported in the all other categories. Our fire business historically grows each year at a strong pace. Uniform direct sale business growth rates are generally low-single-digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Uniform direct sale, however, is a key business for us and as customers are offered significant opportunities to cross sell and provide products and services from our other business units. All other revenue was $147.7 million, a decrease of 20%. Organic revenue declined 22.2%. The fire business organic revenue declined 5.3% due to the inability to access some businesses because of closures. The uniform direct sale business organic revenue declined 47.3%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality and gaming customers largely falls within this segment. These industries continue to be among the hardest hit by the pandemic. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And we'll first hear from Seth Weber of RBC Capital Markets. Seth Weber : I had a couple questions on the first aid safety business. I guess, maybe Mike, can you just talk to how -- do you feel like you're still seeing large one-time sales in that category or do you feel like that this is, that the growth rate there has been a reset to a higher level kind of on a sustainable basis? And then on a follow up question, can you just talk, give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing on the supply chain on the cost side? I think Todd called out some higher COGS for some PPE. Is that -- do you think just a temporary issue or will that -- is that sort of the new normal just on the cost side? Thank you. Scott Farmer : Seth, this is Scott. I'll take the first part of that. I\u2019ll let Todd take the second part of that. On first aid and safety, I think the way that is probably the best way for you all to look at it is that a lot of the initial upfront large sales of PPE through the first aid business are similar to what happens in the direct sales business. When we sell a big new customer, there's a large upfront sale of these goods and then it will -- that customer's revenue will drop to a maintenance level. And so, we are seeing that in the first quarter we did have a lot of large upfront sales to customers in the first aid and safety business that are now moving into that maintenance level. That doesn't mean that there aren\u2019t other customers out there that we can find and identify, but I think that there was a big rush of that in our first quarter as pandemic hit, and so I would say we're probably closer in the second quarter to move it more into the maintenance mode on those type of things. I would say that probably means that we may not drill in the high-teens in the first aid and safety, but we will continue to see very good growth in first aid and safety. Todd Schneider : We kind of end up in a large first order and then there is some maintenance mode there, but we're really focused on taking care of our customers. They are -- and there\u2019s great demand for some of these products out there, gloves, masks, hand sanitizers et cetera. So, we're blessed to be in a good position in the inventory and be able to take care of them, but we are encouraged still that we're selling a lot of first aid cabinets that's going well, and we think things will moderate in growth, probably we're also anxious to see the COGS to moderate back to closer to where it was before. Seth Weber : And have you seen any pickup in the cabinet business Todd? I know last quarter you talked about is sort of [Technical Difficulty]\u2026 Todd Schneider : Seth, you sound a bit muffled. Can you start that question over please? Seth Weber : I was just wondering if you\u2019ve seen a pickup in the cabinet business. I know last quarter you talked about that you're having challenges getting into facilities and things like that. Has that -- has the cabinet side of the business picked up as well? Todd Schneider : Yeah, our new cabinet sales are going quite well, but we have a heck of a lot of customers that are still on the sidelines. They're close. So that's certainly affecting what is being procured through our cabinets, and we're anxious for those businesses to get back up and running. But long-term, while we pivoted helping our customers and long-term we're quite bullish on the direction of the organization. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Next we'll hear from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. You talked about healthy growth for scrubs and isolation gowns in the healthcare vertical, both among existing customers and in the no programmer market. At this point, what percentage of revenue is being generated by healthcare customers and how quickly is this vertical growing? Scott Farmer : Hi, George. This is Scott. When we talk about revenue in the healthcare segment, keep in mind that we're talking about all the products and services that we would provide to the healthcare segment that is both fire service, first aid service, some direct sales business, and obviously some rental -- uniform rental and FS business. It represents about 7% of our total revenue now. We're excited about what we see in that segment. Healthcare represents about 17% of GDP. And so we think we continue to have a big opportunity in healthcare. The scrub rental business and these isolation gowns -- from your perspective if you just simply refer to those as the scrub business, I think you'd be safe. These isolation gowns are things typically worn over the top of the scrub, dealing with particular patients to protect the nurse or doctor from bodily fluids and things like that that. No need to get into a whole separate category on that. But we're excited on what we see there. The COVID has brought a realization to healthcare providers that taking -- wearing scrubs to work and then wearing them home may not be the right approach, and they're looking for ways to outsource managing those programs for them and we really like the position that we're in. I would say that healthcare has a great opportunity to be the first segment that we service to grow to over 10% of our total revenue. And so, we remain very optimistic about this segment. George Tong : And as revenues begin to recover over the near to intermediate term, can you provide some perspective on what you expect for incremental margin flow through, particularly as operating leverage begins to kick in and you start to see utilization and capacity rates recover? Mike Hansen : Yeah. I think, George, from an incremental margin perspective, we talked a lot about in the past, we like incremental operating margins to be in the 20% to 30% range. Clearly, we've exceeded that in this first quarter. But that's the -- longer term, that still is the range that we like to see, because it really keeps us in a cadence where we are growing in the way that we want to grow and we are managing the number of sales people that we need and the number of routes that we need, the amount of capacity that we need, and when we are growing the way we want to grow, we actually like that 20% to 30% range and expect that that will continue as we get out of this really disruptive and bumpy period. Operator : Hamzah Mazari of Jefferies. Hamzah Mazari : My first question is maybe for Scott. I know you've touched on some examples of net new business sort of in your prepared remarks. But maybe if you could just talk about how the sales cycle today compares to pre-COVID in converting some of these customers? I assume healthcare has accelerated given to some of your comments, maybe even food service. But maybe if you could just talk about how that cycle defers today versus pre-COVID. It seems like it's accelerated. I think you touched on outsourcing potentially accelerating coming out of this period? Scott Farmer : Yeah, happy to provide a little color there and Todd may want to chime in as we go through this. But the pre-COVID we had decision makers that had time to review things, try to get multiple competitive looks and things like that when we're out in the marketplace. I think that the urgency of trying to find certain products and services certainly shortened that sales cycle, decisions were made more quickly. It's not to say that they weren't trying to find competitive bids. But in many cases, it was hard for competitors to come up with the products and services they needed to fulfill a customer's order. I'm proud to say that we did a really good job of making sure that we were in front of that and had inventory. And so we've been reasonably successful in being able to help these companies out. As we look at sales productivity amongst our sales force we have been through the entire COVID period, selling at very impressive productivity rates, very high historically. We'd like to see that happen. We think it's a good sign for the foreseeable future for the company. And so you combine that sales productivity with decision makers that are in the market, trying to make reasonably quick decisions and we think we can do very well in that regard. Todd, I don\u2019t know you have anything to add? Todd Schneider : Yeah. It's good question. It really varies dramatically based upon whom you're calling on, the products you're selling. Our sales organization is highly urgent anyway and highly adaptable. And I've been really impressed by how they\u2019ve been able to overcome any obstacles that were -- it seems like came in their way. But we have products and services that people really need to -- I'll say instill confidence in their employees, in their guests, in their customers, how you want to describe their students, their patients. When you have those available, it does shorten the sales cycle, because there is some times where we walk in and they say, my goodness, you have that, let's go. And so, again, there's so many different sales processes going on at any one time. It\u2019s tough to say, make a sweeping statement. But just generally speaking, yeah, it set it up because of the urgency of making sure people are taken care of. And we are again blessed to be in a good spot with it products and services, and that creates confidence in our people, in our customers and showing in the productivity. Hamzah Mazari : Great. And then just my follow-up question is just on the hygiene business. Could you maybe talk about the outlook there but particularly, what is your value proposition in hygiene versus some larger competitors that maybe moved into that market first? I know your product looks nicer than Ecolab from the outside -- but hand sanitizers and such. But maybe just give us a sense of the value prop you have in that business, because it seems like a newer business for you even pre-COVID obviously is accelerated today. Todd Schneider : Hamzah, I'll start then Scott can feel free to jump in. And we appreciate your comment on our products. We invest a heck of a lot into our R&D to make sure that we have really attractive functional products, a lot of investment in it. And we have been in the hygiene business for I'll call it decades, right? It\u2019s just we spoke in our last call about how 9/11, September 11, 2001 had a dynamic impact on security and we believe that this pandemic is going to have a similar effect on hygiene in our world, and that has been something that's been positive for our business. So our customers love the fact that we have availability. We have attractive products. We have a great inventory distribution system. Very fair approach to how we handle things. And we have a great suite of products and services that are right there on the truck. They can deal with one organization that can handle all their needs we\u2019re able to -- because the vast majority of our routes service our customers weekly and allow for us to be able to inspect what they have, where they are from an inventory standpoint and help provide some consultative services instead of just tell us when you need some more product. So that route infrastructure and obviously, distribution center system is a real strategic advantage for us moving forward. Scott Farmer : And I'd say it this way just to echo what Todd said. What we do that most of our competitors who have been in this space for some period of time don't do is that we're there every week so we make sure that they always have inventory and they never run out. Most of the time, a customer who's buying it from a supply house or a traditional competitor has to take it upon themselves to realize that they're running low on inventory, sometimes that happens when they're out of inventory then they have to go and place the order, they have to wait for the order to come to them. They're out of supply for maybe a few days and that sort of thing. And they don't have to worry about that when we're taking care of it for them. And restrooms are something that every single business has to deal with. And when we take care of that for them, it's one less detail that they have to worry about in the course of their business day and allows them to focus their time and attention on taking care of their customers. So I think that's the value proposition that we're offering in the hygiene business. Operator : Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Manav Patnaik : My first question is, clearly you guys are winning a lot of new mandates there. And in the past, you talked about how non-programmers, really kind of two thirds of the new sales. Is that tilt, is that still [persisting] more now, because as it's the COVID driven demand? And is it -- I assume competition get the same kind of list as well, or is there an element that you guys just winning some of that new share as well, if that\u2019s [high] at the table? Mike Hansen : So Manav, I think you're asking is there -- we talked about new business, about 60% of our new business coming from new programmers, and is that the case as we sit here in this disruptive period and are we seeing any differences in the way that our competitors are coming to market and competing. And I'll start, as Todd mentioned earlier, our new business continues to be very, very robust. And we're selling not just the same mix of product from six months ago but a little bit of a different mix as it relates to this hygiene messaging, which is resonating so well. And so that certainly can lead to new types of prospects that we may not have talked to in the past. And when we get our foot in the door good things can happen. When they start to see our service, we can continue to talk about other needs that they may have. And so we've seen some nice success in that during this -- even during the fourth quarter but more so in this first quarter. Todd Schneider : Frankly, that was part of the question of the sales cycle. The sales cycle is certainly a big setup just because we all saw more no programmers. There is no hurdle it hit over to sale something they can buy immediately and that can be a positive for us. As Mike mentioned, if we're selling into different -- a variety of different prospects and we're also, because of the urgency and the intensity of what we're -- what is important to these businesses, we're going to get at levels of decision makers that we weren't in the past quicker. So that again speak things up. When decision makers hear our value proposition it resonates. And so there is certainly don't -- pandemic has been absolutely horrible for the country, the world, it\u2019s been major for our customers. But if there is some shining light it's bringing more focus to the products and services that we have and the value that we provide and getting us an audience at high levels and quicker. Manav Patnaik : Okay, that makes sense. And in terms of at least the examples we\u2019ve provided, it sounds like there\u2019s lot of large institutions that are coming to you guys for the offerings, but maybe just on the flip side. Can you just talk about your kind of small business customers and adding just kind of in survival mode? Do you anticipate risk further down the road of getting on the lockdown that they can even survive? Just any color there would be appreciated. Scott Farmer : Obviously, that depends on geography, industry segment and that sort of thing. It's different in each one, because of various local governments or state governments that have put restrictions in place. I\u2019d say generally speaking the small customers that are open right now are weathering this -- as a general statement, pretty darn well. I think it says a lot about the American entrepreneurial spirit to see them, able to do the things that they're doing with the new rules in place, be they face masks and outdoor dining and such. But some of them -- many of them are not at full capacity yet because of various restrictions that have been put on them, or customers that may not be ready to come back out to frequent their businesses. So clearly, I think for the American economy, for the global economy, a vaccine is going to be very well received so that the rules can change and businesses can get back to operating under a sort of a new normal but a normal that allows them to operate in a more traditional fashion. Operator : Andy Wittmann with Baird. Andy Wittmann : I have a question and then a follow-up question. I mean clearly here in the quarter you saw quarter-over-quarter acceleration in the organic trends and talking about the rental segment, I guess, in particular. And I'm just curious if you could give a little bit more detail on your customers and look at the guidance for next quarter kind of suggest that revenues will be down 5% or 6% year-over-year and that's not too dissimilar from what you saw here in the quarter. So how has the month over month trends progressed in comparison to what the implied revenue outlook is? And just any color that you have in terms of your visibility in this and how you chose to select this range with all the uncertainties, conservative or other factors that are baked into the revenue guidance? Todd Schneider : Certainly, this has been an unusual environment right? There was 22 million jobs that were lost, it seemed like overnight almost and then jobs returned pretty quickly in the early, very early portion of the summer. And then as you've seen that the summer we're on things moderated a bit and jobs returning and so 11 million people that are -- 11 million jobs that have not been recovered. So that has certainly impacted our business. So we need more businesses to come back. We are still guiding towards sequential growth from Q1 to Q2. We do have one less workday in Q2 versus Q1. And we're encouraged by our new business efforts, the products and services that we're selling, the engagement of our customers of what we're providing. But it takes a while for all those new business efforts to recover over all the businesses that are still closed and all the jobs that are still on the sidelines. But we're very much looking forward to Q2, Q3, Q4 and we like the trend line to work that we're seeing. Mike Hansen : And maybe I'll offer a couple points. One is Scott talk a little earlier about the first aid and safety, large personal protective equipment sales there that kind of turned into maintenance a little bit. So keep that in mind. Another point I'll make is if you think about the first quarter revenue on the same workdays as Q2, you're talking about 1.720 billion. And so we do see some -- that guidance range especially at the top of it does look too nice sequential improvement. And keep in mind -- the last point I'll make is last year's second quarter was a pretty good quarter for us as well. And so when you put it all together echoing what Todd said, we remain excited about the performance and the momentum that we have, particularly in a bit of a challenging environment and one that still contains a fair amount of I'll say lack of clarity, let\u2019s say. And so we think this guidance range really points to continued nice momentum improvement. Andy Wittmann : Thanks, Mike for that, that's good perspective. I want to also kind of ask on the cost side here. Anytime you've got basically EBITDA up against declining revenue that's again, a very surprising and very good outcome for the company. We're already starting to see some questions from some of our customers asking if there was anything one-time, either positively or negatively. In other words, costs that maybe were furloughed or otherwise, things like that that were recognized in the quarter that need to creep back in here as the year progresses or other things, if you continue to do some level of restructuring, certainly that was a big factor in your fourth quarter. It sounded like you had it mostly contained in the fourth quarter, but maybe there was some carry over in the first quarter. But, Mike, I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about some of the puts and takes inside the margins and the implications about incremental margins over a hundred percents here on a go forward basis and what's unusual about the quarter, if anything. Mike Hansen : Sure. I'll start that. I wouldn't call out any specific one-time items. But as you think about this period of time that we're in, we entered the quarter with a fair amount of disruption and lack of clarity. And we entered it with a hiring freeze, a wage rate freeze and pretty tight control on discretionary spending. And as the quarter went on, revenue obviously came a bit higher than our guidance range and we've been pleased with that. And so we started to bring -- we started hire back revenue producing positions and that certainly will have an impact as we move forward. But in the first quarter in this period of just extreme disruption, we entered it with a lot of uncertainty and we exited with still some uncertainty, but better momentum than we certainly expected. I'll point to a couple of things though within the quarter. Energy was 30 basis points better than a year ago. So we certainly got a little bit of a help there. We talked a little bit about discretionary spending. If you think about travel that was down about 100 basis points. We are itching to get out to visit customers and our locations, and we'll start to do that slowly but some of that will get leveraged with better revenue momentum as well. And then the third thing I'll say is last year you might recall we had a pretty high medical expense in the first quarter. We kind of settled back into our normal range and that was a benefit of about 90 basis points. All-in-all though, Andy, it points to our ability to really control the costs and manage the business pretty well in a highly disruptive period of time. And it also shows that as we move out of this, we have some -- we will continue to invest in revenue producing positions and the growth routes, et cetera. Operator : Andrew Steinerman. Andrew Steinerman : Hi. It\u2019s Anderw. I just wanted to get a little more clarification about monthly trends. I definitely understand we're in uncertain times, and there's so many jobs to return to the workplace yet. I just wasn't sure if when you were talking about year-over-year organic revenue declines in rental. If you saw September, meaning what we've already experienced continue to narrow from August, so are declines now in September year-over-year versus August, or have we already seen kind of September declines sort of hover with August? So it's really -- is the uncertainty in like October, November, or have you already seen some hovering in September? Mike Hansen : Andrew, we saw some really nice momentum. And certainly, Todd, talked about the highly disruptive period at the beginning of the quarter. And so the job recovery, the economic recovery was pretty extreme in the early part of the summer and the business reopenings moderated as certainly as the summer went on. But our revenue performance improvement continued through the quarter, and we still believe that -- we're still looking to see sequential improvement. And so September, while moderated from let's say June and early July, is still moving in the right direction and trending in the way that we would want it. Operator : Next we'll here from Gary Bisbee at Bank of America. Gary Bisbee : I guess I'd love to go back to the margins a bit more. So you've obviously done a great job cutting costs and deferring some investments. And I heard you earlier, answer to the earlier question about what helped in this quarter? But can you give us any sense of how to think about the cadence of costs coming back? Do you envision ability to manage that pretty tightly with sequential improvement in revenue? Or are there some costs at some point that it could come back more quickly? And I guess as part of that, have you identified anything within your cost reduction efforts to date that you think could turn into more permanent or sustainable cost reductions for the business? Scott Farmer : Gary, this is Scott. First of all, as we look out into the second quarter and beyond, we are confident in our ability to control our costs. And we are still really managing labor at the very top of the organization so that people who are adding or want to add positions have to make sure that they're going through the proper channels to get approval to do that. Things that we need to do to invest in the business are going to come back on line, that may be trucks that have been and/or service reps that have been idled because of this disruption, because of the growth that we've seen through the first quarter, some of that is coming back online as a result of that that's driving some production. Labor to produce the goods. We're bringing some sales people back online that were temporarily on the sidelines. In the second quarter, we're back to advertising both national radio advertising and some TV advertising that you may have seen this past weekend. So these are the kind of costs that we think are necessary to continue to grow the business and to get our brand out there kind of customers and prospects. But we're very confident in our ability to manage these costs. Are there things that we look at to say maybe we don't need those, or as much of that or that might have a long-term impact? We're always looking for those kind of things and that is part of the culture that we have as a company. And when we find them, we pretty much jump on them and make sure that we can drive those cost out of the organization. I think that they\u2019re nothing major at this point that we saw in the first quarter but there will be some things that will change the way we operate and do the business moving forward. We're much more efficient right now out of necessity than we have been. And I think that that's always good for any organization to put themselves in a position where they look around and you realize what else can we do to get efficient. So I think we've done a really good job. And my expectation is that we'll continue to do so. That said, there are going to be some things that are coming back online in the second quarter that I think for the long-term -- intermediate and long-term benefit of the business and our ability to grow our necessary expenses, all of which are within the guidance. Todd Schneider : Gary, this is Todd. As Scott talked about growing is expensive, right? It\u2019s an investment. And I think we've shown the ability to manage those expenses on the way down, meaning as the economy kind of went off a clip. And we will manage them on the way up as well and hopefully, that continues. And I got to tell you it\u2019s a whole lot more fun to manage on the way up than there\u2019s on way down and our people feel that way. And when you go through these types of cataclysmic events, as Scott mentioned, it makes you look through different lens. You evaluate the organization different. And one of the interesting items is how we engage with our customers, do they want us there -- should we be there in person as much, whether it\u2019s a Teams call, or a Zoom call, or a FaceTime, whatever it is, business moves fast. And we're evaluating that, our customers are valuing that. But it does allow things to speed up. And will that have a long-term impact? It could. We shall see, I think, certainly, in the short and intermediate future that\u2019s what we see. Gary Bisbee : Great. Thanks. And then just to follow up, you talk a lot about sanitizer sales and the big opportunity there. Is it right that that all flows through the hygiene facilities business within rental? And if that is right, can you give us any sense sort of how well that's doing and maybe what the underlying rental revenue trend is today or how it's been trending, excluding that hygiene business. Just trying to get a sense if that's doing a lot worse and hygiene is just absolutely killing it today. Any color on that would be great. Thank you. Todd Schneider : So the sanitizer sales predominantly flows through rentals, certainly our first aid customers as well. We sell sanitizer whether it's in various forms. So you'll see it in both but predominantly in the rental organization just because of the scope of their organization and our customer base, et cetera. And sanitizer sell is going quite well. But you know what, it is leading to other sales as well. It gets us in the door and allows us to, as we mentioned earlier, it's getting us in front of prospects we've never been in front of before. It's getting in front of decision makers we weren't able to get to in the past. I think on our last call, we spoke about a really large banks that we had hardly done business with before and now they have sanitizer service at all their branches, which is significant. But it also -- now they\u2019re talking to us about first aid and they're talking to us about fire and other rental products. So those types of urgent needs allow for our people to get in and help explain to people what we do, how we do it, the value we provide and it opened some eyes and we're able to sell more. So it\u2019s really encouraging. Operator : Next question from Tim Mulrooney of William Blair. Tim Mulrooney : Two quick ones on the balance sheet here guys. First of all, you got a lot of cash piling up on the balance sheet here. Is this just a prudent to have extra liquidity given the macro uncertainty? And can you share what your capital allocation priorities are for this year? Scott Farmer : Yeah, first of all, there's a lot of uncertainty still out there. We like having some cash on the balance sheet in case anything comes up that is unforeseen and our balance sheet is strong anyway. But it certainly helps us have a more optimistic view of the future when we have that on the balance sheet. I think that normally in a normal environment with our ability to generate cash, we're looking for acquisitions, we're looking for what we can do relative to investing back into business, dividends, share buybacks and such to help improve our shareholders\u2019 overall return. And I would say that as things become a little more clear, as we get out into the future, we'll get back to our normal process. And then we've got a pretty good track record of how we manage those things for our shareholders and I would expect that we'll be back to that hopefully soon. Hopefully, we'll get a vaccine that will work at some point and get back to more normal environment. Tim Mulrooney : Does that include CapEx getting back to normal run rate? It was like $30 million in the quarter, that\u2019s I think less than half of what you did last year. Would you expect that to get back just as I\u2019m thinking about my models? Scott Farmer : Yeah, I'd say this. I don't know that you're going to see a lot of increase in CapEx in the second quarter. Most of the time CapEx is -- about 60% of that is for growth and 40% is for maintenance. We do have some capacity in markets with ability to put some more trucks on the road and within our production facilities. So I don't know that the growth CapEx is going to be necessary in the second quarter. We get out much beyond that. It's still a little cloudy out there for us to predict. But I can see that hopefully by the end of the year, we're back to a more than normal CapEx spend and that means that hopefully we'll be seeing a more normalized growth environment for us. Operator : Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : Just curious about kind of the pain point in markets that you have been doing as well. I think airlines, crude maybe oil and gas. Could you give us an idea just percent of revenue is being impacted that would not be in the fiscal second quarter guidance as anticipated to see improvement? And then I know there are different things in those end markets, so it\u2019s not that easy to do. But just to give us a feel of how much of the revenues are impacted that you don't see coming back in near-term? Thanks. Scott Farmer : Scott, most of those highly impacted segments are in our direct sale business, that would be the travel and hospitality related customer base, that would be hotels and airlines and crude ships and even gaming is in there. Those revenues are off significantly in the direct sale business. We think it\u2019s going to continue that way for the foreseeable future. I think that those are probably a longer lead time to see those to see if those come back as their customer base gets more and more comfortable with getting on an airplane, going to an airport or flying to a city, taking a taxi to a hotel and so forth. So I think that we're going to see those areas struggle for a while. That is all in our guidance and it\u2019s also in our results for the first quarter. I would say that the second quarter probably for those related industry segments will perform similarly to the way they did it the first quarter. There may be a few in there that do a little better than others. But I'd say it's probably, at this point, through the second quarter more of the same in those segments. Scott Schneeberger : And maybe just as a follow up broadly, I don\u2019t think you guys touched upon the ERP and what you're seeing now that that\u2019s mostly implemented. So just a quick update on that please. Thanks. Todd Schneider : Well, our ERP is, we roll it out across our first aid and our rental division over the past few years. And we're seeing some real nice advantages there, whether it affects our ability to get product to customer faster has been a nice impact. Our transparency into the data, the ability to look at the customer across business units has been advantageous, especially as we go-to-market in some of the key segments has been significant. So we're very happy to be done with the integration, right, that was -- these are never funding process. But we're also seeing some real nice advantages there. And I'd say one of the bigger ones is the ability to get speed of product to customers, because of various items internally that allows us to get the product to that. So that customers really value that, especially in an environment like this where you can deliver when you say you will or faster in an environment where a lot of companies are struggling to do that and that's a big advantage for us. Operator : Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley has our next question. Toni Kaplan : Just regarding the upcoming election, what are your thoughts on potential impacts on your business depending on the outcome? I was thinking of it as maybe under a Trump win? Seems like bringing back some manufacturing jobs into the U.S. could be good, but maybe higher tariffs could be a potential offset. Is that the right way to think about it? And how are you thinking about the puts and takes of a Biden win? Scott Farmer : Well, yeah. I mean, there's a big difference between the two candidates and their intentions. I would say that the U.S. economy, not just us but the U.S. economy, will be affected depending on which candidate wins and assuming they both implement the things that they say, the positions that they have taken at this point. Biden administration more business regulation could slowdown business' ability to continue to grow. Higher taxes would obviously hit profits and earnings per share and then obviously, the impact of the overall stock market. And as you said, President Trump wants to continue to try to bring manufacturing jobs back and maintain or improve the current tax situation. But anyway, we will be impacted as much because of how our customers are impacted by whoever wins as anything else. So I think that as a general statement, because our customer and prospect base is such a broad spectrum of American industry that as American industry goes, we will go with it. I will say this, I am confident because we have managed through different versions of what different administrations have brought to into the U.S. economy that we can manage through this that we will manage through it as we have in the past, we got a really good track record of improvement that we can do that. And so we're optimistic either way about the long-term future of the company, I think that there may be some short-term differences that could come to bear depending on who wins. Toni Kaplan : And just as a follow up. Just looking at the balance sheet kind of decent size inventory build the last two quarters. Just wanted to understand what's causing the increase, is that preparation for an eventual recovery and do you expect that to continue? How should we be thinking about that going forward? Todd Schneider : Toni, this is Todd. We see our balance sheet as an advantage. We see our ability to distribute as an advantage. And our customers need us to invest in those products in the short term so that we can help them with those. So in many cases, it has been a real competitive advantage us investing in that inventory where we have products that our competition does not. And our customers really appreciate the investment on their behalf and we're leveraging that. Scott Farmer : This is Scott. Much of that buildup is in some of the items that are in high demand right now. The hand sanitizer and there you got to look at that in a lot of different ways. It\u2019s the actual fluid itself, the container that comes in, the dispensing units that we need, the stands and so forth. And so there is a build up of that inventory. But these are things that we are doing to take advantage of the opportunities that are in the marketplace right now. And we're very confident that because we've been able to do this and do it in such short order that we are winning business daily, because we have inventory. We talked about -- one of the examples I gave earlier on was that we got a very large account, because we were able to deliver masks in a matter of days that other companies were telling that prospect it would take months to get those. We had another example of a large customer, multilocation customer that decided to give a third of their hand sanitizer stand business to us, a third one of our competitors and a third competitor. We implemented that program with thousands of stands in a week. One of the competitors came back and said we can't deliver it within your timeframe. So they gave us that third. We did that the next week thousands of stands. And the third competitor can only do about half of what they said they could do so they're giving us half of that third of the business. And it's because we have the inventory available today to service those accounts. And so we look at that and what we've been able to do with our global supply chain, and our ability to get those products out into the marketplace quickly as a significant competitive advantage and we're taking advantage of it right now. Operator : Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel Nicholas. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Hey, usually in labor intensive businesses, hiring is really indicative of what companies think is coming down the pike in demand. And I know you guys had a hiring freeze not that long ago looking at your open positions now between 1,600 and 1,700 open positions. Could you just discuss -- is that a normal amount of positions you'd have open? If there were not a pandemic, is it a higher amount because there\u2019s a catch up? Is there a lower amount? How should I think of this in terms of indicating what you guys are thinking about? Todd Schneider : Shlomo, this is Todd. So I can't answer your specific -- I don't track requisitions by what we have out there by month. But I can tell you that it's certainly an increase from what it was 90 days ago. And we're on -- we try to match up our demand for our services, the supply of our products or services, our infrastructure, our people and we're matching it up appropriately. So we look forward to Q2, Q3 and Q4 and we see demand continue to increase. We're certainly conscious of all the external factors, whether they'd be what's going on with the pandemic, what's going on with the election, all those items but we're investing for the future. And we're bringing back to those folks many, many of which are revenue generating partners that will help us continue our positive trend. Shlomo Rosenbaum : And then maybe you could give a little bit more color on how you're thinking of the business units. I believe last quarter you guys gave little bit more detail on that in terms of the next quarter. I don\u2019t know if you want to talk at that granular level this quarter as well? Mike Hansen : So, Shlomo you were a little hard to hear, I think your question was regarding how each of our businesses is performing as we enter the second quarter and how do we feel about that performance. And Shlomo, I would say that the first of all as guidance encompasses all of what I'm going to mention. But Todd talked a little bit about the momentum of the rental business and we continue to see a nice trend line, even though it's moderated a bit from that heavy disruptive period early in this first quarter. But we still continue to add really good new business and we're continuing to sell these hygiene products that Todd talked a bit about. In our first aid and safety, we've had two quarters of high-teens growth, and Scott talk a little bit about -- these are big sales of personal protective equipment are hard to predict. And so they happen but then they generally will go into maintenance mode. And so our expectation is we'll see a little bit more maintenance mode in the first aid and safety business in Q2. But still very, very good results. We are very excited about that business. The fire business, which was down organically about 12% in the fourth quarter, was down organically just over 5% in this first quarter. And now that business continues to perform well and continue to move on and improving trend line. And then lastly Scott talked a little bit about our direct sales business, which was down 47% in the first quarter, and probably see that as another quarter of pretty difficult time given that customer base. So that's the way we view the second quarter, keeping in mind that it is at the mid point and higher end of that guidance, it calls for sequential improvement and nice sequential improvement of that. So again, we like the momentum of the business and the execution of it as well. Did that answer your question, Shlomo? Shlomo Rosenbaum : Yeah, thank you very much. Operator : And it appears there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to our presenters for any additional or closing comments. Paul Adler : All right. Well, thank you for joining us this morning and for your interest in Cintas. We will issue our second quarter of fiscal '21 financial results in December, and look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Have a good day. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Paul Adler : Thank you, and thank you everyone for joining us. With me today is Scott Farmer, Cintas Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Todd Schneider, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our second quarter results for fiscal 2021. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Scott Farmer. Scott Farmer : Thank you, Paul and good morning, everyone. The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic remains a significant disruption to the economy. In the final month of our fiscal second quarter, November, the COVID-19 virus counts surged from about 100,000 per day at the beginning of the month to about 250,000 per day now. Not surprisingly economic indicators such as jobs growth, unemployment, and retail spending reflect an economic recovery that slowed considerably as the fall months progressed and the virus counts increased. Despite the macroeconomic headwinds, I\u2019m pleased with our second quarter financial performance, which exceeded expectations. Our employees, whom we call partners have not wavered in their passion for getting businesses ready for the workday. They're providing essential products and services to help keep our customers and their places of business clean and safe. These include hand sanitizer services, professionally laundered healthcare scrubs and isolation gowns, first aid products, sanitizing wipes, face masks, gloves, and fire protection services as well as many others. The conversion of no programmers, the do-it-yourselfers, if you will, remains robust. Our supply chain and service network enable us to increase service to existing customers and add new customers by procuring and providing items in short supply. And our Net Promoter Score, which we use to measure customer satisfaction has risen dramatically to an all-time high. We find ourselves today, however, at a time of increasing uncertainty. A number of states and municipalities have reinstituted temporary economic restrictions in response to rising COVID-19 cases. Others are considering them. On the other hand, vaccines are being distributed and the U.S. government continues to discuss additional economic stimulus. The uncertainty of the resolutions of these impactful events makes providing near-term guidance very difficult. Therefore, we're not providing financial guidance at this time. However, if we're able to gain clarity before the end of the quarter, we'll provide an update in advance of our third quarter earnings release. That said, there is much that does remain certain. Our employee partners reflect the steadfast Cintas culture. They're always striving to exceed the expectations of our customers to maximize the long-term value of Cintas for its shareholders, employee partners, and other stakeholders. The result is consistently strong financial performance with Cintas growing revenue and EPS 49 of the past 51 years. I remain certain of our value proposition of getting businesses ready for the workday by providing essential unparalleled image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance. It is never resonated more than it does today. I remain certain of our addressable market, namely the millions upon millions of businesses that are not currently Cintas customers, many of whom are not in a program with recurring service but could benefit from at least one Cintas product or service, and I'm certain that Cintas is well positioned for years to come. Now I'll turn it over to Mike for commentary on the financial results of the quarter. Mike? Mike Hansen : Thank you, Scott, and good morning. Our fiscal 2021 second quarter revenue was $1.76 billion compared to $1.84 billion in last year\u2019s second quarter. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations or EPS were $2.62, an increase of 15.4% from last year\u2019s second quarter. Organic revenue adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations declined 4.4% for the second quarter of fiscal '21. Organic revenue for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment declined 3.6%. Organic revenue for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment increased 14.5%. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '21 was $819.9 million compared to $852.4 million in last year\u2019s second quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased 50 basis points to 46.7% for the second quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 46.2% in the second quarter of fiscal '20. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 26.6% in the second quarter of fiscal '21 and 28.1% last year. Fiscal '21 second quarter results benefited from lower discretionary spending and increased sales rep productivity. Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal '21 of $352.9 million increased 5.5%. Operating margin was 20.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 18.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '20. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '21 was 13.3% compared to 20.1% last year. Tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '21 was $284.9 million, an increase of 15.7%. EPS was $2.62, an increase of 15.4% from last year\u2019s second quarter. In the second quarter of fiscal '21, certain Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating assets were sold. The pre-tax gain on sale of $18 million was recorded in the selling and administrative expenses and impacted operating margin by 100 basis points. The pre-tax gain and related tax benefit impacted EPS by $0.25. Our balance sheet and cash flow remained strong. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6x debt to EBITDA. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. For financial modeling purposes, please note that there is one more workday in our fiscal '21 than in our fiscal 20. One more day will benefit fiscal '21 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. One more workday also benefits operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '21 operating margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20 due to one more day of revenue. In fiscal '20, each quarter contains 65 workdays. In fiscal '21, workdays by quarter are 66 in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3, and 66 in Q4. Please keep these differences in mind when modeling on a year-over-year and sequential basis. I'll now turn the call over to Todd Schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses. Todd Schneider : Thank you, Mike. As Scott stated, COVID-19 remains a significant disruption to the economy. Every business in the U.S and Canada has been impacted. Many of our customers that have remained open are not yet operating at the same level of business as before the pandemic started because of the virus has negative impact on health and the economy. Our employee partners continue to work with urgency to offset these headwinds. Over the past couple of quarters, we've provided some examples of their interactions with both new and existing customers to give a better understanding. Many of those examples highlighted customers in the industries of healthcare, education, and state and local government and products and services including scrubs, hand sanitizer service and masks. For the second quarter of the fiscal year, the amount of Uniform Rental and Facility Services new business sold to healthcare, education, and government customers is double the amount in the prior-year period. And the amount of First Aid, Fire, and Other new business sold to customers in healthcare, education, and government is 6x the amount sold in the same period last year. Some of this new business is reoccurring and some may not repeat. Nevertheless, the results are really impressive. Also, the number of scrub dispensing machines installed in our first two quarters doubled last year's number, and since the virus appeared, our employee partners that provided businesses with over 350,000 hand sanitizer dispensers and over 125 million masks. I\u2019m truly in awe of the accomplishments of our team in this challenging time. And I'm excited about the opportunities for Cintas post pandemic which seems to be finally appearing on the horizon. With that, I'll turn now to the second quarter financial performance of our businesses. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health care spreads, mats, and towels in the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.41 billion compared to $1.47 billion last year. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 47.5% for the second quarter, compared to 46.6% in last year's second quarter. Higher inventory amortization expense of 80 basis points was more than offset by the benefits of lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $194.4 million compared to $169.7 million last year. The First Aid segment gross margin was 43.0% in the second quarter, compared to 48.4% in last year's second quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year's second quarter were more than offset by higher cost of goods sold from the increased proportion of revenue from personal protective equipment, such as masks, and gloves. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses are reported in the all other category. Our Fire business historically grows each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct Sale business growth rates are generally low single digits, and are subject to volatility such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Uniform Direct sale, however, is a key business for us and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross sell and provide products and services from our other business units. All other revenue was $152.1 million compared to $204.1 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue declined 3.3% due to the inability to access some businesses because of closures. The Uniform Direct Sale business organic revenue declined 51.2%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality and gaming customers largely falls within this segment. These industries continue to be among the hardest hit by the pandemic. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Andrew Steinerman with J.P. Morgan. Andrew Steinerman : Good morning, everyone. Could you give us a sense about the month of November in terms of organic revenue trends for rental, and if you can make a comment into the month of December that would be great. Scott Farmer : Hi, Andrew, this is Scott. Yes, we can give you a little bit more color on that. Through the quarter, we continue to see an improving revenue trend for the month of November, and the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment, the rental organic growth was minus 1%. First Aid and Safety for the month of November organic growth was 14%, and Fire continued to improve through the quarter, and it ended November with the month of November down 1%. And it's important to note that about mid November, we did see the impact of some of the state's restrictions on businesses. It -- I would say it affected the trend, but it hadn't turned it worse than it had been at that point. So, it's a little unpredictable on where it goes. But as you can see through the month of November, we continued on a positive trend. I think second quarter revenue sequentially grew about 2.7% over first quarter. Andrew Steinerman : Could you make a comment about December? Scott Farmer : I would say through the first couple of weeks, we were running around where we were in November. Andrew Steinerman : Great. Okay. Thanks, Scott. Scott Farmer : Yes. Operator : We'll take our next question from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Seth Weber : Hey guys, good morning. I had a couple of questions on the margins. I think, I'm just trying to handicap where we're at with expenses coming back online. I think, Mike, I think last quarter you talked about there's about 100 bps, 100 basis points of lower discretionary. Has any of the -- have any of those costs started to come back here in the second quarter, and how should we think about that, kind of through the rest of the year? Thanks. Mike Hansen : Yes, we continue to manage those costs pretty tightly given the environment that we're in. The difference between last year's travel and meetings, which I call out is a 100 basis points in Q1 was about 40 basis points in Q2. Now Q1, we normally travel more as we start our fiscal year, but it was still about a 40-basis-point benefit. And we'll continue to monitor the situation. Certainly, I know that our operational people are itching to get out and see our locations and our customers but given the levels of cases -- COVID cases and the environment, we're going to remain pretty tight on those. Seth Weber : Okay. Can you just talk about -- have you seen any relief on the cost side on the First Aid and Safety category? I know there have been some cost pressures there. Have that -- has that kind of loosened up here a little bit with more as weather supplies has gotten a little looser or just easier to get? Just any comments on the First Aid and Safety expense cost side? Todd Schneider : Seth, this is Todd. Regarding the First Aid business, certainly there are some PPE type items that are still very challenging to get. We are -- we've been blessed to be in a good inventory position to help our customers out with those items, but PPE is in short supply. It had some impact on cost to us in those cases. But again, we've looked at it with a long lens, and we've invested appropriately, and our customers really appreciate the fact that we've been able to provide products and services, such as PPE and other items to help them get through this challenging time. Mike Hansen : We do like, Seth, the sequential improvement of gross margin of just about 40% in Q1 to 43% in Q2, and so we're -- we did see some nice performance in our First Aid cabinets in the quarter. And as we talked about at the -- in September, that mix of PPE obviously came down a bit with the growth moving from -- in that segment from over 20% in Q4 to 17% to 14.5% here in Q2. So, we're starting to see some of those PPEs turn into the maintenance mode that we've talked about in the last couple quarters, and that mix change as well as the improving First Aid cabinet has helped that gross margin, and we will -- when we get to a more normalized environment, we certainly believe that those First Aid gross margins are going to trend back towards where we had been pre-COVID. There's nothing structural or no change in the business that would lead us to believe otherwise. Operator : We will take our next question from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. You mentioned that in the first several weeks of December, Uniform Rental trends are running around where you were back in November. Can you discuss changes you've seen, if any, around new business and retention trends over the past several weeks? Scott Farmer : Yes. Our new business numbers continue to perform very well. They -- we still believe that the value proposition that we have is important in this current environment, and so we're continuing to attract new customers. We have seen -- we haven't seen a change in lost business rates at this point. We have seen because of government restrictions, some customers going back on a fold, meaning they're temporarily closing the business until the restrictions are lifted. And that would be the change that we've seen since about mid-November in the economy. Those restrictions are various states and cities, it's California, it's Illinois, it's New York, other states, Washington, Oregon, and even up in Toronto. So, these are the places that we see those type of restrictions that are impacting our customers, but from a lost business standpoint, we haven't seen a real change in lost business rates. George Tong : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then, can you talk a little bit about how much growth you're seeing from the non-programmer market versus your existing customers, and how much health care as a vertical is contributing to growth directly? Scott Farmer : Sure. The no programmer market for us -- we've tracked it for many years, it's between 60% and 65% of our new business customers. It remains in that range today. And as I said, in my opening remarks, there are millions of businesses out there that do not have a program that we can offer them. And so we like our position and our ability to convert them. Even within the health care space, there are -- if you define a no programmer as somebody who doesn't have a rental program, most of the scrubs that you see in hospitals are direct sale type scrubs, some of them bought by individual health care workers, some by the hospital for departments and things like that. But converting them to a rental program, we would call a conversion of a no programmer. The other area that we're seeing in health care that's doing really well are isolation gowns. Those are traditionally direct sale disposable gowns. And we have a rentable alternative that actually saves the hospitals and health care providers money to convert from a direct sale program to a rental program. So we're seeing a lot of success in that as well. And that would be what we would consider a no programmer conversion within health care. Todd Schneider : George, it's Todd. Just to build off a couple of items that Scott mentioned. Our no programmer as a business as a percent of our total, is -- it remains quite consistent. What is changing is, it is allowing us to get audiences to folks customers, prospects that we haven't had in the past in many cases, because of the access we have to critical products and services that they need to provide to their business and within their business to either their customers or to their employees, both so that they can have confidence to come to work and for people to come into their business. Scott spoke about some of the -- in the medical area have been very successful, the isolation gowns, hand sanitizer, sanitizer wipes, disinfectant wipes, scrubs are all -- are -- it's in great demand. Scott mentioned that the isolation gowns were -- that was virtually almost the entire market was a direct purchase, market purchase disposable market, probably the best way to describe it. And what we've done with isolation gowns has been very attractive to our prospects and our customers. It's a green service, right? We're not just throwing in the trash, we're reusing it. It save them significant money. The availability of them, instead of folks struggling to get isolation gowns and being panicked over trying to take care of their patients. What we -- the garments that we\u2019re providing are more comfortable than what they've been wearing in the past. And then lastly, we brought some technology to that business so that we can track exactly how many times those garments have been processed. So we can meet the specifications that are detailed out for such a product. So that's been a big win and a lot of health care customers are very, very interested in that. And we mentioned in our previous earnings release that the demand for scrubs has been up very nicely. People are uncomfortable in many cases wearing those home, washing those at home, and whom they come in contact with on the way home makes people little uncomfortable. So all that has been quite good demand. In those cases we consider those no programmers we might be doing some business with those, those health care organizations, but we're expanding that relationship dramatically. Operator : We'll take our next question from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Mario Cortellacci : Hi. This is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. Appreciate the time. Just -- on touching on the flowing in November and the continuation into December, could you maybe just give us a level deeper in terms of what you're seeing on your end market? I'd imagine it's probably similar to what we saw earlier in the year, excuse me, with the high risk industries being hit a little harder. But is that more or less what you're seeing? Or could you give us some of the puts and takes on some of your end market exposure? Scott Farmer : Yes. Sure. It boils down to certain industry segments, or geographies. And the segments that you can imagine, the travel, hotels, cruise lines, even in certain areas, restaurants, movie theatres, that type of thing are being hit the hardest, because of these restrictions and people's [technical difficulty] natural fear to go and congregate in a place like a movie theatre. The geographies depend on what type of or if there are any restrictions in place. And what we\u2019ve seen so far is, as we got through the end of November, it's an increase in the number of states and municipalities that have put restrictions in place. We don't know whether that trend is going to continue through the holidays. And just as an example, Governor Newsom in California, put the restrictions in place, they're pretty tight, but he says that they will extend to January the 4th. The question that we have there is, will he extend that further? Which has been his tendency, or will it actually be January the 4th when he starts to loosen those restrictions. So those states are the -- and municipalities are the areas where we've seen the change since about mid-November. And my perspective is that we are in a temporary low, we don't think it's going to be anywhere near what it was in our fourth quarter last year. Quite honestly, at that point, nobody, including governors and people running businesses, at any idea how bad it was going to be, how deep it was going to go and so forth. But now that we've got 8 or 9 months worth of experience in dealing with it, and the fact that we have vaccines beginning to roll out right now, there's light at the end of the tunnel, this is a temporary period of time that we're going to go through. And so, that I hope provides a little color to you. I'm happy to get more specific in any area, if you have any question. Mario Cortellacci : No, that was helpful. And then going back to health care for a second, just I guess, could you give us a sense of what the competitive landscape looked like there? So I think reasonably one of your competitors came out with a new scrub line. You had mentioned the isolation gowns as being one of your differentiated products, which is, I\u2019m assuming, helping you win business. Just wondering how those conversations are going with customers regarding competition? And then also could you touch on how you're positioning your scrub dispensing system to your advantage? Scott Farmer : Yes. Todd, you want to take this one, and I'll chime in. Todd Schneider : Sure. Okay, great. Mario, I would say in the health care market, it depends upon what area within the health care area, acute, non acute, even frankly into what department you're speaking of. But generally speaking, ISO gowns, scrubs, et cetera, those are direct purchase market, in the case of ISO gown disposable, the most common way people procure those products. Lending companies certainly are in that space, those who provide services to those types of customers. But if I generally describe, it would be -- it's a direct purchase or disposable market with any re-usables would be traditionally with a [indiscernible] companies would be the most common experience. As far as the scrub dispensing, it is -- it's been going extremely well for our business and our customers. The demand is there because it's a -- well, I think most people can kind of see the experience where you go into a grocery store and you see people wearing scrubs, right, and those belong to the hospital normally. And what happens is because both struggled to get access to scrub, they tend to hoard them. And as they hoard them, they have to buy more scrubs and when they do that are in that tough situation, they tend to buy the cheapest scrub they can, because they end up disappearing. And we completely change the value proposition there and we provide a scrub that people want to wear, not just have to wear. Its comfortable, attractive and we're continuing to invest in that area and come out with more better technology around the fabrics, et cetera. And it makes it completely accessible, meaning there's a complete accountability. So when you want a scrub, you can get it, you have complete access, and then it's laundered for you. So they don't have to take it home. So it has been really attractive for our health care customers. And as I mentioned in the opening remarks, we've installed twice the amount of scrubs that we did last year at the same time, so far through Q2. So a great momentum and we're very encouraged. Scott Farmer : Let me add just -- this is Scott. Let me add one thing relative to the competition. And Todd mentioned that it is traditionally a direct sale items, scrubs and isolation gowns and that sort of thing. And so I think the thing that is helpful to you all to understand is that it is really difficult, and I don't know that it's even a concept that a traditional direct sale competitor would even consider, would be to try and develop a laundry service to do that. So we're providing a unique opportunity for a customer to convert to a rental program where the traditional competition can't, they don't have the ability to do that. And that is a big significant competitive advantage for us versus the traditional supplier that and we believe that because of the technology we brought, the scrub machines, the dispensing units that keep inventory tracking and our ability to control how often a isolation gown is processed before we pull it out of service. These are the kind of things that for traditional competition they can't do. Relative to other rental companies that would be linen companies and uniform rental companies, we've been in this for a long time. We have trained sales people and service providers that specialize in the health care market. And we think we have a multiyear head start on what you would probably consider to be our traditional rental competitor. And we like that position a lot. And I think that's why you're seeing the amount of success for us as we've gone through this process and through the pandemic that we're seeing. So I just thought I'd offer that as some color relative to health care as well. Operator : We'll take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning. Scott, if I could just ask you just again from a competitive standpoint, just some broader commentary, I guess outside of health care, like have you seen any changing dynamics that people are getting tight, aggressive, or is it some more consolidation going on? Just curious, any color there? Scott Farmer : Yes. Let's -- we'll talk competitive, maybe competitive behavior and pricing. We have seen some aggressive pricing in the marketplace. I think that as competition sees their business, existing customer base, have issues and decline in revenue, they typically get aggressive with pricing. I don't think this is anything that we haven't seen in the past relative to low ball prices and competition trying to take business from us. And that's a market by market type of a environment and it could be in any particular market. The small players or one of the big national players in that market that decide they need to do something to try to win some accounts. Relative to overall pricing, though, while we have had to adjust prices on fluctuating items like gloves and face masks and hand sanitizer and the PPE kind of things, as our costs increased trying to get those products we had had to adjust prices upward on those items. For our recurring revenue across all of our businesses really, we have not increased prices during the pandemic and in fact for as a general statement, particularly in the rental division, we haven't increased our price through our customers in about a year and a half. And that's a strategic decision on our part. We don't think that during a global pandemic is the right time to be raising prices. And I think that's one element of why we've seen our Net Promoter Scores, how we measure customer satisfaction be impacted to the positive. And so that's our position on pricing at this point. Todd Schneider : Scott, if I may -- Manav, just a couple items on that regarding our approach with our customers. Scott mentioned pricing hasn't, recurring revenue pricing hasn't gone up in 18 months or plus. And our approach to our customers was to be, we call it caring, consistent and flexible. Meaning we know it's a very challenging time for our customer base and our prospect base, so we wanted to take the appropriate approach. Scott mentioned that it's showing up in our customer satisfaction scores, which we track via Net Promoter Scores. And we look at it as what's the lifetime value of those customers. And we want to have those customers for a lifetime, and not take a short-term approach. And I think, again, that's showing up in our Net Promoter Scores, and I think it's going to show for a long-term in how customers look at us. Manav Patnaik : Got it. That's helpful. And also I think you've given examples on how basically your scale plays totally to your advantage in these time shares those kind of heightened demand. Have you seen, maybe some of your smaller competitors just going to be financially constrained? And is that present even more opportunities now? Scott Farmer : Well, yes, we -- I always like to say we're an equal opportunity competitor. And if any of our competition in a particular market is having a hard time with either getting supplies, getting the product that they need, having trouble with servicing their customers, we're more than happy to step in and provide those products and services through those customers. From time-to-time, we do see an issue with the competitor, and we will react accordingly in -- on a customer-by-customer, prospect-by-prospect basis, if you will, relative to that. I don't know that it's because of the -- it's still a little uncertain in where this is all going to go and how quickly it's going to end, different opinions on that. But I do think that it could provide a future opportunity for acquisition. I think that there would probably be a desire on the part of a potential seller to try to get their revenue back to where it was pre-COVID to have something larger to sell. But with that we'll deal with those kind of situations as they come up, but that is obviously an opportunity for us as well. Operator : We'll take our next question from Andrew Wittmann with Baird. Andrew Wittmann : Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. I think this one's probably for Mike. And just kind of looking back here on calendar 2020, it's obviously been a remarkable year, challenging year for so many people. I mean the thing that most investors will look back and think about Cintas and how you manage through this and seeing your margin percentage go up despite the revenue is declining. And so, Mike, I guess the question is, we look ahead to really just high levels I'm looking for here, as we're almost about to analyze the COVID comps, if you will, how should we be thinking about the margins? I mean, you guys have articulated the travel [indiscernible] discretionary, 100 basis points last quarter, 40 this quarter of benefit. But other buckets out there that could be margin headwinds as you hit the year and analyze the COVID things, I don\u2019t know things like incentive compensation, fuel prices, other things that might have to come back in, on the production side of things, what else should we be thinking about from a high level as investors that could come back and as we hit the year mark on COVID. Mike Hansen : Yes, it's been a challenging year. And the -- it is required a lot of different managing of the different costs, cost structures. And it certainly has been a challenge. But as we move forward, look, we -- there are certainly some things that we have learned about some of our costs like travel, and can we do some things more efficiently. And I think there will be permanent savings on some of those things. There will be some of that that comes back. But I don't think we're going to see 100 basis points of movement in something like that. And so as look forward, Andrew, I would say this, we're -- we want to grow over the course of the long-term. We will continue to staff revenue producing positions, to prepare ourselves to grow, and that may mean a little bit more bench in our service departments and in our sales departments. And that will probably create a little bit of additional spending. But having said that, Scott manage the business very, very well in this period of time, and I would expect that that is going to continue. We will continue to be very, very cognizant of our margins and our costs and recognizing that our goal is to continue to see very healthy incremental margins. So, Andrew, I don't there's not really anything that I would point to other than a little bit of that travel coming back, and a little bit more of the staffing of revenue producing positions that are needed for growth. Andrew Wittmann : Okay, great. That's my only question for today. Have a good holiday season, guys. Scott Farmer : Thank you. Mike Hansen : Thank you. Scott Farmer : You too. Operator : We'll take our next question from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Tim Mulrooney : Yes, good morning. Just one for me as well on employee retention, which I know is a key initiative for the firm and something y'all track pretty closely. I'm curious how that's trended through the pandemic. You get with furloughs and disruptions to your routes, from temporary shutdowns. If employee turnover has been something that's been harder to manage over the last several quarters, or it's actually been easier because the labor market isn't as tight as it's been relative to the last several years. Thank you. Todd Schneider : Tim, this is Todd. Thanks for the question. Employee, what we call partner retention is never easy. But I will say that our performance, since the start of the pandemic, it's has been impressive, results are continuing to improve. We have -- our partner base is an impressive group of folks who are relentless, creative, and very proud of what they're doing on a daily basis to help businesses function in this environment and function successfully. So there's an [indiscernible] in the organization, that they're very proud of what they do. And we've got a great group of leaders and frontline partners all throughout that we're very happy with. And so yes, it's going quite well. And we're really encouraged about that, as we move through. When you go through really hard things, right, and this going through this pandemic has been extremely challenging, not just for ourselves, but for, I'd say, well, you can say the world, right, that it's been very challenging, but it makes you better makes you stronger and we have found out a lot about our partners, and how resilient they are and it's been a real pleasure. Tim Mulrooney : That's great. Great color Todd. Thank you. Scott Farmer : Thank you, Tim. Operator : We'll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with BFA Securities. Gary Bisbee : Hey, good morning. First of all, I just wanted to clarify one thing. Todd you said health care, education, government customers, I believe you said new businesses doubled year-over-year but then you said something else up [indiscernible]. What were those numbers? Yes, that right. We are happy to clarify. So both I was thinking of both sectors, excuse me. Two different sectors. One for rental, our rental and facility services business. those sectors, the health care, education and government, new businesses have doubled in that area. And in the case of First Aid, Fire and other, our new business, again, for health care, education, government is up six packs. Now, as I mentioned in the opening remarks, not all that will be repeating, Some will not, but nevertheless, we're really, really encouraged by how well we're doing in those areas of our business. Gary Bisbee : Can you give us some color on the rest of the end markets you serve? I mean, obviously, those you've been calling out, and it makes sense that you're doing really well. But is the rest of the book down on a new business, or how do we think about sort of total Cintas at this point, including the good and the bad? Mike Hansen : Yes. So in total, our new business is very good. We're very encouraged by that. The trend lines are great. The productivity is at an all-time high. It's replacing a lot of revenue of customers that are closed. And for those, it's also replacing a lot of revenue for customers who are maybe open, but certainly not at the same levels as what we'd expected in a new more normalized type economy. Gary Bisbee : Okay. And then just if I could one financial question on cash flow, it's obviously been quite strong. How do you think about two factors. One, CapEx coming back to more normal levels? Is that just a matter of revenue getting back and you\u2019re bringing the spend back or anything else we should think timing. And then the other one on inventory, inventory days is up a lot, I guess, in part sales down, but also building inventory for all these newer items, PP&E and whatnot, how do you think about inventory levels in a more normalized revenue environment at some point in the future? Are they likely to be higher than they've been? And is that something that will continue to build and have an impact on capital. Thank you. Todd Schneider : Well, let's start with CapEx. I think that we're going to probably see CapEx remain below historical levels until we get through the COVID crisis and the economy recovers. But I'd still say that even today, we're probably spending CapEx at a 60% growth 40% maintenance level. So -- but I just think it's going to be lower until we get through this, everybody is a little more cautious and that sort of thing. Relative to inventory, it's important that I think we make the statement that, that we are doing the best job that we can to manage the supply chain and the supply of these hard to get items with the demand that we're seeing from our customer base. And that's the primary reason you're seeing an increase in this inventory, I don't believe that we're going to see a sudden drop off in the need for these products. I think it'll be a slow, steady decline. And we'll have some view on that as the economy recovers. And as COVID vaccines continue to roll out, many of these are going to be around at a higher level than pre-COVID for a long, long time. And so, we're -- we haven't seen any issues with slow moving inventory at that point, or anything like that. But I will tell you that the fact that we have been able to bring these products into inventory, the way that we have has been a huge competitive advantage for us in the marketplace, where because we might have masks or gloves or hand sanitizer, prospects who ordinarily have not been doing business with us listen to and react to our ability to provide them with these COVID related products. And then also listen to what else we can do for them. And so it might be a call where a company is interested in hand sanitizer, and we wind up after sales rep is out talking to them, where they're putting 10 people in uniform and restroom supplies in the restroom and entrance mats and mops and cleaning chemicals and so forth, in addition to the hand sanitizer. So it's been a big competitive advantage for us as we've gone through this process. And I think one of the reasons why our NPS customer satisfaction scores are up, as well as we're seeing very robust new business results. So I think the balance sheet that we have is allowed us to be able to make that investment. Our supply chain has done a great job in sourcing it. And I think that it's reflected in our ability to sell new accounts and satisfy our customers. Operator : Let's take our next question from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thanks so much. Hey, I wonder if you could give us a sense of across the client base, how many are in percentage numbers? Maybe how many are inactive today? And is there a way to think about where the average customer is in terms of percentage of prior peak, just to get a sense of just the potential to scale as things start to reaccelerate from a COVID perspective, we are covering that. Scott Farmer : That's difficult for us to say, because in many ways, it's a moving target. We have had customers that were open, and then because of a regulation or restriction had to shut down temporarily open back up some of the customers that are open or open only at 50% capacity or at a lower level than they were. But we haven't gotten into those figures because it moves around so much that if I tell you something today, it could be different next week. And so we -- depending on who might apply new restrictions, and so forth. So we haven't gotten into that level of detail. And I hesitate to do that only because I think it might be a little misleading, only because it moves around so much. Kevin McVeigh : Okay. Thank you. And then just in the kind of post-COVID world, you think about how much of the demand is structural. Is there a way to think about that, again, to the core business, and to me, it seems like, obviously, health care is going to be a more significant contributor to the business, but just any incremental step up and how much of that is kind of structural versus maybe starts to kind of normalize. Scott Farmer : We've learned a lot as we've gone through this process. And I think that one of the really positive aspects of this whole thing is that we have done a much better job of communicating to existing customers, and even prospects, all of the things that we can do for them. And therefore are selling more to existing customers and a new prospect that might come on board, they may only start with a particular service, but because they're aware of the other things that we have to offer, when they see that need, they know who to call, that has been a structural change for us. And I believe that the things that we have to offer, these customers are things that they're going to be using in the long-term within their businesses to help keep their businesses, their employees, and their customers safe. Have a clean environment for them to work in, be compliant with the regulations and in the Fire business, Insurance company requirements and so forth. So we're excited about the position that we -- that we're in right now. And as I look to the future, I'm really excited about where all this can go. Todd Schneider : Kevin, it's Todd. As an example \u2026 Kevin McVeigh : Hey, Todd. Todd Schneider : \u2026 that we mentioned that in a previous call that there's a large national bank chain that we were doing zero business with and now we're providing hand sanitizer to every single branch that they have. And we're -- in addition to that, we're talking to them about other facilities products that they are in need of. We're also talking to them about our Fire service, which, as you can imagine they need all that. It's just a matter of where they're getting it from and centralizing spend, in many cases, saving money. So it's just one example of what is occurring hundreds of times every single day out there with our sales and service organization. As Scott mentioned, really positions us well because there's people in the past who really wouldn't take our calls. And now they will because of our inventory position and our infrastructure, and that helps. That helps position us for the long-term in a really healthy manner. Kevin McVeigh : Makes a ton of sense. I've noticed a lot of dispensers being kind of installed and things like that that just historically weren't there. And that bodes well for the future. So thank you. Todd Schneider : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. Good morning. In the Other segment, I'm just curious, how is your visibility there? You're obviously experiencing some new win and seeing some struggles. But if you could break it down on between Fire and Direct Sales, there's a sense of the visibility you have. And this is the essence of the question is, you've done a nice job managing margin there is the -- how does the visibility correspond with your ability to manage your OpEx? Thanks. Scott Farmer : Well, the Fire service business is recovering similar to the Rental and Facility services segment there. I mentioned earlier, that their November organic growth rate was off 1% from pre COVID levels. But so we have a pretty good view of what's happening in that business. And I think that will -- similar to what happens with the rest of the economy and what we\u2019re -- what happens with the rental division, we'll see that recover in a similar fashion. Relative to the Direct Sale business, a good portion of that business goes into hospitality and travel related areas. That's a little murkier, and I think that -- those are hotels, airlines, cruise ships, casinos and food service and that sort of segment. So those are going to be, I think, the longer tail from a recovery standpoint. But I think that there will be a day coming, where they're going to get a pretty good bump. I think there is a my personal opinion, a huge amount of pent-up demand for people to be able to go back on vacation, to stay in a hotel to feel safe when they get on an airplane and that sort of thing. And there's a point at which when the vaccines have been rolled out to perhaps reach herd immunity. You can see airlines throw in some special rates at travelers to welcome them back, hotels and resorts doing the same kind of thing. I think you can see Las Vegas doing everything that they can to get their customers to come back and who knows that maybe that's early next summer, depending on the rate of vaccinations and things like that. But if it's going to work in those businesses, it's also going to work in other businesses. People are going to be able to go back out to their restaurants and their movie theatres locally, and maybe go to the concert venue and do the social things that bars and do the social things that they're missing right now. And I think that is coming. When it happens, we need a little bit more time to understand the rate of rollout for the vaccines. And that's why I continue to say that we're in a temporary role in this. And as we get a little further out and get a little more clarity, we're going to see, I think, some economic activity pick up and we are maybe a couple of quarters away from that maybe on an improving quarter-by-quarter basis as those vaccines rollout. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks, Scott. I appreciate that color. And just as a follow-up. I\u2019m curious on your appetite for M&A and what you're seeing out there is you\u2019re clearly in a position of power as you\u2019ve kind of discussed over the course of the call. And then maybe $0.02 on the move to the quarterly dividend and just [indiscernible] on the whole return of capital strategy of the [indiscernible]? Thanks. Scott Farmer : Yes. So relative to the dividend, that -- we were the sort of the last person standing relative to and giving out annual dividends. We thought and have talked about it at a Board level for a long time and made a decision to make the change. I think it's -- we have shareholders that we've heard from in the past about cash flow and that sort of thing. So we -- we've reacted to that. We think it was a good change for us. We think it's a good change for the shareholders as well. And remind me the first part of the question was \u2026 Mike Hansen : M&A, Scott. Scott Farmer : Oh, M&A. Okay. Thank you, Mike. I'm sorry. You probably dropped off, but M&A, yes. We are cautious right now because of where we are in the recovery. But we are in a position where we could do M&A acquisitions in any of our businesses. We'd evaluate them pretty heavily right now, just to make sure we understand, how well that particular business is doing. But we would be acquisitive, if we could find the right deal the right business at the right price, I think that, as I said earlier, I think there's a -- there is an element of concern on the sellers part, if their revenue is below where it was pre-COVID, that they're going to get out of the business, what they need to get out of the business, should they sell it. And so there may be a little bit of a lull there. But I think as the economy continues to pick up, we'll probably see, M&A activity pick up. And, if that's the case, we sure would like to be a player there. Operator : We'll take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. I was hoping you could provide some clarification on the operating assets that were sold during the quarter. Trying to understand what those were and was that a cost saving measure, given the uncertainty? And does this reduce future capacity at all? And just how does it impact the run rate margin structure, if at all? Thanks. Scott Farmer : Yes, yes, sure. It was really just a couple of key focuses, we had some operations in some pretty remote geographies that those particular geographies didn't lend themselves to have an opportunity for a lot of growth. And so we had a lot of resources dedicated to running those operations. And they just -- they just weren't important geographies. For us we also had some services that we had been experimenting with, if you will, that we came to the conclusion that we had better opportunities to grow other segments of the business. So these are the areas that we sold. It wasn't really material. Total revenue run rate was about $50 million annually. So I don't think that it's going to have a -- any short-term, mid-term, long-term impact on our run rate. Toni Kaplan : That's helpful. And this was asked in a different way already, but just want to make sure I understand the comments that you've made today sound like things are doing fine, improving in many cases, but there have been some new lockdowns and potential for more. So that's your reservation for not providing the 3Q guidance. Just Is that fair and what do you see directionally, I guess, as the range of revenue growth scenarios, is it better than 4Q on the downside, but better than this quarter on the upside, like just trying to understand how you're viewing the range. And obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty. So not trying to nail you down on it, just what's the upside and downside? Thanks. Scott Farmer : Yes, let me try to explain it this way. We're in a -- I think that it's the timing of our quarter, and therefore this call that are causing part of the problem. There's so much uncertainty right now, as we look out over the next several weeks, a couple of months, few months, maybe. And it's everything from the rising counts of the virus, we have government's putting more restrictions in place. And as of today, I don't know whether more government -- governors and mayors are going to do that, whether they're not going to do that, how long those restrictions are going to stay in place based on the ones that have put these things in place so far. We have a typical period between Christmas and New Year's where traditionally we have a group of customers close down their facilities for the holidays anyway. We don't know this year, whether that means they're going to extend that or not. And so that causes a little bit of cloudiness. We've got an election in Georgia coming up in a few weeks, that will determine what happens in the Senate. And so there's a lot of uncertainty. When we sat down and talked about it, we said, well, let's put a range together. But when we started to put a range together, we started saying, What if this happens? And what if that happens? And those would be things like, what if? What if a governor or a group of governors decided? Well, the vaccine is 3 months away, let's leave these restrictions in place for the next 3 months. What does that do to our ability to predict what our low end of the range might be? What if that doesn't happen? What if Governor Newsom actually does open California's economy backup January 4th. So it became such a wide range that we decided it didn't make sense for you. Our impression of -- and I don't want to, I hope you take this the right way. But our impression is that what one of the things that you like about our company is that we're pretty predictable. And when we give guidance, you can pretty much determine, in your models, what that means relative to what you think is going to happen. In this particular case, we don't think that what we would provide for you would allow you to do that, that you might wind up with some big swings with depending on your positive or negative approach, depending on what you think is going to happen in the economy. And therefore, we decided it didn't make sense for us in this period of time to do that. I do not believe this is my personal opinion, that it will be anything near like what happened in the fourth quarter for us, that was brand new. And I think there were 38 states that put shelter-in-place, orders in place in a short period of time. We haven't seen that. I don't think, I don't expect that that's going to happen at this point. It moving forward, might it maybe my personal opinion is that won't happen. Therefore, I don't see that as the eventual downside of what's going to happen. The upside could be that the number of cases begin to subside, that the mayors and governors begin to open. Their economies back up in anticipation of vaccinated progress, and so forth. But I do know this, with the vaccines rolling out that I can't predict the rate yet, I need a better understanding of what that is going to be. But with those vaccines rolling out, fewer and fewer governments are going to put restrictive orders in place. And eventually those economies and those states and municipalities are going to begin to recover at a pretty good rate. Is that in our fourth quarter? I'd love to see that. Is it next summer, highly likely that by next summer, some point next summer, we're going to be at that position. But that that's my -- that's my view of it, and so I'll end with that. Operator : We'll take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Scott Farmer : Shlomo, you may be on mute. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Sorry, I\u2019m on mute. Thank you. Thank you for calling that out. I just have a few. It's been great, yes, great color over here. Thank you. And I had a few housekeeping items that I thought we could just kind of run through maybe will be helpful. Just on some of the -- can you give more detail on kind of the one-time sales moving to subscription sales, or is there some way you can just get into a little bit more about how that impact might have happened in the quarter? And kind of the success that you're having over there? Is this something that, it's kind of a little bit more of a permanent lift that's over there. And then a couple more after that. Todd Schneider : Shlomo, this is Todd. We mentioned in our most recent quarterly release that, customers when they buy large orders of PPE, whether it's a government school system, could be health care could be -- up and down the street business, but they tend to make a large pie. And then they go into maintenance mode from there. And some of these large fines were in our Q1. Mike Hansen : There were some in Q2, some or some of those that bought in Q1 are now in maintenance mode and weren't Q2. So it's a real mix and trying to predict for those folks, how long they're going to need those products and services, the access to them is it's a dynamic marketplace. So, again, that's why we're very good, why we, we've invested for our customers in these inventory levels to help them with that. So hopefully that gives you a little bit more color. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And then, Hey, Mike, this is for you, I knew you were really good with numbers, but I'm still trying to figure out how you got an 18 million get dollar gain pre-tax on 108 million shares to be $0.025 of VPS that trigger some other kind of, tax benefit or something with that gain of sale. Todd Schneider : It's a great question, Shlomo. It did, yes, the assets had a high tax basis and created while a book gain, a tax loss and so you can kind of think of it as the $18 million pre-tax gain was about a $0.12 benefit. And the tax benefit was about a $0.013 benefit. And maybe said a little bit differently, the 13.3% tax rate was benefited by about 270 basis points. I'm sorry -- 370 basis points from this -- these transactions. And the remainder of that tax rate, call it 17%. Without that benefit, did have some benefit from equity compensation, as we've talked about in the past. As you think about that tax rate moving forward, I would suggest in the third quarter, think about a range of 20% to 21%. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Adler, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Paul Adler : Well, thank you, everyone for joining us. We will issue our third quarter of fiscal '21 financial results in late March. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Good day. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic continues,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :13:00 2021 ] and it remains a significant disruption to the economy. Our fiscal third quarter,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :14:00 2021 ] which included the months of December, January,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :14:00 2021 ] and February was particularly challenging. COVID-19 case counts surged from about 180,000 on December 1 to a peak of little over 300,000 on January 8. Not surprisingly, economic indicators reflected an economic recovery that slowed considerably. In December, the U.S. economy posted job losses again after seven straight months of job gains. The operating environment was also challenged by severe winter weather. The snow and ice storm in February caused extensive energy blackouts in the U.S., especially in the state of Texas. Despite a very difficult operating environment in late December and into January, our sales rep productivity remained strong and our employee partners persevered enabling us to offset the headwinds and get to flat on a sequential basis. On top of that, we were able to help our customers with large supplies of personal protective equipment before the end of the quarter. We provided more personal protective equipment than ever, enabling us to exceed our financial expectations. Also, on an organic basis, our quarterly revenue was flat year-over-year, a strong accomplishment considering the comparison to the prior year quarter that was not impacted by COVID-19. Looking ahead to our fourth quarter, we expect lower COVID-19 case counts to be the foundation for improved operating environment. We do not anticipate that personal protective equipment sales will be as strong, so fourth quarter revenue in this product line will decline sequentially. However, we believe that our recurring revenue service -- service revenue will increase solidly on a sequential basis after being flat in the third quarter. Mike will provide more information regarding our fourth quarter guidance soon. Regardless of the operating environment, our employee partners worked with urgency to get businesses ready for the workday[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :30:00 2021  ]Ready for the Workday[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :30:00 2021 ].

Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mike for commentary on our financial results. Mike? Mike Hansen : Thank you, Scott. Our fiscal 2021 third quarter revenue was $1.78 billion compared to $1.81 billion in last year's third quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS were $2.37, an increase of 9.7% from last year's third quarter. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and differences in the number of workdays was flat for the third quarter of fiscal '21. Organic revenue for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was also flat. Organic revenue for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment increased 17.7%. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal '21 was $809.5 million compared to $824.4 million in last year's third quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased 10 basis points to 45.6% for the third quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 45.5% in the third quarter of fiscal '20. This increase was despite one less workday in this year's third quarter compared to last year. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 27.2% in the third quarter of fiscal '21 and 28.2% last year. Fiscal '21 third quarter results benefited from increased sales rep productivity and lower discretionary spending. Operating income for the third quarter of fiscal '21 of $326.5 million increased 3.8%. Operating margin increased 100 basis points to 18.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 17.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '20. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '21 was 14.4% compared to 18.9% last year. The tax rate can move from period-[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :34:00 2021  ] [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :34:00 2021 ]to-[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :34:00 2021  ] [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :34:00 2021 ]period based on discrete events,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :34:00 2021 ] including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '21 was $258.4 million, an increase of 10.2%. And again, EPS was $2.37, an increase of 9.7% from last year's third quarter. Our balance sheet and cash flow remained strong. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6x debt to EBITDA. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. During the third quarter of fiscal '21, we purchased $82 million of Cintas' common stock under our buyback programs. Earlier this week,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :35:00 2021  ] on March 15, Cintas paid shareholders $79.5 million in quarterly dividends. For financial modeling purposes, please note that there is one more workday in our fiscal '21 than in our fiscal '20. One more workday will benefit fiscal '21 full revenue growth by 40 basis points. One more workday also benefits operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '21 operating margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20 due to one more day of revenue. In fiscal '20, the fourth quarter contained 65 workdays. This fiscal year's fourth quarter contains 66. Please keep these differences in mind when modeling results on a[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :36:00 2021 ] [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :36:00 2021 ]year-over-year and sequential basis. For our fourth quarter, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.83 billion,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :36:00 2021 ] and diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.40. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 21% to 22.5%. Please note that our guidance does not include any future share buybacks or additional government restrictions on businesses in the event of increasing COVID-19 cases. We are encouraged by vaccinations, stimulus,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :37:00 2021 ] and business reopenings,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :37:00 2021 ] and we expect an improved operating environment in our fourth quarter. We expect recurring revenue to increase solidly on a day adjusted sequential basis in the range of about 1% to 2.5%, after being flat in the third quarter. However, we do not anticipate that personal protective equipment sales will remain at record levels, so fourth quarter revenue in this product line will decline sequentially. Please keep in mind these points when comparing our fourth quarter guidance to third quarter results. Our fiscal fourth quarter marks the lapping of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our prior year fourth quarter coincided with a period of greatest GDP decline and job losses resulting from unprecedented restrictions on businesses to help combat the surge of COVID-19 cases. While the pandemic continues, our fourth quarter financial results, including revenue growth will benefit in part from an easier comparison. Our last year's fourth quarter operating income was also significantly affected by many items caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus. These included additional reserves on accounts receivable and inventory, severance and asset impairment expenses,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :39:00 2021 ] and lower incentive compensation expense. Excluding these items, last year's fourth quarter operating margin was 15.5%. All these items were recorded in selling and administrative expense. The additional inventory reserves account for slow moving inventory mostly in the Uniform Direct S[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :39:00 2021 ]s[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :39:00 2021  ]ale business, where customers and some of the most severely impacted industries such as airlines and hotels exist. Please keep these points in mind when comparing our fiscal fourth quarter financial guidance to the prior year quarter. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Todd Schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses. Todd Schneider : Thanks, Mike. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :40:00 2021  ]care scrubs, mats,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :40:00 2021 ] and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.42 billion compared to $1.45 billion last year. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin increased 50 basis points to 46.3% for the third quarter compared to 45.8% in last year's third quarter, driven in large part to lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :41:00 2021 ] and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $198.5 million compared to $170.5 million last year. The First Aid segment gross margin was 43.5% in the third quarter compared to 48.0% in last year's third quarter. The difference in gross margin is due to revenue mix. In the pandemic, the needs of businesses for personal protective equipment, including masks and gloves has skyrocketed. Even though personal protective equipment is a less predictable revenue stream with lower gross margins than the relatively consistent first aid cabinet service, personal protective equipment is a profitable product line,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :43:00 2021 ] and we continue to work with urgency to fulfill the needs of businesses. Also note that on a sequential basis, First Aid segment gross margins and operating margins have improved through the pandemic. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $160.7 million compared to $192.1 million last year. The Fire business,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :43:00 2021  ] organic revenue increased 3.5%, the Uniform Direct Sale business organic revenue growth rate was minus 39.7%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :44:00 2021 ] and gaming customers are largely realized within this business line. These industries continue to be among the hardest hit by the pandemic. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions. Operator : Thank you sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Tim Mulrooney : Good morning, Scott, Todd, Mike, and Paul. My question, I just have one for you this morning on the Uniform Rental segment. Operating margins in this business have ticked up nicely in 2021, and I think some of that was from structural cost savings,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :45:00 2021  ] and may [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :45:00 2021 ]be some from temporary cost savings. Moving forward, would you expect uniform operating margins to kind of normalize towards that pre-pandemic run rate over time or would you expect t[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :45:00 2021 ]h[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :45:00 2021 ]e [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :45:00 2021 ]operating margins to kind of settle at a [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :45:00 2021 ]somewhat higher level than the pre-pandemic run rate? Thank you. Scott Farmer : Well, Tim, this is Scott. I\u2019[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :46:00 2021 ]d[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :46:00 2021 ] will [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :46:00 2021  ]start by saying that there have been a lot of expenses this year that we have been able to control tightly, discretionary spending, travel, things like that, that impact the P&L. How much of that returns, I'm not sure. I mean, we wanted an awful lot, we don't necessarily have to have the large group meetings where everybody is travel[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :46:00 2021  ]ling into one town to accomplish that. Some of that will happen, but [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :46:00 2021 ]. But [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :47:00 2021  ]a lot of that probably won't. But I'd say that in our sequential -- in our recurring revenue businesses, as the economy continues to, I think, improve, you're going to see us need to add some expense back on to the P&L. That might be growth routes in the rental division as an example. Jobs that would help us with growth, additional salespeople, sales training, additional headcount in t[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :47:00 2021 ]he [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :48:00 2021 ]production operations to be able to process things. So, I wouldn't expect a linear improvement, but I would tell you that we do think that we will continue to see 20% to 30% incremental margins,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :48:00 2021  ] as we add the sales line back on to the P&L, and over time I think that we can maintain margins that will be at least at or above, probably above where we work [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :48:00 2021  ]were [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :48:00 2021 ]pre-pandemic, so that's how I would answer that. Does that help you? Tim Mulrooney : That's really helpful, honest[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :49:00 2021 ]. Honest[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :49:00 2021  ], thoughtful answer. I appreciate that. Scott, thanks for taking my question. Scott Farmer : Okay. Thanks, Tim. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with J.P. Morgan. Andrew Steinerman : Hi, there. A question for Todd. When you think of rentals being flat in the just reported quarter, could you just give us a sense of, you know,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :50:00 2021 ] how much ancillary services is contributing versus are you seeing improvement in Uniform Rentals as well? And a quick comment on how dependent are you in some of the areas like restaurants that are still kind of opening up ahead? Todd Schneider : Andrew, great question. We had -- as was mentioned in the prepared remarks, demand for various items around PP&E and et cetera, other items regarding the pandemic was very strong in Q3. That was a result of what was going on with case counts, and you all saw that. So, that was significant for us to the tune of about $45 million more than in Q2. We don't see that as repeating -- that level repeating in Q4, but But [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :51:00 2021  ]we are very encouraged by what we're seeing in business coming back. So, you can see in our sequential improvement, what we see coming in Q4 over Q3, even without that level, that elevated level of those types of products and services. As far as restaurants, et [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :51:00 2021 ]cetera, that's certainly a component of our business. We are encouraged by what we're seeing there with folks\u2019[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :52:00 2021  ] activity increasing, consumer spending increasing. We think people having money in their pockets via stimulus will help that, and we sure hope that small business folks who have been incredible about weathering the storm, that their demand starts to pick up even more. So, we're encouraged by what we see. Andrew Steinerman : Okay. Thank you. Scott Farmer : Andrew, if I could just add a point of clarification of the $45 million that Todd referred to, that is in the rental segment as well as the First Aid segment. You saw our First Aid segment had another very good quarter at 17.7%. And so,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :53:00 2021 ] we're seeing demand in all of these different kinds of things in -- from all of our customers, and we're doing our best to meet those demands. So,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :53:00 2021 ] it's -- that $45 million is not all within the rental segment, it's in all of our businesses. Andrew Steinerman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. If you exclude the $45 million in PPE lift in the Uniform Rentals business, could you perhaps talk about how revenue trends progressed moving through fiscal 3Q? Scott Farmer : Yes. George, but to Mike's point that $45 million was spread out across the -- [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :54:00 2021  ]all of our divisions, it wasn't just a rental lift, but relative to what happened in Q3, I think it's important that we all keep in mind that our third quarter often is a little less predictable than the rest of our year, and this [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :55:00 2021 ]. This [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :55:00 2021  ]year was as well. It has two holidays in it with Christmas and New Year and our customers sometimes take multiple days off depending on what days[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :55:00 2021 ] those holidays fall on. There's always a potential of weather issues with the [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :55:00 2021  ]snow and ice storms and things like that, and both of those things happened this year, and if you combine that with increasing COVID cases, it made it a little bit more complicated than it normally does. I would say as we went into the third quarter, we were very concerned about what we were seeing. COVID cases were on the rise. I\u2019ve said earlier in my remarks that the economy shed jobs for the first time in s[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :56:00 2021 ]even [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :56:00 2021 ]7 months in December. So, December and into January, really even into February, we saw a very difficult economic environment, but as we got into February, we started to see our recurring revenues[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :56:00 2021  ] start to pick back up. Cases were dropping dramatically from -- I want to say, maybe the second week in January, the expected restrictions, the [[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :57:00 2021 ]indi[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :57:00 2021 ]s[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :57:00 2021 ]c[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :58:00 2021 ]ernible[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :57:00 2021 ]][ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :57:00 2021 ] [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :57:00 2021 ]govern[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :57:00 2021  ]an[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :57:00 2021  ]ce [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :57:00 2021  ]that we thought were going to put on businesses didn't fully materialize. And so, the -- [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :58:00 2021  ]we built some momentum in February that we continued[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 07 :58:00 2021 ] to see as we moved into March, and I think that is reflected in the guidance that we've given for the fourth quarter. George Tong : Got it. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up to that, if you look at new business trends and plans for sales force hiring, can you talk a little bit about how the pipeline is building? Scott Farmer : We're very pleased with our pipeline. Our sales rep productivity continues to be at very, very high levels. We believe that the -- our value proposition is resonating today in the economy more than ever. So we're excited about our opportunities as we look out into the future.

So,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :00:00 2021 ] we're -- the pipeline is relatively full,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :00:00 2021 ] and the reps are performing at high levels, even considering the fact that many times they're making sales calls over a virtual Teams [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :00:00 2021 ]teams [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :00:00 2021  ]call or Zoom call and being successful in doing it. So,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :00:00 2021 ] we're excited about getting past this pandemic and getting into a normal economy. We think we'll be -- we are well-[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :01:00 2021  ] [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :01:00 2021 ]positioned to take advantage of that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Hamzah Mazari : Hey, good morning. My question is a little bit more big picture. Pre-COVID, I guess your long-term growth rate was sort of 6% to 8% depending on the year. In a post-COVID world, and you touched on a little bit of this with some of the ancillary services that may be benefited from the pandemic,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :01:00 2021 ] which may normalize. But at the same time, you have these newer verticals you've penetrated, there's some structural outsourcing, maybe in health [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :01:00 2021  ]care that could be a tailwind. I don't know if that sort of plateaued out or it continues, so [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :02:00 2021 ]. So [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :02:00 2021  ]when you put all the puts and takes together in a post-COVID world, do you expect your growth rate to be better than what it was prior to the pandemic on a normalized basis,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :02:00 2021  ] as you look out over the next couple of years? Scott Farmer : Hamzah, that\u2019s tough for us to predict. I'm not sure that I'm going to go out and say that we're going to be doing better than we were from a percentage growth standpoint, post-pandemic and [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :02:00 2021  ]than [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :02:00 2021 ]we were pre-pandemic. But as I\u2019ve said, we really like where we're positioned. We've made a lot of investments in the business that we think are beginning to pay off, that allow us to move quicker to be a better supplier to customers. Our customer satisfaction rates that we measure with Net Promoter S[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :03:00 2021 ]s[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :03:00 2021  ]cores are at all-time highs, and [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :03:00 2021 ]. And [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :03:00 2021  ]we have opened up new segments of opportunity for us. We have new products and services that we can offer to more and more businesses. So,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :03:00 2021 ] I'll just answer that by saying, we think we're very well-[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :04:00 2021  ] [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :04:00 2021 ]positioned, and [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :04:00 2021 ]. And [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :04:00 2021  ]we're excited about the future. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. Todd Schneider : Hamzah, if I could -- this is Todd. Just to [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :04:00 2021 ]expand upon what Scott\u2019[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :04:00 2021 ]s[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :04:00 2021 ] is [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :04:00 2021  ]saying, the real unknown is what is going to happen with the demand for some of these additional services that we've been able to provide, here's what we know is that demand is going to be higher in the future than it was pre-pandemic. And what's exciting is, many of our customers didn't even realize that we offered[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :50:00 2021 ] those types of products and services in the past. Let me be clear, there's nothing positive that came out of the [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :51:00 2021 ]pandemic, right, but if there is any silver linings, it[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :51:00 2021 ] is the fact that our customers understand more the value that we can provide them, an[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :52:00 2021 ]d[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :52:00 2021 ] as [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :52:00 2021 ]. And [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :52:00 2021  ]Scott mentioned that our NPS scores are reflecting that. And we think that is a -- the more the products and services our customers procure from us, and [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :52:00 2021  ]the more value we're bringing to them, and we think that is very positive. The other item that I think is important to understand is that we're going on 2 years now without having had a price adjustment to our customers. We have felt very passionate that it was not the appropriate time to adjust pricing when people are going through so much difficulties fighting through [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :53:00 2021 ]for [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :53:00 2021  ]the pandemic. And as a result of that,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :53:00 2021 ] -- [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :53:00 2021  ]again,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :53:00 2021  ] our customers had [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :53:00 2021 ]did[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :53:00 2021  ] [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :53:00 2021  ]really appreciated that and truly positioned us well for the future. We look at the lifetime value of a customer and we think it is worth more than a short-term approach, so [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :53:00 2021 ]. So [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :53:00 2021  ]hopefully all that cover [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :53:00 2021  ]co[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :53:00 2021 ]lor [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :53:00 2021 ]helps. Hamzah Mazari : Yes, that's very helpful. And just my follow-up question and I'll turn it over. Just on the Fire business, I know it's a smaller business for you, but it's a good business. Could you maybe talk about how you're thinking about scaling that business up? And the reason I ask is, we look at the First Aid business and you did ZEE Medical in 2015,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :54:00 2021 ] and that business scaled up. Does Fire have the same potential in your mind,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :54:00 2021 ] and maybe if you could just talk about the competitive dynamic in that business.[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :54:00 2021 ]?[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :54:00 2021  ] Scott Farmer : Yes. The -- we do think the Fire business has an opportunity to scale up. There are lots and lots and lots of small independent players, there [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :55:00 2021 ]. There [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :55:00 2021  ]are regional players, there are some PE groups that are doing some regional roll-ups[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :55:00 2021 ]rollouts[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :55:00 2021  ]. So,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :55:00 2021 ] there are opportunities for us to make some acquisitions in that business that would help us ramp up scale and geographic coverage. It is a very good business. One of the things that is important to understand is that different states have different licensing requirements for the level of different reps that we have, service technicians that we've had out there performing different levels of service be it [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :55:00 2021 ]via [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :55:00 2021  ]fire extinguisher repair and replacement versus sprinkler systems and alarm systems. They [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :56:00 2021 ],[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :56:00 2021  ] they [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :56:00 2021  ]have different certification levels that they have to have. So,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :56:00 2021 ] it's different than just hiring somebody off of the street,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :56:00 2021 ] and us being able to train them to be a First Aid service rep. These people need to get state certifications and licensing and things like that. But that said, we like our ability to grow in the geographies that we're in. There's a lot of geography that we would like to expand into, and there are lots of opportunities for tuck-in acquisitions in the markets that we're in right now. So,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :56:00 2021 ] we really like that business. And I think over time, we can scale that up to be of size [[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :57:00 2021 ]ph[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :57:00 2021 ]][ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :57:00 2021 ]. I always tell the division presidents, including Fire and First Aid, that their job is to figure out how to get their division to be at least a $1 billion in revenue, and [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :57:00 2021 ]. And [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :57:00 2021  ]that's what they should be thinking about. And that helps us put goals in place and decide what type of resources we want to invest in the different businesses and so forth, bu[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :57:00 2021 ]t [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :57:00 2021 ]. But [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :57:00 2021  ]we clearly think that both First Aid and Fire divisions can be over a $1 billion in revenue for us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann with RW. Baird. Andrew Wittmann : Great, and thanks for taking my questions. I had one question and then a follow-up. I guess, on the -- the first question here maybe, Mike, over the years Cintas' growth has been fairly consistent in the characteristics that comprises between things like price and stocks and new accounts, even retention from \u2013[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :58:00 2021 ] to [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :58:00 2021 ]some extent. I mean, in normal times, we have a pretty good sense about how that contributes to your year-over-year growth rate. Now that the next few quarters are going to be driven more by a reopening-[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :59:00 2021 ] [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :59:00 2021  ]type growth rate, I was wondering if you talk about which of those factors you think will contribute more than their historical percentage to the growth and maybe less, just [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :59:00 2021 ]. Just [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :59:00 2021  ]to understand how you're thinking about how this matters and it [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 08 :59:00 2021 ]will unfold in the next few months or quarters. Scott Farmer : Yes, Andrew, it's been a -- it certainly has been a different environment operating in the last four quarters, and one that's been pretty unpredictable. I think what we'll see, what we've guided to in the fourth quarter and likely will get us off to a start in the first quarter of '22,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :00:00 2021  ] is the continued reopening of businesses and getting those businesses back to somewhat normalized operations. We were on a nice trajectory of that towards the end of our first quarter of [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :00:00 2021 ]this year and into our second quarter that certainly took a pause, but [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :00:00 2021 ]. But [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :00:00 2021  ]we've got a lot of customers that still are either not opened or at limited capacity. And so, I think as we look at the next couple o[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :00:00 2021 ]f [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :00:00 2021 ]quarters, maybe even the most of fiscal '22, it's going to be about fully reopening the economy and getting those -- getting our customers and other businesses back to healthy operating environments. That means we'll take businesses off of held [[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :01:00 2021 ]ph[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :01:00 2021 ]][ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :01:00 2021 ]a health [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :01:00 2021  ]status in the rental division. We'll start this [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :01:00 2021  ]to service First Aid cabinets again at a greater pace. We'll start to understand the needs,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :01:00 2021  ] when they open and come off of hold, how can we help them in this new type of environment with all of the things that we've talked about that have been important. So,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :02:00 2021 ] I think it's going to be more of that. The reopening of the economy and getting back to some normal type of process than anything else. Andrew Wittmann : That's helpful. Then just for [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :55:00 2021 ]from a [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :55:00 2021  ]follow-up, I wanted to just talk about inflation a little bit. There's been obviously a lot talked about and it seems like there's a lot of merit given the amount of stimulus that's going to be hitting the system here. [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :55:00 2021 ]It[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :56:00 2021 ]\u2019[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :56:00 2021 ]s[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :56:00 2021 ] -- its [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :56:00 2021  ]already hitting the system. So,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :56:00 2021 ] I was hoping, Mike, you could talk a little bit about where inflation could hit you, where you might be seeing it today or expect to see it tomorrow. Obvious, areas that [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :56:00 2021  ]come to mind like energy and be curious as to your thoughts and [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :56:00 2021  ]on [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :56:00 2021 ]how that impacts the outlook here for the calendar '21?[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :56:00 2021 ].[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :56:00 2021  ] But also, maybe even in some of the products that you're selling in the ancillary business and in First Aid, labor, obviously, if you could just address inflation, how you affect [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :57:00 2021  ]-- how you expect it [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :57:00 2021 ]to affect you and your ability to recover it in pricing against a [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :57:00 2021  ]recovering, but still not full bore macro. Thanks. Mike Hansen : Yes. So,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :57:00 2021 ] from a -- I'll say a short-term, we could certainly see changes in gas prices at the pump. We saw sequentially an increase in our energy percentage of about 10 basis points, and that certainly could contribute over the course of the next year. I think labor is certainly in the news and the conversations about wage rates is likely to have some impact on us as well as our customers. We could see, as you mentioned, certainly in some of the PPE, we have seen quite dramatic changes in prices, in costs to us in terms of gloves and masks and sanitizer over the course of the last year, and [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :58:00 2021 ]. And [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :58:00 2021  ]there's probably a little bit of that continued unpredictability in that kind of product. But, Andrew, the [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :58:00 2021  ]really good news and [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :58:00 2021  ]in [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :58:00 2021 ]all of that is we've got great efficiency in our business. And so, many times we're able to offset that with current initiatives that we have within the business. But if we can't, we certainly can look to pricing changes into the future. Todd mentioned, we have not liked that idea. In the last year, we did not think it's the right thing to do. But[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 09 :59:00 2021  ], and it's been 2 years really since we've done it. But if we see inflation peak, that's an opportunity that we will certainly have to consider. And usually in the past, that's allowed us to pass on a good portion of those kind of costs,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :20:00 2021  ] if we can't offset them within our operations. Todd Schneider : Andrew, it's Todd. Just to build upon that, everything Mike said is right on target. We're in a good position to withstand those adjustments based upon our model, our efficiencies that we can bring to market. But with all these, whether it's inflation in general,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :20:00 2021  ] or wage inflation specifically, our biggest concern is always the impact to our customers. We will manage our business, we will do it so appropriately. But if it affects our customer base, then that's a much greater concern. And we're hoping that the health of those smaller businesses has been tested, and [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :21:00 2021 ]. And [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :21:00 2021  ]we're in hopes that they can continue to expand and thrive in the new environment. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. Just wanted to ask about the SAP benefits that you are seeing just now that the integration within Rental has been completed. I know we're sort of in an[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :22:00 2021 ] unique period, but just wanted to see if any of those are coming through now or for [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :22:00 2021  ]we should be expecting it going forward,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :22:00 2021  ] just anecdotally any benefits from the SAP program. Thanks. Todd Schneider : Yes. Toni, this is Todd. We are seeing very nice efficiencies from having beyond for the most part one platform for the entire organization benefiting our customers in one view of Cintas. It's benefiting our locations in [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :22:00 2021  ]and[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :22:00 2021 ] [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :22:00 2021 ]the ability to share inventory, our distribution centers in order to be able to anticipate needs. It's been quite impactful and a lot of positive things that have come out of having that one platform and the efficiencies that come along with it both for the customer, but also internally have been very encouraging. Toni Kaplan : Great. I wanted to also ask about capital allocation. If we hit a period now where demand accelerates, do [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :23:00 2021 ]you expect to be investing more back into the business for organic growth opportunities or M&A, and [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :23:00 2021 ]. And [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :23:00 2021  ]I saw you\u2019re buying back some stock in the quarter. So,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :23:00 2021 ] does that get back to historical levels, just [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :23:00 2021 ]? Just [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :23:00 2021  ]what are you thinking about allocating capital? Scott Farmer : Well, if we start with CapEx, we're still sort of managing through the unpredictability of the economy. So,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :24:00 2021 ] we're probably a little more conservative right now and will be in the fourth quarter. But over time, I think our CapEx spend as the economy turns around and [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :24:00 2021  ]will [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :24:00 2021 ]get back to a more normalized historical type,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :24:00 2021 ] and that's typically roughly 60% based on growth and 40% on maintenance. So,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :24:00 2021 ] I think we'll continue to see that type of spend. We do generate a lot of cash. We've got a very strong balance sheet. And so,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :24:00 2021 ] we would be interested in acquisitions in all of our businesses. And then,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :25:00 2021  ] obviously, the dividend is important to our shareholders. We have continued to be in a position where we could increase the dividend to our shareholders every year since we went public, and obviously that is a streak that we'd like to see continue. And then, yes, finally, we do have roughly a [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :26:00 2021  ]$1 billion left on our authorization, and [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :26:00 2021 ]. And [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :26:00 2021  ]that is more sort of opportunistic from time-to-time as we see opportunities to acquire our own stock. And so, should we be in a position where we're building cash and we think the opportunity is right, I think that the Board would agree that we would be in a [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :26:00 2021 ]position to buy back some of our stock. You [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :26:00 2021  ]W[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :26:00 2021 ]e [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :26:00 2021 ]saw a little bit of that in the third quarter,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :26:00 2021  ] when the stock price went down. And so, it -- I think that I wouldn't be surprised to see that sort of thing in the future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America. Gary Bisbee : Hey, guys, good morning. It's impressive to get back to flat year-over-year same day sales, I guess, a quarter really before lapping the step down from the pandemic. I wanted to ask about mix within that sale. So, can you give us a sense of how meaningful PP&E sanitizers and other pandemic driven sales are to the current revenue levels? And so,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :27:00 2021 ] how much the more normal historical mix would still be down, right in Q3 without that? That's the first question. Scott Farmer : Well, let me start by saying that things like the hand sanitizer and some of the sanitation products and wipes that we have fit into a recurring revenue stream,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :28:00 2021  ] once we put this like the restroom supplies, once we put the stand out there,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :28:00 2021 ] we come in [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :28:00 2021  ]an[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :28:00 2021 ]d[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :28:00 2021 ] [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :28:00 2021 ]service and [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :28:00 2021  ]it [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :28:00 2021 ]on a regular basis, make sure they have enough product in there to make it through till their next delivery and so forth. So that is -- that becomes part of the recurring revenue stream. The other products, things like disposable gloves, disposable face masks,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :29:00 2021 ] and things like that are the one-time PPE sale, I[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :29:00 2021 ] refer to it as one time, but it's more of a direct sale that it can fluctuate up and down depending on customer needs. But we have -- a lot of it depends on geography, it depends on the industry that the customer is in, some distribution-[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :29:00 2021 ] [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :29:00 2021  ]type businesses they've increased headcount, increased number of wares, we -- other businesses have reduced the number of wares. So,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :29:00 2021 ] it's a little bit all over the board trying to put some parameter on that relative to historical average.[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :30:00 2021 ],[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :30:00 2021  ] I'd say recurring revenue with the understanding that some of that is now the result of hand sanitizer and that's where it is flat through the quarter. And we think that that revenue is going to pick up as the economy turns around, as our customers get back to being able to open their businesses more fully,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :30:00 2021 ] bring back some of their headcount, and [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :30:00 2021 ]. And [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :30:00 2021  ]I believe that an awful lot of the recurring business,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :31:00 2021 ] like hand sanitizer is here to stay. I have said in the past,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :31:00 2021 ] and I continue to believe that it's going to be a long time before a typical American walks into a business, walks into a restaurant, a lobby, a movie theate[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :31:00 2021 ]re[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :31:00 2021  ], any place and he isn't looking for a hand sanitizer station after they grabbed the doorknob going in and out of a public building. We're seeing that in stadiums, we're seeing that at -- in hotels that are open, at elevator stations, and that sort of thing[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :32:00 2021 ].[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :32:00 2021 ]that's where[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :32:00 2021  ] I think that's going to be here to stay. So,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :32:00 2021 ] if I'm right about that, as they bring back and open up their operations more fully, that will be revenue,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :32:00 2021  ] as they add people back on revenue on top of where they are right now. Todd Schneider : Gary, this is Todd. I think it's important to understand also the vast majority of the products and services we're speaking of, whether it's face shields, gloves, hand sanitizer, cleaning chemicals, all those, we have been offering those for decades. It's not new, right, it's just -- it's elevated. And we think it will be -- it will maybe not be at the current levels[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :33:00 2021  ], but [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :33:00 2021 ]. But [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :33:00 2021  ]it will remain elevated into the near and maybe distant future,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :33:00 2021  ] or in the near future certainly,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :33:00 2021  ] and maybe even [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :33:00 2021 ]much further out than that. So that's exciting for us. We see that -- again, our customers now see that much more of a value in it, in large part because people are much more focused on hygiene and cleanliness than they were in the past. And many of our customers, they cleaned for image, and [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :34:00 2021 ]. And [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :34:00 2021  ]now they are cleaning for help[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :34:00 2021  ]health[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :34:00 2021 ]. And that's very much a positive we think for society, but also makes our value proposition that much stronger to our customers. So,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :34:00 2021 ] some very positives coming out[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :34:00 2021  ]up[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :34:00 2021 ]. Gary Bisbee : And if I could just clarify one thing in that response. Scott, you said recurring revenues were flat. Did you mean sequentially versus Q2 or did you mean year-over-year? And if the latter, flat year-over-year, does that imply then that the one-time-ish PP&E sales increase year-over-year was similar to the Uniform Direct sales decrease, which would allow that to be flat? I just want to make sure I understood[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :37:00 2021 ]understand[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :37:00 2021  ] exactly what you're saying. Scott Farmer : I meant sequentially from the second quarter. Gary Bisbee : Got it? Okay. All right. I mean, what I'm trying to solve for is, how much the traditional businesses are down. I appreciate everything you're saying about this demand persists in the big uptick [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :38:00 2021 ]uptake and [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :38:00 2021  ]in sustainable recurring sanitizer sales, but [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :38:00 2021 ]. But [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :38:00 2021  ]in the traditional pre-pandemic business mix, I mean, is that still down 5% and it's offset by PP&E up 5% or directionally, can you help us understand it? What I'm really trying to solve[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :39:00 2021 ] [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :39:00 2021 ][[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :38:00 2021 ]ph[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :38:00 2021 ]][ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :38:00 2021 ]solve [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :38:00 2021  ]for is what's at risk of going away over 12 months, 18 months, as the traditional business mix obviously comes roaring back. Scott Farmer : Well, Gary, I think the -- probably the best way to describe it is, as we mentioned, in total for the company, it was up $45 million sequentially. We don't think that will repeat, but [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :39:00 2021 ]. But [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :39:00 2021  ]we do believe that these elevated levels, relatively elevated levels are here to stay. Mike Hansen : Yes, and Gary,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :39:00 2021 ] the -- to answer what's at risk, we're -- it's really premature. Scott talked a little bit about the enhanced value proposition of all of these things. And while we may see,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :40:00 2021 ] we have seen some ups and downs in terms of that product mix in the last three quarters. We don't expect that to go away overnight. This is not going to be a flip of the switch and the pandemic is over. And so,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :40:00 2021 ] we -- it's hard to say how much of this will continue in the future. Will the frequency of sanitizer spray services stay the same frequency as today? Will this [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :41:00 2021  ]the frequency of our ultra clean services stay the same as today? It's hard to tell. But what we fully expect is that this cleanliness idea and value is going to stick around for a while. And so, so [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :41:00 2021  ]trying to dissect the results by product category and other things, we're not going to get into that,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :42:00 2021  ] because it's too early to tell exactly what that future run rate is going to look like. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Great, thanks. I know you talked to kind of [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :42:00 2021 ]the severe weather holiday impact. Is there any way to think about how much the weather under [[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :42:00 2021 ]ph[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :42:00 2021 ]] [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :42:00 2021 ]the holiday and then the spike in COVID impacted the quarter? And I know it kind of varies across business lines, but [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :42:00 2021 ]. But [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :42:00 2021  ]just any thoughts as to how that impacted the quarter? Scott Farmer : Well, I guess, the easiest way to look at it would be that there was a dip from early December into January, and then revenue started to rebound as we got into February. February was better than January. And obviously, if you look at all that,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :58:00 2021 ] the quarter winds up being flat sequentially to the second quarter. So,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :58:00 2021 ] you can run that down and then dip back up. I would tell you that we do have some momentum as we go into the fourth quarter. And so,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :59:00 2021 ] we\u2019re -- we have a better expectation of economic conditions and [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :59:00 2021  ]in our business as we get into and through the fourth quarter. Kevin McVeigh : Got it. And then just is there any way to think about kind of across your client base, what percentage maybe you [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :59:00 2021  ]are engaged right now, or [[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :59:00 2021 ]indiscernible[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :59:00 2021 ]][ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :59:00 2021 ] [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :59:00 2021 ]not using [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 10 :59:00 2021  ]product or [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :00:00 2021  ]service versus where it was last quarter and where that's been historically. I know there's probably seasonality there, but I guess just trying to get a sense of how many clients maybe aren't fully active right now, but you expect to start coming back as the economy starts to reopen. Scott Farmer : So, Kevin, I think your question was what percent of our customers are on hold? So,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :00:00 2021 ] we have, we had a -- as Mike mentioned, I believe,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :01:00 2021  ] a strong run up in the summer and into the fall, [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :01:00 2021 ]some never came back, some of them went on hold. So,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :01:00 2021 ] it's a little difficult to give me [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :01:00 2021  ]you [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :01:00 2021 ]an exact number on that. But I can tell you th[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :01:00 2021  ]at[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :01:00 2021  ] [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :01:00 2021  ]t[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :01:00 2021 ]his, [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :01:00 2021 ]we're anxious for those folks to get back. We think that there is an incredible amount of pent up demand that is in the marketplace, you had that with stimulus checks, and [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :02:00 2021 ]. And [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :02:00 2021  ]we think consumer spending could spike quite strongly in the Q3, Q4 calendar years -- of the calendar year. And we think that'll be really positive. If you put that together with the strong value proposition that we have increasingly, the strong value proposition that we have with our customers, meaning that when they come back, they still have to provide confidence to their employees and their customers, their clients, that they're coming back to a safe environment. And so,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :03:00 2021 ] we think all that combined is going to make for a [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :03:00 2021  ]quite a good situation. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. Good morning. Somewhat following up on that last question from Kevin. On [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :03:00 2021 ],[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :03:00 2021  ] [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :03:00 2021  ]specifically in [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :03:00 2021  ]your airline cruise line hospitality, the travel segment, can you put any quantification on how much those are down,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :03:00 2021 ] and more importantly,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :03:00 2021  ] maybe just a feel for if you've seen any improvement on those metrics since the trough or [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :04:00 2021 ]? Or [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :04:00 2021  ]if we're still there? And then I will take away from the answer that [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :04:00 2021  ]to [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :04:00 2021 ]last question that, that[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :04:00 2021 ] is one of the categories that you think in the back half of this calendar year could significantly open up. Scott Farmer : To begin with, most of those -- [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :04:00 2021 ]the revenue from those customers is in our direct sale business,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :04:00 2021 ] [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :04:00 2021 ]a[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :04:00 2021 ]nd [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :04:00 2021 ]. And [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :04:00 2021  ]that business is down about 40% over prior year, and [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :04:00 2021 ]. [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :04:00 2021  ]An[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :04:00 2021  ]d [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :04:00 2021  ]as you analyze that, it's a little different depending on which segment you're talking about. For example, a lot of cruise ships are still at port, so the cruise line business has really been affected. There is some travel happening now,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :05:00 2021 ] particularly sort of vacation travel. So,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :05:00 2021 ] the hotels are doing a little bit better, the airlines are starting to pick up. When I say that, I mean they are [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :05:00 2021 ]their [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :05:00 2021  ]revenue streams to -- within their own business. We had seen a little bit of improvement from our revenue to those customers. And -- but still down 40% is a [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :06:00 2021 ]pretty significant number, and [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :06:00 2021 ]. And [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :06:00 2021  ]I think that the [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :06:00 2021  ]those businesses will have some form of recovery as the vaccines continue to roll out and people begin to feel safer travell[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :06:00 2021  ]ing. I haven't been to the vacation spots in Florida, but I understand that the spring break crowd is maybe not as big as normal, but they're down there right now. So,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :06:00 2021 ] I think there was a -- as Todd said, a pent up demand for people to be able to go and do things again, vacation again, go get on an [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :07:00 2021 ]airplane and go visit family in a different state across the country, that sort of thing. And I think that the big, the big[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :07:00 2021 ] trigger for all that and when that all happens is how soon a good portion of the U.S population has a vaccine. How long would [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :07:00 2021  ]will [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :07:00 2021 ]it take to get back to pre-COVID? That I don't know, it[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :07:00 2021 ] might take a couple of years, but [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :07:00 2021 ]. But [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :07:00 2021  ]I definitely could see that there would be some improvement in the second half of the year if the pace of vaccines continues at the rate that it is right now. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks for that, Scott. My follow-[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :08:00 2021  ] [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :08:00 2021 ]up is, you mentioned earlier it's been 2 [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :08:00 2021  ]two [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :08:00 2021 ]years since any change in pricing as a customer appreciation type strategy. I'm curious, as we move into the next fiscal year, what is -- might we see that start to happen? Would it be only in specific areas that are seemingly overdue and necessary to cover inflation or [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :08:00 2021 ]? Or [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :08:00 2021  ]is that a strategy you'll continue to maintain? What would it take, I guess, is a question for you to start to get a little bit assertive with pricing. Thanks. Scott Farmer : Scott, thanks for that question. First of all, it's important that you understand that it's not so much that we do it as a [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :09:00 2021  ]sort of a favor to the customer, but [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :09:00 2021 ]. But [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :09:00 2021  ]from our perspective, we want our customers to survive this pandemic,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :09:00 2021 ] and we were doing all kinds of things to help them out in that regard. They needed to add things,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :10:00 2021  ] depending on the customer-by-customer basis. But a small business might need to add hand sanitizers and masks and gloves and things from us, but they can't afford all of that. So,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :10:00 2021 ] we help them with adjustments on their invoices. Maybe their entrance mats[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :10:00 2021 ]match[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :10:00 2021  ] [ph[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :10:00 2021  ]] went from a weekly service to a biweekly or monthly service at a lower rate to help them afford what was happening. And it's [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :10:00 2021  ]to us, it's the relationship that we have with the[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :10:00 2021 ]a[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :10:00 2021  ] customer. We believe, we enhanced[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :11:00 2021 ] their image of us and their opinion of what type of a provider we are during these types[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :11:00 2021 ] of unfortunate situations. It was similar in the great recession. We had the experience of doing things then as well,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :11:00 2021 ] and the lifetime value of customers[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :11:00 2021 ]'s[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :11:00 2021  ] we come out of this is significant. They like us, they're willing to -- if they trust us, they're more willing to hear what we have to offer them when we develop new products and services. They're more willing to try those new products and services because of the relationship that we have with them and so forth,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :12:00 2021  ] and are less likely we think to listen to a competitor's offer, and [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :12:00 2021 ]. And [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :12:00 2021  ]that all goes into what we would use to [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :12:00 2021  ]and [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :12:00 2021 ]make our general calculations about the lifetime value of that customer. So, from a price standpoint, yes, we're coming [[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :12:00 2021 ]ind[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :12:00 2021 ]iscernibl[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :12:00 2021 ]e[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :12:00 2021 ]][ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :12:00 2021 ]up on[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :12:00 2021  ] 2 years since we last increased, generally speaking last increased our prices on our recurring revenue,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :13:00 2021 ] and that's particularly in the Rental division where that's probably a stronger statement and more relative to the Rental division than others. But we have seen competitors\u2019[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :13:00 2021 ] typical environment, pricing environment in our business,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :13:00 2021 ] and is that when they're trying to take our business, they offer ridiculously low prices to try to get our customers\u2019[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :14:00 2021 ] attention. But the way they treat their customers is that they're willing to raise prices to help protect their -- our competitors bottom line as opposed to help protect the customer. We've seen that in various places in the competitive environment in the last couple of years. We will look at it in the future on a customer-by-customer basis, what type of products and services they need. We -- if we are seeing price increases across the board, we'll have to -- in our own supply chain, we'll have to figure out the right way to pass some of those costs on to our customers. But the fact that we haven't done it in the last couple of years puts us in a pretty darn good position when we sit down to talk to him [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :15:00 2021  ]them[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :15:00 2021 ] [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :15:00 2021 ]about the fact that it's time for us to have some price adjustments. And generally speaking, I think that those conversations are going to go well. Will that happen in the near future? That I can't tell you. I won't -- I can't tell you yet. A lot of it depends on how economic conditions continue to recover. At[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :15:00 2021 ] at [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :15:00 2021  ]the pace that we're on right now,[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :15:00 2021 ].[ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :15:00 2021  ] I would assume that between that the potential for energy prices to increase, the potential for inflation to increase, we're eventually going to have to adjust our prices and that will [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :16:00 2021 ]that'll [ Author ID1 : at Thu Jun 3 11 :16:00 2021  ]happen. When? I'm not ready to predict. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Q&A. I would now like to turn the call back over to Paul Adler for closing remarks. Paul Adler : Thank you, Katie, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. We will issue our fourth quarter of fiscal '21 financial results in July.

Operating margin increased 660 basis points to 19.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 12.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Fiscal '20 fourth quarter operating income was affected by many items caused by COVID-19 including additional reserves on accounts receivable and inventory, severance and asset impairment expenses and lower incentive compensation expense. Excluding these items, the fiscal '20 fourth quarter operating margin was 15.5%, all of these items were recorded in last year's selling and administrative expenses. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 was 19.4% compared to 20.4% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the impact of stock compensation. Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 was $267.7 million, an increase of 85.2%. EPS was $2.47, an increase of 83% from last year's fourth quarter. Our balance sheet and cash flow remained strong. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.5 times debt-to-EBITDA at May 31st, 2021. On June 1st, 2021, $250 million of debt bearing an interest rate of 4.3% matured and was repaid with cash on hand. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. During the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 and our first quarter of fiscal '22 to date, we purchased $979 million of Cintas common stock under our buyback program. On June 15th, 2021, Cintas paid shareholders $79.2 million in quarterly dividends. For the fiscal year ended May 31st, 2021, revenue was $7.12 billion compared to $7.09 billion for fiscal '20. EPS for fiscal '21 were $10.24 compared to $8.11 for last fiscal year. Revenue and adjusted EPS have grown 50 of the past 52 years. Fiscal '21 free cash flow, which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures was $1.22 billion, an increase of 14.7% compared to last year. For our fiscal '22, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $7.53 billion to $7.63 billion and diluted EPS to be in the range of $10.35 to $10.75. Please note the following regarding our guidance. Our fiscal '22 effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 19.5% to 20.5% compared to a rate of 13.7% in fiscal '21. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '22 EPS guidance by about $0.85 and EPS growth by about 800 basis points. Guidance does not include any future share buybacks or potential tax reform. We remain in a dynamic environment that can continue to change. Our guidance contemplates a steadily improving economy, absent any economic or pandemic related setbacks. For financial modeling purposes, please note that there are no workday differences when comparing fiscal '22 to '21. Both fiscal years contained 66 days in the first quarter, 65 in the second, 64 in the third and 66 in the fourth quarter. I'll now turn the call to Paul for commentary on the performance of each of our businesses. Paul Adler : Thanks, Mike. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health care scrubs, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.47 billion compared to $1.27 billion last year. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin increased 410 basis points to 47.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 43.6% in last year's fourth quarter, driven in large part by lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue. While some inflationary pressures increased certain costs, these were more than offset by increased revenue from businesses re-opening or increasing capacity as COVID-19 case counts fell and restrictions on businesses were reduced. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $186.9 million compared to $196.3 million last year. First Aid fourth quarter revenue was up against a very difficult comparison. In last year's fourth quarter, in response to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, personal protective equipment sales surged. Also, the first aid Cabinet Service business was not impacted until late in last year's fourth quarter when business restrictions became widespread. As a result, the division posted a 21.9% organic revenue growth rate in last year's fourth quarter. The First Aid segment gross margin was 43.0% in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year compared to 46.1% last year. The difference in gross margins is due to revenue mix. As we guided last quarter, less personal protective equipment was sold in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. However, as a percentage of total division revenue, personal protective equipment revenue was still a significant percentage, while profitable personal protective equipment revenue has lower gross margins than the first aid cabinet servicing business. We expect gross margins to improve sequentially as the cabinet servicing business continues to grow and gets closer to the pre-COVID percent of total division revenue. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $181.9 million compared to $152.3 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue increased 22.4%. Gross margin improved 70 basis points. Uniform Direct Sale business organic revenue growth rate was 6.2%, and gross margin increased 280 basis points. I'll now turn the call over to Todd for our final prepared remarks. Todd Schneider : Thanks, Paul. We are pleased with our fourth quarter financial results that conclude a fiscal year of significant accomplishments, including the following. We help keep our customers' place of business clean, safe and Ready for the Workday by providing essential products and services. We procured hard to find and potentially life saving items such as face masks and gloves, provided hygienically clean health care scrubs and isolation gowns and developed services, including hand sanitizer dispensing, sanitizing spray services and disinfecting wipes. Our Net Promoter Scores reached an all-time high because we consistently delivered for our customers by providing needed products and services and being flexible with service agreement terms during the pandemic. We were again named to the prestigious Fortune 500, climbing 31 spots to rank at number 410 on the 2021 list. It's an honor to be recognized among the most successful and respected companies. We allocated capital to improve shareholder return. We paid down debt, reducing interest expense. We increased the annual dividend 10.2% and changed from an annual dividend to a quarterly dividend to return cash to shareholders more timely. We've increased the dividend 37 consecutive years. Also in fiscal 2021 and up until today, we repurchased 2.7 million shares of Cintas stock for a total of $979 million. As part of our steadfast commitment to corporate responsibility, we issued our inaugural environmental, social and governance, or ESG report. We are committed to protecting the environment, enhancing humanity and supporting the communities where we do business. And in addition to these many accomplishments and despite the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, we grew our fiscal year revenue and adjusted EPS. I can't thank our employee partners enough, and I'm so proud of their truly impressive achievements. The Cintas story is one of growth. We have grown revenue and adjusted EPS in 50 of the past 52 years. The only exceptions were the Great Recession years. Our successful long-term financial formula is organic revenue growth in the mid to high single digits, double-digit earnings per share growth, significant cash generation, improved deployment of excess cash to further generate strong shareholder returns. Our prospects for continued growth are great and a result in part from a strong value proposition and a vast total addressable market. We have a product or service to help nearly every business get Ready for the Workday. Examples include, scrubber rental to hospitals and dentists, hygiene supplies and services to professional services firms, floor care services, including walk-off mats and mops to retailers, first aid products to hotel and restaurant kitchens for cuts and burns, fire protection services to facilities managers and universities, and personal protective equipment to city maintenance and sanitation departments. The renting of health care scrubs and isolation gowns is indicative of a broad uniform rental opportunity. Plus, we are so much more than a uniform company. More than half of our revenue is from facility services, including hygiene, floor care items such as walk-off mats and dust mops, cleaning tools like microfiber mops and towels, first aid cabinet services, personal protective equipment, and fire protection services, including test and inspection of extinguishers and alarms. Our total addressable market is the 15 to 20 million businesses we don't currently service. Every business, goods producing or services providing has a need for image, safety, cleanliness or compliance. Every business has a need Cintas can fulfill. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic ushered in a greater focus on health, readiness and outsourcing of non-core activities. Significant opportunities for new revenues continue to exist because of the need of businesses to instil confidence in their employees, customers, students, patients, et cetera, that they will remain healthy and safe. The new services we launched, including hand sanitizer stand dispenser service and sanitizing spray service, have a long runway. Cintas consistently invest in technology to support growth. Our recent implementation of the SAP enterprise resource planning system provides benefits in three main areas. One is operational efficiencies. Our route drivers utilize personal route computers, which are similar to a cell phone, to access data and process transactions real time. Also, SAP enabled us to have visibility to laundered plant stock room [ph] inventories across our operations, helping improve profitability via the sharing and reuse of revenue producing assets. And the technology helps us improve working capital, be it tighter management of supply chain inventory. A second benefit is data analytics and enhanced business reporting. These result from having the order to cash cycle all in one system. SAP enables us to analyze, process and extract information from extremely large data sets, helping us target penetration, cross selling and pricing opportunities. And the third competitive advantage is improved customer service. Through SAP, our customers can pay bills and communicate with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We expect the ease of doing business will help us improve customer retention. Also, customers can order products and services via SAP, resulting in improved turnaround time and faster realization of product and service revenue. I want to say a few more words regarding ESG. From the start of our company in the Great Depression, the Cintas business model was wholly based on sustainable practices, wash and reuse. We have a great corporate responsibility story to tell. We will continue to expand our ESG reporting and are excited about issuing our next report this year. And finally, I'd like to say thank you on behalf of all Cintas employee partners to Scott Farmer for his 18 years of service as Chief Executive Officer. Under Scott's leadership, the company's revenue grew from $2.69 billion in 2003 to $7.12 billion in fiscal 2021. Scott successfully led Cintas through years filled with challenges, changes and opportunities, including the Great Recession, our largest acquisition, the COVID-19 pandemic and the integration of SAP technology across the organization. We thank Scott for his service to the company as CEO, and we are grateful that he remains as Executive Chairman. Scott Farmer : Thank you, Todd. And I'd like to take this moment to thank all of my Cintas partners across the company. I'm proud of our many collective accomplishments, including the innovative products and services that we provide our customers, as well as the tremendous dedication of our employee partners without whom we wouldn't be successful. Our company is in a position of financial strength with the strongest and most experienced management team that we've ever had executing a proven strategy that has allowed our continued success even through the recent pandemic. It's been a true honor and privilege for me to have led this company as CEO for the last 18 years. And I'm as excited about our future as I've ever been, and I look forward to watching this leadership team steer us to continued success in the future. Paul Adler : That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Andrew Wittmann with R.W. Baird. Please go ahead. Andrew Wittmann : Great. And thanks for taking my question. Scott, congratulations on a great run. It's been a pleasure, and we look forward to still having you associated maybe when we come to Cincinnati next time. Scott Farmer : You bet. Thank you. Andrew Wittmann : Yeah. So I guess getting on to business here a little bit, and maybe this is for Mike. There is been a lot of focus on inflationary factors. And what I heard here on your prepared remarks and in your release was that it sounds like you are getting good operating leverage. But I was just hoping you could drill in and talk about some of the key factors you've talked about in the past. Certainly, labor is one that's come up a lot broadly across the street. You've talked about some other things like health care, travel. And others are mentioning merchandise costs. I was just wondering if you could talk about some of those key buckets. And talk about the offsets that you have baked into guidance because it looks like your margin guidance is flat to up slightly. And so I was just kind of hoping you could talk about some of the moving pieces inside of that as to why you feel like you can offset some of these headwinds that might be creeping in? Mike Hansen : Sure. I'll begin, and certainly, Todd can jump in. But as it relates to guidance, you are right, Andrew. The implied margins would be at the low end of the guidance flattish to at the high end up around 70 basis points, so a pretty good range. And you know, you've heard us talk a lot about we've made some really great progress. We made some difficult decisions through this pandemic, and it'd be a shame to go backwards in this. And this guidance is suggesting that we don't intend to. And so how do we think about this inflation? Certainly, labor, as you mentioned, Andrew, is a big component of our cost structure. And the really good news for us is we've been working on the labor rates for some time, so this isn't something that is catching us by surprise. And over the last several years, we've been increasing the labor rates. And so certainly, the labor environment is a difficult one from the standpoint of the supply of people hiring has been a little bit more difficult. But we don't expect that the increasing wages around us is really going to be a significant issue. We've been working on that for years and don't expect that to really be that difficult for us as we move into the future. Scott Farmer : And I would add that, that includes last fiscal year. We raised the wage rates of all of our hourly people in our distribution centers, offices, production, all of our service, frontline service personnel. So we don't have a big catch up as a result of that. I know there are other businesses out there that froze wages in the pandemic. And because it was a year, they might have a catch up to make, and we don't have that. So you know, I'm happy to say that. But I don't think that so far we've seen issues where the labor rates are going to cause us significant problems. But we're more concerned about what happens to our customers as a result of this. And so we'll be watching that very closely. Todd Schneider : Andrew, this is Todd. It's a great question. We're in a good staffing position. We like where we are there. We like the fact that we've been addressing this subject over the course of a number of years. And as Scott pointed out appropriately, even in the peak of the pandemic last year, we were committed to staying the course and do the right things and taking care of our hourly partners to - because we knew that we could see things coming, right, and we're committed to it. So that's important to us. Certainly, other input costs are cost of goods. And our supply chain team is working harder than ever, and they are doing a great job in managing through that process to get us the goods that we need to make sure we're servicing our customers, which are doing a great job at, and to manage our cost structure from that standpoint. But we like the spot we're in, and we anticipate getting, hopefully some leverage on the additional revenue that we bring in. We've done such a great job and took such a big jump forward from fiscal '20 to fiscal '21 that as Mike stated, it will be a shame to go backwards, and we're focused on going forward. Mike Hansen : And Andrew, maybe I'll add a couple of other items. You saw that energy was 30 basis points higher in our fourth quarter than our third quarter, about 40 basis points year-over-year. We've built that kind of increase into our guidance. And certainly, there is room within our guidance for larger increases than that, but something that we'll keep our eye on. We are - we constantly are working on improving efficiencies, productivity levels, routing, and those things will all have positive impacts. From a material cost standpoint, you know, the good news is many of our rental items are amortized. So when we see increases in costs, they generally tend to take a long time to make it to our P&L, and they must - they have to last for a while so that they bleed in over time. And so, you know, obviously, we've got a great global supply chain Todd talked about, and they adapt. And so when we see inflationary pressures, we look for opportunities to adapt to that new environment. And I think, over the course of the last year, we've talked a lot about our supply chain. They've done a great job, and we anticipate that they will continue to do a very good job. Now having said that, you know, there are a lot of challenges in the supply chain and in hiring that we've talked about. And we're not immune to inflationary pressures. They are all built into our guidance. But the other thing is, we haven't increased our pricing for 2 years, right? And - but we certainly believe that, that is an opportunity for us. As we move into this new fiscal year, we have selectively started to do that in some areas. Pricing is local for us. It's customer by customer decision, and where we believe it makes sense, we will do that. And so that is certainly something that is available to us when we believe that the cost pressure is warranted. Again, all of that is built into our guidance, which assumes not just keeping the great leap forward that we made in fiscal '21, but even continuing to improve upon. Andrew Wittmann : That's really helpful. Thank you. I just - my one follow-up, is just trying to get a sense of the re-opening benefits that you are getting or expecting at a sequential basis. How much is left after the May quarter and into June? Is there still businesses that are closed for you or substantially closed where the revenues are so de minimis that they might as well be considered closed? Or on a sequential basis, are you starting to feel like things are fairly normal here, June, July time period? Thank you. Todd Schneider : So Andrew, Mike talked about pricing being a local subject, re-opening is a local subject as well. But for the most part, most businesses are back. Certainly, Canada has been a little slower to come back because of vaccination rates and government impacts there. But nevertheless, in general, most businesses are back. Now are they back at the levels that we think they will be in the future? No, and we're committed to helping them with our valuable products and services to help them be prepared as their employees come back and their customers come back, so that they can be - they can compete in the marketplace. So hopefully, that helps. Scott Farmer : Yeah. I would add, this is Scott. I would add that we think that Canada will be in the position that the US is sometime the end of the summer with re-openings, but they're on a steady pace heading in that direction. The biggest issue that we have is that businesses are open, but there are, what, about 7 million fewer people employed right now than they were pre-pandemic. And so there's a lot of room there. And I think as federal unemployment benefits subside in, what September, we hope to see that our customers that are open will be able to get themselves back to full staffing, and that will obviously benefit our business. Operator : Thank you. Moving on to our next question, we'll go to Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning, guys. So I was just hoping you could help us with the kind of cadence of organic growth by segment. There is still obviously a lot of uncertainty potentially out there, so thank you for giving full year guidance. But I was just hoping if there is anything to call out in terms of modeling you know, the growth rates of the segments? Todd Schneider : Yeah, Manav. this is Todd. So I think you've seen through our guidance, we expect a range of 5.8 to 7.2 from a growth rate. When you think about - obviously, the rental division is our, by far, our largest division, so that will be in that range. But we expect that all of our businesses, meaning the other businesses, Fire, First Aid and our Direct Sale business, will all be high single digit growth businesses in this fiscal year. So we feel very positive about all of them, and I look forward to growth in each of those businesses. Mike Hansen : Yeah. I think we might see a little bit of bumpiness in the First Aid business. You saw that their revenue was a little bit lower. Growth wise they had a decline in the fourth quarter. They had such a strong year last year, particularly in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. We may see a little bit of bumpiness through the year, but it's a great business. It's improving. We are seeing the recurring business and the mix start to turn back to where we like it. And so that's just throughout the year, maybe a little bit of a different performance than we're used to seeing from a steadiness perspective. Manav Patnaik : Okay. That makes sense. And then if I can just ask you know, around capital allocation, I mean the buyback was a pretty big number, the $900 plus million that you talked about. Can you just help us understand that in the context of the M&A pipeline and what we should expect going forward? Todd Schneider : Yeah. So our commitment is still number one priority is to invest back into our business, to grow the number of customers we have and grow those customers and invest in our infrastructure. Our second one is to invest in M&A. And we are very focused on M&A, active in that area and it's a big push for us. And then third, if there is - consistent with what our approach has been in the past, if there is capital that is in excess of that, then we'll return it back to the shareholders in the form of increasing dividend and repurchase of the stock as appropriate. Paul Adler : Yeah, Manav, this is Paul. And I was just wanted to add that, we're so fortunate to have such a strong balance sheet, the cash flow is so strong. We did that buyback, and our leverage is 1.5 times, as we mentioned in the script. So fortunate to be in a position where you know, what we do with the dividend and the buyback doesn't preclude us from M&A or any other activities because of the strength of the balance sheet. Manav Patnaik : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead. Andrew Steinerman : Hi. When you frame fiscal '22 revenue growth, could you just talk about some verticals here, which verticals do you think will be above the average growth of the guide? And which verticals might take longer to rebound or maybe they are just kind of slower growth verticals? Todd Schneider : So Andrew, this is Todd. As we look at the business, certainly, the hospitality business is - you read about it in the papers, right? You see - you hear about bookings, whether it's airlines or hotels, et cetera. That is a vertical that we think will be quite positive this year. The health care vertical is going to continue to be strong for us. Hospitals are catching up on voluntary type of procedures, which is helping that. And we have a very attractive value proposition in both of those areas as well. Education, government are both - we expect to be quite strong for us. There was a the mix of business, I think, you will see will be different in those areas, less PPE and more focused on more of a traditional type of approach that we've had in the past. But those key verticals are all positioned well. And if you think of them all, they are all positioned quite well, hospitality probably the best. Andrew Steinerman : Are there any slower growth verticals or really it's a rising tide here? Todd Schneider : Yeah. I would say I don't - none come to mind where I would say, yes, a slower type of growth. It's just - we're kind of a rising tide is the best way to put it. Andrew Steinerman : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ryan Gunning : Hey, good morning. It's actually Ryan Gunning filling in for Hamzah. My first question, just around the Fire Protection business. And if you could just talk about the competitive dynamics there and any opportunity for larger scale M&A in that business kind of similar to what you did with ZEE Medical and the First Aid side? Todd Schneider : Yeah, Ryan. This is Todd. We like our position in the Fire business and really like the Fire business. There, we understand the - how to go to market and how to make attractive margins in that business. And we're investing, we're investing in M&A, we're investing in infrastructure to make sure that we're able to service all of our customers. And we have a national offering in that business, some via sub-contracting. But nevertheless, a very attractive national approach, and we're positioned well. How we - our culture, our infrastructure, how we execute puts us in a good spot. And there's good momentum in that business. There was - you think about it, right? It's all - legally, you have to have that - those products and those services. But nevertheless, there was some pent up demand in it from repairs, right. So if you think about someone comes through and looks at your fire equipment, and there are some items that need to be repaired. During the pandemic, people are more so anxious to spend money on those types of subjects and - but as we're coming out of it, we're busy, we're busy in that area for many reasons, one of which is some pent up demand on repair, which is great business for us. Ryan Gunning : Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then switching over, could you provide any kind of visibility on like how much of your sales you consider today as pandemic, like non-recurring versus recurring and how you kind of define that? Todd Schneider : Yeah, great question. So when you think about, let's call it, PPE items that were really pandemic related, they are still at levels elevated from pre-pandemic, but we do not expect them to repeat at the levels that they were in fiscal '21. So if you think about our guidance, we think we would be - with the PPE that doesn't repeat, if it has - if it does repeat, then we would be in the, you know, on the high end, above 8% from an internal growth rate. So think about it that way about how much is - will not be repeating, that we don't expect to repeat, which kind of demonstrates the mix of business is going to be back closer - much closer to traditional. And there is some real good momentum there to get to the growth rates that we've guided towards. Ryan Gunning : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. In the Uniform Rental segment, can you talk a bit about sales rep productivity trends and how the pipeline is performing, especially moving through the quarter and entering fiscal 2022? Todd Schneider : George, I'm glad you asked about that. I have been so impressed by our sales organization, the creativity, the flexibility, the urgency, the intensity about which way they go about their jobs and how they have adapted to a crazy environment. And we try to work very hard to position them with great products and services so that people very much want to take their calls. And so we like where that's heading. The mix of business is obviously changing, but it's getting back to much more traditional, George. But there is a strong audience for the - our sales partners and in whom they are calling on, partly because there were some items that you - when people were going through the pandemic, they said, hey, I can't make a decision on uniforms right now, but I need some critical products to help my business run. We provided those critical products and services and its positioned us, now that it's closer to businesses getting back to normal, where we say, okay, now I'm ready to talk about those types of items. So all that is positive for us. You know, as we went through it, folks didn't realize that we had all the products and services that we do. So that opens some doors, and we're continuing to operate in those doors to help improve our business. George Tong : That's very helpful. And then switching gears to health care and hygiene. Those are very strong categories over the past year. Can you describe what kind of performance you're expecting structurally from those health care and hygiene categories, not just in fiscal 2022, but really looking forward? And then diving into PPE, you talked a little bit about normalization there in First Aid mix going back to pre-COVID levels over time, which has higher margins. Just talk a little bit about that evolving mix as well and the implications for growth and profitability? Todd Schneider : Yes, George, I'll start and Mike, Scott, Paul, if they want to jump in. We've spoken in the past about hygiene, cleanliness, all those subjects that the pandemic has done for those subjects what 9/11 did to security 20 years ago. And so what we're seeing is there's a greater focus on the health of employees, health of patients, health of guests, students, and hygiene is a big part of that. So we see that as something that will be elevated into the future, and we think that's good for society, that's good for our business and good certainly for all those individuals. So we think that's going to be something that's elevated, hopefully, in perpetuity. As far as PPE normalization, there is - there was a breakneck pace to get PPE last year because folks couldn't keep their doors open in certain cases couldn't work. So there was some real peaks last year. That is certainly less. We expect this year the variants, the delta variant, I think, brings a bit of a wildcard into that, which we're not going to try to predict. But nevertheless, as you see, as we go throughout the year, you will see much more normalization. You'll see more people using our traditional cabinets, First Aid products, hands and cabinets as we say, and PPE will be more moderate. Now just keep in mind, we've always been in the PPE business. We've always provided these products and services, it's just they were elevated. We will continue to offer them. But as more people get back to work in offices and machine shops, in government and education, there will be more people that will be consuming, from a first aid standpoint, our traditional types of bandages and tablets, et cetera. So hopefully, that gives you a little color. Paul Adler : And George, this is Paul. I just want to tell, you mentioned First Aid specifically too, so I just want to make sure we provided enough clarity there. That business, as Mike said, alluded to, it's in a transition period where, to Todd's point, so much PPE was provided. We seized the opportunity to come through for our customers and provide thermometers and masks and visors, et cetera. So it's an outsized percent of the revenue. That will transition, as we've been talking about the last couple of quarters. What I want to make sure everybody understands is that First Aid business is getting back to that more re-occurring revenue stream with that Cabinet Service business, which we are very excited about. And to think about a 9% or high single digit type of a growth rate for First Aid in fiscal '22, that's coming off a huge growth rate with a lot of PPE. So still a strong performance. And what I want to make sure people don't miss is that, in order to drive a high single digit growth rate in '22, with PPE declining, that Cabinet Service business is growing very strongly. And what that will do then is improve the margins going forward for the First Aid business in fiscal '22. And we probably won't get back all the way to pre-COVID levels in terms of margins in First Aid because, just like many of our businesses, it's a lot of small transactions. There's some momentum that has to build. But definitely, the margins will continue to improve through the year as we get back to servicing those cabinets. George Tong : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. I know you talked about the margin guidance earlier in the call and addressed the inflation impacts. But I wanted to see if you could provide maybe some additional detail around which business lines you're expecting to see the most strength from a margin perspective? Mike Hansen : Well, Toni, I would say, you know, all of our - we expect all of our businesses to perform very, very well. And in order for us to be able to guide in the way that we did from about flattish to up 70 basis points, we're going to need good performance out of all of our businesses. And that translates into very good incremental margins, especially in our Rental business. It's certainly, as Paul just described, it means that we're going to see some nice improvement in our First Aid margins as we see a bit of a mix shift. We expect continued good performance in our Fire business, as I think we mentioned 22% organic growth in the fourth quarter. We've got some great momentum, and we'll get some nice leverage as we move into the year. And then certainly, our Direct Sale business, those margins I would expect, from a percentage standpoint to really increase nicely, as we see those - see the revenue start to come back, that will allow us to get a little bit more efficient and certainly be able to leverage our infrastructure in that business. So we're looking for margin, good margin performance in all of our businesses all contributing to that guidance range, margin improvement and all contributing to a real healthy 20% to 30% incremental margins. Todd Schneider : Toni, the - obviously, we're guiding towards all of our businesses growing, incremental margins 20% to 30%. But when you think about it, obviously, the mix is going to change in all those businesses. And each of them sold, with the exception of Fire, there was some PPE. And so there's - we'll get back to more traditional type of mix. And that and the leverage on the additional revenue is going to help us. Toni Kaplan : That's great. And in your prepared remarks, you mentioned the 15 million to 20 million businesses that you don't currently service. Could you just talk about the recent industry outsourcing trends? Has that - have you seen that accelerate or flatten? And how do you go about reaching out to those businesses? Is that an initiative, a big opportunity for you any more so than historically? Just how should we think about the opportunity? Todd Schneider : Yes. Toni, the outsourcing trends continue, that has been positive. In addition, the focus on bringing manufacturing back to the United States and Canada, we think will be a positive, just that's obviously in the early innings. But both of those, we think, will be positives for our business. As far as reaching out, we have a significant investment in our infrastructure. And part of that infrastructure is in our route base, and part of that is in our sales organization. So that is a - that's a significant investment. You've probably also seen, I hope you've seen some of our investment in mass media that we're leveraging. Because we think it can pay dividends for that infrastructure. And there are one more thing we hear from customers and prospects, frankly, is, hey, I didn't know you did that. That is a product or a service that they didn't realize that we provided. So we're trying to leverage that and get the message out and to give a little air cover to our infrastructure. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please go ahead. Tim Mulrooney : Good morning, guys. I wanted to check in on the health care opportunity, which I know has gotten a lot of attention on recent calls. We haven't talked about it a lot yet today. You previously stated that I think that the vertical could expand from kind of 7% of sales today towards potentially 10% of sales over the next several years. But I know things are changing rapidly these days. So with another three months under your belt, I'm curious if those expectations have changed at all in either direction? Todd Schneider : Tim, this is Todd. I'll start. We don't see momentum slowing down in that area. Again, hospitals are getting a little bit back to more normal operations of how they run their business, and our value proposition resonates with them. We've talked often about the various products and services that we provide, scrubs being a big one, isolation gowns, but also cleaning products to help them provide a healthy environment. So there is a whole lot more focus on health and welfare now. Obviously, in the health care business, because of what they do for a living, there's always been a major focus on providing an environment that allowed for high patient satisfaction, that was not only in health, but also in image. So its - when you think about what they need, it's a great vertical for us and the products and services we provide. And there is a long runway there. We're providing products and services to help institutions that - I'd like to think you'd be impressed by the name of - the list of people we do business with. So who's who in that business. But nevertheless, we're not nearly as penetrated as where we can be, should be and will be. So we're very much in the early innings on that vertical still. Tim Mulrooney : Okay. Great. Thanks, Todd. And just switching gears, I apologize if you already addressed this. But how did energy costs impact the results this quarter? I don't know, maybe year-over-year sequentially or however you want to present it. But can you also talk about your expectation for energy cost that's built into your guidance, maybe for your fleet, but then also for your production plans? Thank you. Mike Hansen : Tim, our total energy costs for the quarter were 2.1% of revenue. That's up 30 basis points from the third quarter and that's up 40 basis points from a year ago. So we did certainly see some increase within the quarter. Our expectation is that those will remain elevated during fiscal '22, up at those levels, maybe even a little bit higher. So that's what we've got incorporated. Most of that increase being price at the pump, so our gas and our service, our routes. So that's what we've got in the guidance. Tim Mulrooney : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Gary Bisbee : Hi, guys. Good morning. I guess on revenue, first, I have one clarification and one question. I just wanted to clarify. So high single digit for First Aid, I heard that, and then I heard some discussion of the tough comps and I think the term bumpiness. Is high single digit the right number for the year, but maybe declines in the near term as you get through the toughest period of comps is not out of the question? Is that a fair statement on that business? And the question then on revenue, on the Rentals business, right, the long-term growth rate has been sort of in line with this guidance. You've got easy comps, you've had sequential improvement throughout last year. The fourth quarter had quite strong growth. I guess I wonder why you wouldn't be positioned to grow faster than the historical long-term trend given those factors in this year. Did the hygiene business within rentals have an outsized benefit from PPE that rolls off, and is that a drag? Or are there other factors beyond just your normal conservatism that might be weighing on that business? Thank you. Todd Schneider : So Gary, as far as the First Aid, yeah, think about it as high single digits for the year. As Mike stated, Q4 last year, Q1 - excuse me, Q4 of '20 was a huge growth rate for the First Aid business, as was Q1, so the comp from right now were really big. So as the year goes on, the PPE will - the comp will lessen. And as a result, our growth rates will be better in that business. So the bumpiness that Mike spoke about is simply the PPE comps in the early portions of this fiscal year versus last. As far as the Rental, yeah, as we mentioned in the past, there's PPE in that - in our results from last year in Rental as well. And again, just going back to our total guidance if the PPE would repeat, that we do not believe it will, this year, then you'd be into the - the number would start with an eight as far as internal growth. So how far into the eight? I really don't know. But nevertheless, we'd be picking up a heck of a lot of basis points in growth if that PPE repeated. So it's a headwind. We're proud that we provided the product to our customers. Our customers really valued it. It opened doors. Excuse the pun, but it kept their doors opened in many cases. And our Net Promoter Scores reflect it. So they were very appreciative that we were able to provide those products and services. If they need them again, we'll provide them. We just don't think that they'll be at the levels that they were in the past. Gary Bisbee : Thank you. And then a quick follow up. In the past, Mike, I think you've provided the breakdown of the Rentals business revenue in the fourth quarter by the various sub-segments. I wonder if you'd be willing to do that again this year? Paul Adler : Yeah, Gary, it's Paul. And we do - yeah, Gary, we have that information for you, excuse me. And I would preface it by saying, first of all, what we provided typically is a Q4 sample, Q4 fiscal '21 versus fiscal '20. Obviously, there's a lot of noise in these figures, excuse me, in that you know, it's an unprecedented time. Fiscal '20 fourth quarter was the onset of the pandemic. So a lot of job losses, a lot of pandemic-driven demand, as Todd just said, for certain items of PPE. So I want to throw that out there first. But last year's fourth quarter, so fiscal '20 Q4, Uniform Rental was 50% of the segment mix. Dust, which is the walk-off mats, mops, that was 18% of the mix. Hygiene products, those are the soaps, the air fresheners, sanitizing dispensers, et cetera, that's 14% last year. Shop towels were 4%, linens 10 and the catalog business, which is more like the direct - small direct sales component of the Rental business products off of the route from the drivers, that was 4%. So, then this year' s mix : uniform rental 48%; dust, 17%; hygiene at 17%; shop towels 4%; linens 9%; and catalog 5%. So again, obviously, COVID impacted results, not necessarily reflective of future performance. But with this breakout, you can obviously see how strongly hygiene performed. Typically, like in the Q4 of fiscal '20, that was mostly restroom type items, soaps and air fresheners, the paper. But in this Q4 '21, that hygiene percentage grew greater, driven by the sanitizer dispensers, the stands, the sanitizing sprays, et cetera. And then that catalog nudged up a little bit from 4% to 5%. And that's where a lot of the PPE in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services business that we've talked about is recorded, the masks, gloves, those types of items. Gary Bisbee : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. For my first one, I just wanted to follow up on the M&A comments earlier. It sounded like you have a very active pipeline that you're pursuing. I'm just curious if you could elaborate a little bit on what areas you may be pursuing and size of targets and how ripe things are. And then maybe what you're seeing with regard to multiples, good or bad, in the environment? Thanks. Todd Schneider : Scott, I'll say each of our businesses were acquisitive, but tuck-ins, certainly, some geographic expansion as well. So we're highly active. And there is folks that are at least answering phones and they are taking calls, and we'll see where that goes. Certainly, you wonder about changes to tax, potential changes to taxes, will that free things up? That will be interesting to see what happens with that. As far as the size and multiples, those types of things, you know, there's - everything's come from the very small to medium sized types, I won't comment on else, but it's - they're all active. And part of it is because multiples, if you look at it historically in the marketplace, they're pretty high. But we're quite active in that area because we look at it from a very long-term approach. And we know when we make those types of acquisitions that it positions us to grow those as well. Because of our broad offering of products and services that we bring to the table that in many cases, the folks that we're speaking to don't have that broadness, it allows for us to take a long-term approach and grow those businesses, whether it's just in that area of the business or cross selling it across each of our enterprise. Scott Schneeberger : Great, thanks. Appreciate that. And then my follow-up is a bit of a two parter, but it ties together pretty well. In Todd's section in the press release, there was mention of investment in - continued investment in technology, a competitive advantage. Just hoping you could elaborate on that. And then the back part of the question is, CapEx was down a lot in the past fiscal year, almost half of what it was in fiscal year '19 and down a good bit from fiscal '20. Just curious where that goes this year and maybe tie it together with the tech question? Thanks. Todd Schneider : Great. I'll start with the tech question, and then Mike can handle the CapEx, if he prefers. Scott, we're investing heavily there because we see a need to - from a - whether it's productivity or from a competitive advantage. All areas of our business, we talked about leveraging SAP, leveraging the platforms that come along with that, they have customer benefits and operational benefits for us, and then obviously, the data that goes along with that. But that being said, we see some opportunities in automation that we've been investing in over the years. And we see opportunities to get efficiencies out of our fleet that we're investing in that we think can pay big dividends in that area. And so we're focused on doing such and making it easier to do business with Cintas. So - and we think, as you do that, that provides leverage for us. So leverage in the marketplace. So Mike, I'll let you handle the CapEx question. Mike Hansen : Sure. From a CapEx perspective, clearly, the amounts were down in this past year because capacity needs just weren't the same as they had been in the previous years. We certainly kept up the CapEx for maintenance activities. But as we - there's a bit of a lag between when we need new capacity and when this revenue starts to - has started to come back. And we've seen some momentum, but there will be a little bit of a lag in the CapEx. Having said that, I expect we'll get back to historical levels by the end of the fiscal year. And that puts us probably in the $200 million to $250 million range for fiscal '22. But certainly, when we invest, we will certainly - when we need to invest, whether it's capacity, technology or otherwise, we will certainly do that. Paul Adler : Yeah. The great news is, regarding our investment in the ERP system, SAP, that we've talked about a lot. I mean, a lot of that investment spending in that - some of the major expense is behind us, and it took us a while to roll it out and get the entire network into SAP. We had the G&K acquisition that added more locations and kind of slowed down the time to complete it. Then we had the pandemic. And so the exciting thing is the additional investment will continue to be made throughout the business, of course, still in technology. But a lot of it's already paid for. And now it's perfecting the system, taking the toy, so to speak, out of the box and not just using it for the Xs and Os of running the business, but using it to meet that competitive advantage to give us the data analytics and the other advantages that we haven't had previously. Scott Schneeberger : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our final question today comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys. This is actually Bryan on for Kevin. Thanks for squeezing us here. Thanks for the commentary kind of around the color sort of on the re-opening and you don't expect - not all customers are quite back yet. So just drilling in that a little bit, how should we think about you know, sort of what percentage of clients are still inactive versus maybe kind of how that compares to out of businesses or attrition that we would see just to kind of frame that in. And any sort of commentary around how that shakes out geographically, either geographically or by vertical here in the US? Todd Schneider : So Bryan, I don't have a specific number for you, but just generally speaking, I'd say most businesses are back to some degree, not certainly back to full bore. We mentioned Canada specifically as an outlier, which we expect, let's just say, by August, September to be back much closer to normal. But one of the big issues is there are 7 million people less working today than there were a year ago or so. And of those 7 million people, I don't know what - how many of them are Cintas wearers or will be, but there's a percentage of. And we want those to - certainly see those folks get back to work. And whether they're wearing uniforms or utilizing our First Aid products and services, all that impacts us. So the - for the most part, businesses are back. They're certainly not anywhere near where we think they will be over time. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Okay. And then last one here for us. You guys talked about continuing to expand on ESG reporting. And you know, certainly, what we've noticed is the ESG scores tend to focus on the internal operations. But we'd be curious if you could just touch on maybe how you guys help your customers achieve their ESG goals? Thanks. Todd Schneider : Yeah. Bryan, great question. Again, our heritage, what we do - and frankly, as I'm speaking of the Rental business, what our industry does, the impact that it has on saving customers water, energy, what we do to treat water instead of it going down into the sewer. Because those products, whether they're garments or towels or what have you, all that, they're going to be either purchased and thrown in the garbage or purchased and cleaned at home. And in both cases, we are helping substantially those folks helping the environment and helping to save landfill space, helping to fill or excuse me, save water, energy and the cleanliness of water as well. And I don't think we've told the story well enough in the past, because at our heritage, we are a wash and reuse business. And again, without our industry, there would be millions of more gallons and units of energy and et cetera that will be utilized because they're going to be either thrown to the landfill or laundered somehow. And we know that we are infinitely more efficient at laundering those products than they would be at home or in another type of setting. Mike Hansen : You know, I might add also that when you think about our First Aid and Safety and Fire businesses, the purpose of those businesses are to keep our customers, employees safe and healthy. And so it's a little bit of a different ESG angle than what Todd was talking about. But from an employee perspective, our goals are to help our customers really achieve the safety and the health of their employees. So we're looking out for them from that S perspective of the ESG as well. Operator : All right. Thank you. And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Adler, at this time, I'll turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Paul Adler : All right. Thanks, Nick. And thank you all for joining us this morning. We will issue our first quarter of fiscal '22 financial results in September. And we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Have a good day. Operator : And this concludes today's call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President and Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Paul Adler : Thanks, Shelly. Thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2022. After our commentary, we'll open the call to questions for analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Todd. Todd Schneider : Thank you, Paul. We are pleased with our start to fiscal 2022. First quarter total revenue grew 8.6% and diluted earnings per share or EPS grew 11.9%. Every business, whether goods-producing or services-providing, has a need for image, safety, cleanliness , or compliance. Every business has a need Cintas can fulfill to help get them Ready for the Workday. Our financial results are indicative of our strong value proposition and vast total addressable market. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue was $1.51 billion, compared to $1.39 billion last year. Organic revenue growth was 8.2%. We expected solid growth over the year prior period in which the economy was in a weakened state, but we also made solid progress on a sequential basis. And in total, revenue grew stronger than anticipated. We continued to make measured investments to support our growth. The labor market remains challenging. U.S. still hasn't recovered 5.3 million pre-pandemic jobs. This represents an opportunity for us. Most of our customers are open. However, most are not operating at the same capacity and employment levels as pre-COVID. We are seeing inflationary signs, including higher cost of freight, energy, wages, and supplies. We continue to take actions to minimize the impacts. These include reviewing and challenging our processes and procedures, produce efficiencies, and reduce costs and thoughtfully implementing increases to the pricing of certain products and services in response to higher operational costs. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for first quarter was $199.1 million compared to $204.5 million last year. First quarter revenue was up against a very difficult comparison. In last year's first quarter, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, personal protective equipment, or PPE, sales were surging propelling the business to grow organic revenue over 17%. At that time, PPE comprised an outsized percentage of First Aid and Safety Services revenue mix. As discussed on previous earnings calls, the amount of PPE has declined as COVID case counts have fallen from peak levels. However, PPE remains a larger percentage of the revenue mix than it was pre-COVID. Over the same period of time, the recurring First Aid cabinet service business revenue has increased. We welcome this shift in mix because First Aid Cabinet Service business is historically higher profit margin business and more consistent. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All other revenue was $189.7 million compared to $147.7 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue growth rate was 17.8%, and the Uniform Direct Sale business growth rate was 68%. Both businesses benefited in part from increased activity in a period of reduced COVID case counts. Regarding our balance sheet and cash flow, our financial position remains strong. Recently, on September 15, we paid shareholders $98.8 million in quarterly dividends. The amount per share of common stock paid of $0.95 represents a 26.7% increase of the company's previous quarterly dividend. We continue to allocate capital to improve shareholder return. I'm proud of the execution of our employees, whom we call partners. They continue to navigate an unsettled environment by focusing on our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic continues, of course, fueled recently by the surge of the Delta variant. We remain well positioned headed into the fall and winter months to provide potentially life-saving items such as face masks and gloves, provide hygienically-clean garments such as health care scrubs and isolation gowns and conduct services, including hand sanitizer dispensing and sanitizing spray services. Now before turning the call over to Mike, I want to highlight a recent announcement of our ambition to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Cintas was founded on a sustainable business model. Our corporate culture is based on doing what's right and challenging ourselves to improve. We view our ambition to achieve this objective as a natural extension. Also, as part of our steadfast commitment to corporate responsibility, we will soon issue a more robust environmental, social, and governance report. We are committed to protecting the environment, enhancing humanity, and maintaining accountability. I will now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Hansen : Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2022 first quarter revenue was $1.9 billion compared to $1.75 billion in last year's first quarter. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 8.6%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '22 was $902.8 million compared to $826.2 million in last year's first quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased 30 basis points to 47.6% for the first quarter of fiscal '22 compared to 47.3% in the first quarter of fiscal '21. Gross margin percentage by business was 48.3% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services; 44.8% for First Aid and Safety Services; 46.1% for Fire Protection Services; and 41.5% for Uniform Direct Sale. Selling and administrative expenses of $508.7 million increased 6.7% compared to last year's first quarter. This increase reflects investments in our sales teams as well as slight incremental travel and meeting expenses, somewhat offset by the sale of assets within our Uniform Direct Sale business. Operating income of $394.1 million increased 12.7%. Operating margin increased 80 basis points to 20.8% in the first quarter of fiscal '22 compared to 20% in the first quarter of fiscal '21. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '22 was 11% compared to 7.8% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '22 was $331.2 million, an increase of 10.4%. Diluted EPS was $3.11, an increase of 11.9% from last year's first quarter. We are increasing our fiscal '22 financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $7.53 billion to $7.63 billion to a range of $7.58 billion to $7.67 billion; and diluted EPS from a range of $10.35 to $10.75 to a range of $10.60 to $10.90. Please note the following regarding our guidance : Fiscal '22 -- our fiscal '22 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 19.5% compared to a rate of 13.7% for fiscal '21. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '22 diluted EPS guidance by about $0.77 and diluted EPS growth by about 760 basis points. Guidance does not include any future share buybacks or potential tax reform. Guidance assumes an uneven economic recovery caused by the surge in COVID-19 Delta variant. However, guidance does not contemplate significant pandemic-related setbacks such as stay-at-home orders and other restrictions commonly referred to as lockdowns. Finally, when modeling our fiscal '22 financial results by quarter, please note the following regarding last fiscal year's financial results : In last fiscal year second quarter, certain Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating assets were sold. The pretax gain on sale of $18 million was recorded in selling and administrative expenses and impacted second quarter operating margin by 100 basis points. The pretax gain and the related tax benefit impacted EPS by $0.25. And in last fiscal year's third quarter, we were able to help our customers respond to a spike in COVID-19 cases by providing them with large supplies of personal protective equipment. We provided more personal protective equipment in that quarter than in any other. Paul Adler : That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Tim Mulrooney : Can you talk about the primary factors that led you to raise revenue guidance this quarter? Was it primarily related to the better-than-expected result that you generated here in the first quarter? Or is it more related to your outlook for the remaining three quarters of this fiscal year? Todd Schneider : Hey, Tim. It's Todd. Thanks for the question. Well, certainly, our performance in Q1 exceeded our expectations, but we like the momentum that we see in our business. We like the new business, that\u2019s as a driver of growth for us. And we're providing more products and services to our customers. So, to those who are open and hopefully will -- they'll be back to full strength here very shortly. But in general, yes, we like the momentum that we see in our businesses. Tim Mulrooney : Okay, thanks, Todd. I was wondering if you could also maybe talk about growth by vertical a little bit more this quarter. I know hospitality was showing a strong recovery last quarter. Did that vertical stall out a little bit as COVID cases ramped up here in August and September? And are there any other end markets that you call out here as being somewhat stronger or weaker than you had expected? Todd Schneider : Well, great question, Tim. Certainly, the hospitality business is -- well, so far down, hospitality was -- that it's coming back and it's coming back nicely. I wouldn't use the word stalled out by any stretch. Certainly, there is a bit of a tail to that. So, orders aren't received and shipped in real time, meaning that they make those decisions about staffing. There's a process, they place the orders, we ship them, et cetera. So, there's a little bit of a tail there. But we still like what we see in the hospitality business. Certainly, they are anxious about business travel coming back, convention travel specifically, but the -- in general, the hospitality business is doing so much better. And -- but they're a little bit anxious, right, about how things will be impacted because of the variant, but also when will business travel come back. As far as our other areas, healthcare continues to do well for us. We've talked about those offerings that we have, and they really resonate with those folks. So, whether it's helping them clean their facilities, helping with isolation gowns, scrubs, et cetera, all that is very attractive for folks. And I'd just like to take a moment to talk about what we compete with in those markets, in many cases, is disposables. And with the focus on ESG, that value proposition of providing an item that is essentially relaundered and recycled is very attractive, separate from the economics of it. It's very attractive for the healthcare institutions and many institutions to say, \"Well, you can provide me a product that doesn't just go to landfill after a use.\" So again, that value proposition is very much resonating. Operator : We'll take our next question from Andy Wittmann with R. W. Baird. Andy Wittmann : Great. I don't usually ask about the Direct Sales segment, but I'm going to this quarter. The segment margins in All Other came out very strong. We haven't seen them this strong in a while, obviously, plus 68%. It's a big number, but we all know that the compare was fairly easy. Todd, could you just talk a little bit about what drove the margin leverage? Was there an unusually large order that came back with somebody kind of redressing folks? Or maybe just a little bit of color what -- as to what drove the great profit margins in the All Other reportable segment? Todd Schneider : Well, Andy, first off, thanks for your question. Our partners in that area of the business really appreciate you calling it out and citing that their performance is really, really good. You're right. The comps are -- were more than reasonable because of what happened to the hospitality business, in particular, last summer. But our revenue is coming back very nicely there, hence, the revenue growth. But -- and we're getting leverage over the organization staffing levels that we have in place, and Mike cited that we had sale of an asset that occurred in that area. So -- but in total, if you put it all together, we see -- you shouldn't anticipate that level of increase in the future. But nevertheless, we like the leverage we have there and we think we're well positioned. Our organization is -- was as you can imagine right-sized as a result of what occurred last summer, and we think we're in a really good spot and to capture opportunities in the marketplace and gain leverage on our investment. Mike Hansen : Well, the other half or part of that All Other segment is the Fire business, which also had a great first quarter. And so, we're very pleased with that business and the momentum in that business as well. We saw some nice sequential improvement in the gross margin of the Fire business. And at organic growth of 17.8%, we're thrilled with the performance that we've seen. Andy Wittmann : Yes. Okay. And then I guess, just for my follow-up question, I wanted to just get a little bit more specific on the labor market, both as it relates to your own business, your ability to hire and compensate people as well as the impact on your customers. I don't know if there's a way for you guys to talk to us about the level of staffing at your -- you're always selling new business, but the historical customers that you've had through this whole time, what does the headcount look like for those customers? Are they still -- can you quantify how far down they are? I mean we talked about the 5 million jobs that are still missing. How many of those were former Cintas wearers? Todd Schneider : Yes, Andy, first of all, you can't open up a newspaper without hearing about wages and pressure in the market on labor. So, we are certainly not immune from that nor are our customers. And so, we are battling it every single day and staffing at levels that we feel very good about in our business. And as far as our customers, I mean it's really difficult to say -- to put a number on it. It varies so much based upon geographies and industries, because the restaurant business is certainly -- they're nowhere near back to where I think they -- hopefully will be someday and certainly not back to where they were pre-COVID, as an example, warehousing and distribution is back very, very nicely and probably at or above pre-COVID levels. In total, we're certainly down from pre-pandemic levels, and I think we're representative of the 5-point-something million jobs that we have less in the U.S. versus pre-COVID. So, we're anxious for our customers to get back to previous levels. And when we think about labor, and we think about those functions, we always focus more about how it impacts our customers, we'll figure things out and how to manage it. Paul Adler : On not only 5.3 million jobs lost, right, versus pre-pandemic, but still 10 million, 11 million job openings that haven't been filled, which is great opportunity for us as you know. Todd Schneider : Yes. The latest number I saw from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that they reported out earlier this month was 10.9 million job openings. So I don't know how many of those would be people that would wear a Cintas uniform and utilize items out of our first aid cabinets, et cetera. But we'd like to see those all be filled. Operator : We'll take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital. Manav Patnaik : I just had one question for you guys. And I was just hoping, you talked about wage and labor a bit, but can you just talk about the moving pieces on the cost side? We've heard a lot about driver shortages and fuel costs and supply chain. I was just hoping you guys could just give us a quick state of what's happening with you guys? Todd Schneider : So Manav, I'll start, and then Mike can assist with this. Certainly, energy costs are increasing. We're seeing that, whether it's at the pump, natural gas to run our facilities. But we've worked really hard on efficiencies in routing and in our production facilities to maximize efficiencies there to mitigate all of that. And we're -- I think we're doing a very good job there. Wages, we talked a little bit about. But we have discussed in previous earnings calls that we've been addressing this wage issue with particular focus on our frontline partners over the past couple of years. So we weren't flat footed when it came into this wage subject. We're continuing to address it. We've got to be very competitive in the marketplace to attract the right partners on our team, and we're doing that. And we're going to be able to continue to navigate that successfully. And then as you can imagine, we've been very diligent about managing discretionary spend. There is some travel that is back, but certainly not near the levels that they were pre-COVID. Mike, anything else? Mike Hansen : No, I think that hits the cost side, but Manav also keep in mind, we talked a little bit about this in July. But we have begun to increase prices here in the first quarter. It's a strategic local customer-by-customer view but early indications suggest a positive reception from our customer base. And certainly, that's important as we look at things, like energy being up 40 basis points year-over-year. We're not immune to some inflationary pressures, but we are -- as Todd said, we're managing them very, very diligently. We're looking for automation opportunities, efficiency opportunities. And if we need to, we can strategically increase prices and we've started to do that here in this first quarter after taking a few years off. Manav Patnaik : Got it. And actually, maybe if I can squeeze in one more. Just hoping you could give us an update on the M&A pipeline perhaps in the non-uniform businesses? Like are there opportunities that you guys are actively seeking? Todd Schneider : Great question, Manav. We're active and acquisitive in every business we're in. We'll say that activity has ramped up here in the back half of the year, probably anticipation of tax changes, et cetera. But nevertheless, some. So we like the activity. We've -- we have -- we are in a great financial position. We love our balance sheet and right after investing in our existing facilities to help grow those organizations, our #2 use of capital is for M&A. And so we're very acquisitive and looking very active, and looking forward to closing on more deals in the near future. Operator : We'll take our next question from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Hamzah Mazari : I just wanted to follow up on pricing. You had mentioned you hadn't taken pricing for a while, I think, maybe 2 years or 18 months or whatever. And I think you just referenced you're beginning to take price now. What kind of price is baked into your guidance? And how are the customer conversations? I assume customers see inflation headlines all over the place. So -- and given you have an increased pricing for a while, could you maybe talk about order of magnitude? Are you doing a pricing catch-up? Or how should we think about pricing strategy? Todd Schneider : Hamzah, I wouldn't think of it as a catch-up. And we had not raised price in 2 years. But these are -- Mike mentioned, these are strategic decisions. Their pricing is a local subject. It really gets down to what type of what industry is that business in, what even geography are they in, and what condition of their -- is their business and to be able to handle it, so that we're able to be fair with our customers as we look out. Meaning, that there are certain organizations that are -- their business is doing a whole lot better than others. And we're conscious of that. But as far as the conversations, again, that would depend upon the particular business. But it does make the conversation easier when inflation is so much in the headlines. So that certainly gives us a little benefit. But these conversations are -- they're never easy, right? Because from our customer standpoint, it's a tough subject. And -- but we're focused on the long-term value of those customer relationships, and we handle them appropriately. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. And just my follow-up question would just be around -- just the -- I know it's been a while since the SAP implementation was completed but then COVID hit, and we were sort of caught up in that, and it's still kind of going on. But maybe you could just give some examples on how the SAP system is maybe benefiting you now as organic growth comes back? Maybe if you want to talk about it qualitatively or quantitatively, however, either on the cost side or revenue side? Any examples would kind of be helpful. Todd Schneider : Yes, Hamzah. So a few items on SAP that where we're benefiting from. Certainly, one view of the customer is significant for us. And that helps us with cross-sell. And we know when we do that, when we are able to provide more products and services, the customer sees more value. And when they see more value, it's a better retention tool for us. So that's been significant for us and has been and will continue to be moving forward. We get some other -- certainly advantaged from a data analytics standpoint, the cash cycle, those types of subjects. But some other items that I think you might be able to see out in the marketplace is routing efficiencies are a real opportunity for us. We are focused on that from a dollar efficiency from our ambition on the 2050 net zero emissions. And we see we can advance that subject, advance all much further than we have in the past by bringing technology to that. So that will be exciting. The other item is with SAP, it allows for us to have an online experience for our customers that they haven't had in the past. And what we realized is that our customers want -- they don't all want to communicate with us the way that they did when I started with the company 32 years ago, meaning they don't want to just have to call during working hours. They want to do business when they want to do business, whether that's to pay a bill, whether that's to communicate a request, to order something, those types of items are all -- we want to make it easier to do business with us. And on our online presence, and we call it My Cintas, allows for our customers to do just that. So providing more value to them, more conduits for them to communicate with us, instead of having to do it in the old traditional nine-to-five type model. So those are significant for us. Another operational item would be our ability to speed up the process from when we see an order from a customer -- receive an order from a customer to when we can get it out to them. Having that transparency throughout our supply chain, is an absolute advantage where we can anticipate better. And even once we receive the order, get it out the door faster than what we were historically. And so that efficiency shows up to the customer in speed to market and then able to get them products and faster than we had in the past. So we want to leverage that system. And I think we've done that quite nicely to date, but there will be more coming. Operator : We'll take our next question from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Revenue growth in the quarter was stronger than you expected on a sequential basis. Can you elaborate on the sources of upside, specifically? And where you see the most promising trends over the next year? Todd Schneider : George, I'll start, but I'd say two significant drivers of growth for us have been new business. It's still quite robust. Our value proposition is resonating very much. And many companies are still struggling with staffing as we cited earlier, 10.9 million job openings. And when you're struggling with staffing and you can find a company like Cintas, you can outsource certain functions too, it makes it very attractive. So they look at it and say, wow, you can take care of these items and maybe they were a do-it-yourself in the past, so that resonates with them. So that's been quite nice. Most of -- and moving on to another driver, most of our customers were, I'd say, are open and probably were open going into the first quarter. But we are providing more products and services to them. We are, again, anxious for them to get back to their pre-employment levels and we think that will be even better. But new business and then I'd say, again, adds within our current customers are two significant drivers for us that we think will continue to help us throughout the year. George Tong : Got it. That's helpful color. And then I wanted to dive into pricing increases, which you touched on earlier. To what extent do you think that pricing combined with efficiencies can fully offset the input cost increases that you're seeing? And could there be a timing lag as to when those pricing increases will take effect and the real-time nature of the input cost increases that you're seeing now? Mike Hansen : Yes, George, certainly, timing, it is difficult to match up the timing exactly to when costs increase match up the timing exactly to when costs increase and when we see changes in the supply chain, for example. But we're doing our best to manage. And the -- as I mentioned a little bit ago, when we have those conversations today, the message resonates that look, there are increases in cost and these price increases, when we do make them, they are reasonable and they make sense to our customers. That's been our experience so far. The really nice thing about our -- if you think about our cost structure as well, Todd hit on this a little bit, that our labor, we've been working on that for a while. And so we may not be -- while not immune, we may not be as affected as some of our peers and others. And so that's important for us. The other part is that many of our material costs are amortized. So when we see spikes in supply chains in various areas, whether it is labor throughout the world or cotton or other things, we're amortizing costs and it tends to be a bit of a natural hedge for us. And so it does slow down the impact and it requires the impact to be greater for a much longer period of time before it really starts to hit us. And in those cases, we can get ahead of the inflationary pressures a little bit with our pricing strategy. So generally speaking, we feel like we're -- while it's not perfect matching of expense and benefit, we do a pretty good job and we get a little bit of benefit from just the way our business works. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ashish Sabadra with RBC. Ashish Sabadra : Mike, I just wanted to drill down further on the cross-sell opportunities that you mentioned. I was wondering if you could provide any color on where you are in penetrating, let's say, hygiene products, safety as well as first aid and fire services within your existing customer base? And how can you accelerate that cross-sell either through organic or through M&A? Any color on those fronts? Todd Schneider : Ashish, thanks for the comments and the question. We have our sales and service organization well positioned to offer the various products and services. Again, they have tools that allow them to understand where those opportunities exist. They're certainly not perfect, but they are allowing them to get pointed in the right direction to help provide that value to the customers. And as I mentioned, the more value -- excuse me, more products and services we provide the customer, we know the stickier that, that relationship will be just like most relationships, right? If it's just one product, it's probably more at risk than having two and so on and so forth. So it's very much a point of focus. When you think about our relationships, every single customer virtually needs, our fire surface, right, because of the legal requirements around that subject. But we see very nice overlap with those who would -- who are uniform customers who would need some direct sale their uniform rental. And we also see overlap with those who are uniform rental customers who would need first aid and safety products, training, CPR, all the various items that we provide. So it's -- our big issue has been in the past that our customers weren't aware of everything we provided. And that's a nice problem to have, but nevertheless, it's still very much a problem for us. And we're trying to change that position in the marketplace that our customers realize that not just through our sales and service organization but also through our mass media spend, which you may have seen this past weekend where we had a significant position on -- in golf's Ryder Cup, where we're trying to get the message out about all the products and services we provide. And not a complete one-stop shop for a business, but we sure do get them a long ways on that path. Mike, anything else on this? Mike Hansen : Well, the only thing I would add is the really good news is we're in the early innings of penetration. And so when you think about the rental customers and the opportunity to continue to penetrate with even rental items, such as our restroom products and our things that we've talked about recently in the last year, like isolation gowns and hand sanitizers, we're in the very early innings. And when you couple that with the first day of safety and fire opportunities again, less than 20% penetration. And so we've got a lot of work to do and a so we've got a lot of work to do and a exciting thing is much opportunity remains. Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful color. That's great. And maybe just a quick clarifying question. I was just wondering at a very high level, can you provide what are the key categories of spend and the percentage of expenses from labor versus fuel versus amortization of equipment? Any color would be helpful. Mike Hansen : Sure. Let me start with energy. So energy, and that would include fuel for our trucks and the running of our laundry operations, in the quarter was 2.1%. That is up 40 basis points from a year ago, flat with our fourth quarter. So it's a -- while it is up some, it's still a relatively insignificant part of our overall cost structure. When you think, Ashish, about our cost structure, though, you can -- I'm going to use cost of rentals. You can think about it in 3 buckets, the cost of the materials, the cost of running the laundries and then the cost of the service component. And while they're not exactly the same, you can think about them as 1/3 each. And each of those buckets are a little bit different. I mentioned the materials, many of which we amortize over certain periods of time. So we get a little bit of smoothing of those costs. And then we also have some that are direct sale type like the restroom products that we expensed immediately. The major component of that would be those rental items that we're amortizing. When you think about the laundries, then you're -- then we're into the depreciation of the buildings and certainly, the equipment that's in our wash alleys, but also the labor component within that as well. And then the service component, you've got our drivers, our trucks and the amortization of the trucks and the gas to run those. When you put it all together, certainly, labor is a large part of our cost structure. The materials, the products that we sell are certainly a large part of our structure. And we manage each one of those quite tightly and look for improvement opportunities. Operator : We'll take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Jeffrey Goldstein : This is actually Jeff on for Toni. I know this question was asked earlier related to revenue guidance, but I wanted to ask it slightly different as it relates to EPS. The EPS guide is up by about 2% for the full year, but it seems like a lot of that is maybe flowing through the buybacks and a better-than-expected tax rate. So is that fair? And is that to say from an operating standpoint, maybe you're a little bit more optimistic on the revenue side, but maybe some cost headwinds keep you a little conservative here? Just some more color on that would be helpful. Mike Hansen : Sure, Jeff. I don't think that's a fair reflection of our guidance. You think about our guidance of $10.60 to $10.90 that's a 3.5% to 6.4% increase in annual EPS. But you referred to a lower tax rate, our tax rate is going to -- based on our guide today is going to go up 5.8% compared to '21. Now that's quite a significant impact. And if you think about the 760 basis points that I referred to in my opening remarks, that takes EPS growth from about 11% to 14%. Now certainly, the buyback that we had done in the fourth quarter and the first quarter did create some benefit, but that still gets to a pretax earnings growth in the range of double-digits. And so it's a pretty good year. And then if you kind of move further up, we talked in July about our guidance of implying operating improvement of -- at the low end, 0 basis points to 70 at the high end, we're still right around in that neighborhood in terms of the guidance that we provided today. And keep in mind, that's on the heels of a 310 basis point improvement in operating margin in the previous fiscal year. So to kind of margin in the previous fiscal year. So to kind of taxes, I think, is not a great reflection of really what's going on. The guidance on the EPS side is nice, healthy margin improvement, pretax increases of right around double digits and then a higher tax rate that pulls that EPS down. Hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color on that EPS guidance. Jeffrey Goldstein : No, understood. That was helpful. And then I want to ask about First Aid margins, which were pretty strong in the quarter. Are you able to quantify at all how much PPE is still constraining margins there, just given it's greater than normal mix? And then I guess based on that, how should we think about near-term upside as that rolls off? Like is that really going to kick up in the next few quarters as that roll off? Just kind of overall, if you could talk about the path back to pre-COVID margins in that line of business. Mike Hansen : Sure. We certainly -- PPE has been a major factor in that business. And Jeff, you're correct in pointing that out. And it was a -- it was really important for our customers over the course of the last year, and we invested quite a bit in inventory to be able to serve the customers, even if it was at a bit of a lower gross margin for us. But we've seen some nice sequential improvement there. Our 44.8% is still lower than our pre-pandemic of, call it, 48-ish percent. And so we're -- we still believe we can get back to those kinds of levels. Now the PPE that we've had over the course of the last year tends to drop off a little bit more quickly than the First Aid comes back because, as Todd and Paul have referenced, we still have a lot of job openings, quite a bit fewer people in the workplace today than pre-pandemic. And so as those people come back and as those job openings get filled, that creates more hands in our first aid cabinets. And that creates some nice momentum. One of the nice things that we really have seen coming out of the last few quarters is our customers and our new customers, so prospects turning into customers, are really seeing the value of keeping their employees safe and healthy, and our First Aid business really allows us to provide that value to them. And so our new business has been really strong in this first aid cabinet space. But it's coming back. And while we like the momentum, we're not there yet. And we do expect to see sequential improvement. And I'll maybe step that back a bit. We expect to see improvement in the year every quarter can be a little bit bumpy here and there. But generally speaking, we continue to look for improved gross margin in that business. Operator : We'll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Securities. Gary Bisbee : If I could go back to labor for a minute, I think a lot of your comments have been about cost and working on wages. But are you fully staffed both from a service and a sales perspective? And if you had seen any elevated turnover relative to history or had any increased difficulty hiring to support the rebound in growth you're seeing? Todd Schneider : Gary, a very good question. I guess the way I'd describe it is, we're having to run at higher RPMs to get the output that we want. So it's harder. There's no doubt about it. Attracting, retaining and developing the talent is core to what we do as a company, and we're working that much harder now to get to the levels that we want to be at. So are we staffed at the levels we want to be at? Yes. Yes, we like our staffing position. Turnover is still very manageable. And I think it speaks to many, many things. Certainly, the total compensation that we provide, the attractive benefits, but it really speaks to the culture and the investment that we put in to people, because for so many partners that have grown up in the company and have and have advanced in the company, and that's part of our culture. So we've always had to be really good at painting a picture for people about this is where you start, but we will invest and develop you. And we're having to work harder at it, but it's still resonating with folks. And so that's where we are now. Gary Bisbee : Okay. Great. And then on -- you've talked about the PP&E and some of the pandemic-driven sales in first aid and safety. But I think you also had some of that in uniforms handling that stuff through the facilities business. Is -- and I'm not going to ask you when it's going to go away because who knows, but is there a meaningful chunk of revenue there that probably churns off in the future? And what I'm really trying to think through is how that could impact the rate of growth over the next several quarters or whatever in the core uniforms business. Is it elevated? Or is that just not a big deal in the grand scheme of that business? Todd Schneider : Yes, Gary, what Mike spoke of, it was a significant portion of our First Aid and Safety business. There was certainly some revenue that went through our rental business sold on route, that was for PPE, but nowhere near the amount as a percentage that would go through our First Aid business. So is there some there today? There's a little bit, but it's not significant whatsoever. So -- and as far as when we look out about demand, we're still in a good spot if the demand is there for those types of products and services. We're managing that inventory. And there is still demand. We still hope as a country and as North America, as a world that, that is -- that will be diminishing over the course of the balance of our fiscal year. So our guide takes all that into account. And we're focused on building the core of our business. And -- but if our customers need those types of products and services, we're there for them, and we will help them with this. Mike Hansen : Gary, I might just add, as you're thinking about -- I believe you referred to the next several quarters, as I said in my opening remarks, we talked last third quarter about $45 million that we did not expect to repeat in our fourth quarter. And so that's going to be -- as you think about the growth of quarter-to-quarter, definitely keep that in mind as a third quarter growth impact.  Now again, as it relates to this PPE, look, the safety and cleanliness themes that we've sold under for years is really resonating. And we certainly believe that those areas will be larger moving forward than pre-COVID and that certainly is exciting for us. Operator : We'll take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : I want to hone in a little bit on the offsetting efficiencies of the environment in the automation. Just anecdotally, if you could speak to a few things you're doing. I know in Hamzah's question, you talked about SAP and automation of payments and customer facing. Just curious if you could elaborate maybe a little bit on what you're doing in this environment, maybe at facilities or otherwise and some of the longer-term goals of other automation? Todd Schneider : Good morning, Scott. There\u2019s a couple of obvious ones for us. I mentioned routing. That is obviously a significant one that we think is going to pay dividends for us. Scott Farmer always spoke about, we don't generate any revenue when the wheels are turning on our trucks, right? We generate revenue when the wheels stop. And we see an opportunity to improve that efficiency and that we're investing in technology there to do so, and we're excited about the impact that will have not only on our cost structure, but also on our emissions as we move forward. In the production facilities, we are managing very tightly our wash alley and making sure that we have much better efficiencies there, meaning we're tracking very closely the number of loads that go through our facilities versus the quantity that went through pre-COVID on the same playing field, meaning same amount of volume that's going through. And we put some technology in place to help us with that instead of just doing it through elbow grease. And as a result, we're seeing some real benefits there. And again, that will help us in our cost structure, but also in our emissions. And so we're focused on making sure that we're managing that very tightly and we're seeing some benefits there. Mike Hansen : Yes, I'm not -- one other one I might talk about, I don't know that Todd mentioned the stock rooms in our laundry facilities and the ability to get those automated, and that creates visibility and it creates the opportunity to share. And when we are more efficient in our stockrooms, so let me be clear, our stockrooms are within our -- within all of our rental facilities, they are garment that have been in service already. And so when we are efficient, that means we are reusing garments that are already amortizing in our cost structure. And so that's -- that creates revenue generation out of garments that are either already in our cost structure or maybe have been amortized fully. And so we get some real nice incremental margins when we can more efficiently use those or put back those garments into service. SAP has allowed us to get visibility and to be able to improve the use of those garments within our stockroom. So that's another example, Scott, of something that's really benefiting us. Scott Schneeberger : Excellent. Sounds good, guys. I appreciate that. And then just as a follow-up, I wanted to touch on -- it sounds like you're very active in M&A, that came up, I think, particularly before calendar year-end, maybe with some consideration for tax implications. But you've done over $1 billion worth of stock buybacks in the fourth and the first quarter here, back to back, and that's just kind of looking back, that's as big, if any, year going back for a while. So I'm just kind of curious how -- the thought process there, if -- it sounds like you're getting closer on some M&A, but it's not really a lot of allocation of capital is going into repurchase. Is that something we should expect to continue? Todd Schneider : Scott, we are -- as I mentioned, we're active, and it takes two to dance, and we're seeing more folks at the dance as -- anecdotally, my guess is because of tax reform. And as a result, we think more deals will come through. Now, that being said, we are in a great position on our balance sheet. And we are ready, willing and able to activate that balance sheet as appropriate that is best for the long-term value for our organization. And just as a reminder, the #1 priority for our capital is, has been and will continue to be the investment into our current business to help grow the sales and profits of our organization, whether that's through additional products and services, additional facilities, training, staffing levels, all those is our #1 priority. And then after that, #2 is M&A, and we're steadfast in that commitment, and we'll allocate appropriately. And then thereafter, then we'll return it to the shareholders as available in the form of stock buyback and dividends. And I think we've got a really good track record of managing those priorities appropriately and intelligently for the long-term value. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Speakers, at this time, I will turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. Paul Adler : Thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our second quarter of fiscal '22 financial results in the latter half of December. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President and Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Paul Adler : Thank you, Vanasan. And thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our fiscal 2022 second quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance.  These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'll now turn the call over to Todd. Todd Schneider : Thank you, Paul. Our second quarter financial results were led by a strong revenue increase of 9.4%. Our financial results are indicative of our compelling value proposition, vast total addressable markets, and the outstanding execution of our employee partners. I thank our partners for continuing to navigate these challenging times by focusing on our customers. The benefits of our strong top line growth flowed through to our bottom line. Excluding last year's $18 million pretax gain on the sale of certain operating assets and Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment and the related tax benefits, second quarter operating income margin increased 70 basis points from last year, and EPS grew 16.5%. These results are especially significant given that they were achieved in a period in which U.S. inflation hit a 39-year high. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue was $1.54 billion compared to $1.41 billion last year. Organic revenue growth was 8.5%. The labor market is challenging. However, we are benefiting in the current environment. Businesses are struggling with the scarcity of labor, which has left many understaffed. Also, businesses have a heightened awareness of safety and cleanliness and are concerned with their ability to properly sanitize amid persistent COVID infections. Businesses are increasingly outsourcing to Cintas, so they can focus on their core competencies and be Ready for the Workday.  And it is noteworthy that the U.S. still hasn't recovered about 4 million pre-pandemic jobs, and the job openings totaled about 11 million. Return of jobs represents future revenue growth opportunity for Cintas. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the second quarter was $202.2 million compared to $194.4 million last year. Organic revenue growth was 3.2%. Second quarter revenue was up against a difficult comparison. In last year's second quarter, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, sales of personal protective equipment, or PPE were very high and the business grew organic revenue 14.5%. At that time, PPE comprised an outsized percentage of First Aid and Safety Services revenue mix.  The amount of PPE has declined year-over-year as expected. However, COVID infections are still prevalent and PPE remains a larger percentage of the revenue mix than it was pre-COVID. Over the same period of time, the recurring first aid cabinet service business revenue has increased. In fact, it is up 20% from last year. We welcome this shift in mix because First Aid cabinet service business is a more consistent revenue stream and has higher profit margins than PPE. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $184.9 million compared to $152.1 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue growth rate was 16.9%, and the Uniform Direct Sale business organic growth rate was 47.3%. Both businesses benefited in part from an improved economic environment. Regarding our balance sheet and cash flow, our financial position remained strong. Second quarter operating cash flow increased 27% from last year and free cash flow improved 16%. Recently, on December 15, we paid shareholders $98.5 million in quarterly dividends. The amount per share of common stock paid of $0.95 represents a 26.7% increase over the company's previous quarterly dividend. We continue to allocate capital to improve shareholder return. Now before turning the call over to Mike, I want to highlight that we recently issued our 2021 environmental, social, and governance report. Cintas was founded on a sustainable business model. We are committed to protecting the environment, enhancing humanity, and maintaining accountability.  The report, our second consecutive provides expanded information and data, including our reductions in energy usage, water consumption, and Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Our ESG report further illustrates that our corporate culture based on doing what is right and challenging ourselves to improve is a competitive advantage. I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Hansen : Thank you, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2022 second quarter revenue was $1.92 billion compared to $1.76 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate, adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 9.3%.  Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '22 was $885.1 million compared to $819.9 million last year. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 46% for the second quarter of fiscal '22 compared to 46.7% last year. Gross margin percentage by business was 46.8% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 43.5% for First Aid and Safety Services, 44.6% for Fire Protection services, and 39.1% for Uniform Direct Sale. Energy-related expenses were a headwind, increasing 40 basis points from last year. Also, we made investments in labor to support our strong current and anticipated revenue growth. Selling and administrative expenses improved as a percentage of revenue to 26.2% in the second quarter compared to 26.6% last year, operating income of $381.2 million compared to $352.9 million last year. Operating income margin was 19.8% compared to 20.1% reported last year. Excluding last year's second quarter $18 million gain on sale of certain assets, which were recorded in selling and administrative expenses, this year's second quarter operating income grew 13.8% and operating income margin increased 70 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 18% compared to 13.3% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. In addition, last year's second quarter tax rate included a 370 basis point benefit from the sale of certain assets. Net income for the second quarter was $294.7 million compared to $284.9 million last year. Diluted EPS was $2.76 compared to $2.62 last year. Excluding last year's second quarter gain and the related tax benefits, which impacted diluted EPS by $0.25, this year's second quarter diluted EPS of $2.76 compares to $2.37, an increase of 16.5%. We are increasing our fiscal '22 financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $7.58 billion to $7.6 billion to a range of $7.63 billion to $7.70 billion, and diluted EPS from a range of $10.60 to $10.90 to a range of $10.70 to $10.95. Please note the following regarding our guidance : Fiscal '22 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 19% compared to a rate of 13.7% for fiscal '21. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '22 diluted EPS guidance by about $0.72 and diluted EPS growth by about 700 basis points. Guidance does not include any future share buybacks, and guidance assumes an uneven economic recovery caused by COVID-19. However, guidance does not contemplate significant COVID-19 pandemic-related setbacks such as stay-at-home orders or cost necessary to comply with government COVID-19 mandates. Finally, when modeling our fiscal '22 financial results by quarter, please note that in last fiscal year's third quarter, we were able to help our customers respond to a spike in COVID-19 cases by providing them with various supplies of personal protective equipment, gloves, in particular. We provided more personal protective equipment in that quarter than in any other. Excluding the PPE that we don't expect to repeat, our second half of the year revenue growth guidance is over 9% at the top end of our range. Paul Adler : That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go ahead and take our first question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Manav Patnaik : Thank you very much. I was just hoping you could just address kind of your -- in the near-term visibility more in terms of reactions from your customers with the spread of Omicron, and if you're seeing any change in behaviors or are people just kind of chugging along here? Todd Schneider : Manav, this is Todd. Thanks for your question. Good morning. At this point, our -- we haven't seen a change in our customer base as a result of Omicron. It's a little early to tell, certainly. But nevertheless, it's -- I would say it's business as usual at this point with our customers, and we're looking forward to the back half of the year. Manav Patnaik : Got it. And then maybe just as a follow-up, just tied to the other pressures out there, which is inflation, it sounds like you guys are handling that well. You referred to investments in the labor force. Can you just address what that is and broadly how you feel about managing these inflationary pressures going forward as well? Todd Schneider : Yeah, great question. Inflation is certainly real, but I think we're managing it quite well. We do have a world-class supply chain organization that is a real competitive advantage in these cases. And fortunately, we've been addressing wages over the past couple of years, as we've spoken about in the past calls.  So, we weren't caught flat-footed as it relates to wages. And our -- certainly, our wage increases are still a little above historical, but we're more investing in the infrastructure to be able to service our customers so that based upon our current growth and our anticipated growth, which is -- we're very excited about. Todd Schneider : Thank you. Todd Schneider : Thank you. Operator : We'll go ahead and take our next question from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman : Hi. It's Andrew. If I try to back into the second half operating margins in the full year guide, I get to 19.1%, which is up modestly year-over-year. And I just wanted to make sure that you do the math the same way as maybe you'd kind of go through some of those kind of puts and takes on the second half operating margins. Mike Hansen : Good morning, Andrew. Our -- we would say our implied operating margin guidance for the second half of the year is a little bit higher than what you stated at 19.1%. We think of it closer to the 19.5%. And look, we still expect some very nice operating margin growth for the year, even in the back half of the year and even in an environment which is pretty challenging, as I'm sure you're aware in terms of the inflationary pressures.  But as Todd mentioned, we're managing that inflation. We like the margin improvement, and our expectation is we're going to see better than the 19.1% that you referred to. Andrew Steinerman : And the 19.5% is for the total company, and I assume. And I just wanted to maybe make a comment on increases on the customer side, the B2B increases because you were at a hiatus, now you've [indiscernible] kind of in process of increasing prices to customers and kind of how has that gone? Are they understanding of the inflationary environment? Todd Schneider : I'll take that one, Mike. Thanks for the question, Andrew. Certainly, on the pricing, one of the things that's important to understand is that we don't simply send out a letter increasing prices to all 1 million customers, all at the same time. We address the issue throughout the year. So you'll continue to see that. And also, as we said in the past, pricing is -- it's a local subject. Some industries are still struggling, some are doing quite well. Some geographies are still not back to pre-COVID and others are nicely ahead of the curve. Now inflation is -- it seems like it's in every headline and every time you turn on the news. And as a result, I'd say the conversations with our customers are generally going well and our results are a little bit better than historical in that area as well. But as you know, we take a long-term approach and we focus on the lifetime value of our customers, which, frankly is reflected in our NPS scores being at all-time highs. Now all that being said, in the face of inflation being at a 39-year high, we are growing our operating income and incremental margins at very attractive rates, and we're excited about that. Andrew Steinerman : Right. And then just confirm 19.5% was total company, right? Mike Hansen : Yeah. It was a total company against last year of just under 19%. So again, what we think to be a pretty healthy margin improvement. And let's keep in mind, last year's margins were record margins and 310 basis points higher than pre-pandemic levels, so we like where we're headed with this -- with the margins in the back half of the year. Andrew Steinerman : Well said. Thank you very much. Operator : Okay. We'll go ahead and take our next question from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Mario Cortellacci : Hi. This is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. Just my first question around labor. Maybe you can just update us just not on the labor inflation portion, but also on the labor availability in your business and kind of how you're managing through that?  And then also, maybe you could tie that through to what your pricing strategy looks like regarding that, especially since you guys really haven't taken any price in the past 2 years, I believe it was? Todd Schneider : Yes, Mario. This is Todd. As far as labor availability, we're competing quite well out there. We pay a very competitive wage and very attractive benefits. And we think we're an employer of choice. And that's reflecting in our staffing levels, which we like. It's certainly more challenging this year than in the past in general, but we're competing quite well, and we like that. As far as how we look at the pricing? Again, it's a -- you'll see it throughout the year. And it is something that we look at customer by customer. And because, as I mentioned, it's a local subject. And we do look at the long-term value of the customers. But we have -- we're doing better than historical. And the reason being is because it's -- there's a little bit of wind in your sales as far as customers are highly aware of what's going on with inflation in general and wage pressures as well.  But as a result, we think we're in a good spot. I'm very thankful that we have been addressing wage increases over the past few years because it prevented us from being flat footed coming in and being under real pressure. Mario Cortellacci : Great. And then just for my follow-up. Can you just comment on the Fire business and your strategy for getting into some of the top fire markets that you're not currently in? And do you intend to play in any other adjacencies within the Fire business such as what API Group or other larger players have done in that space? Todd Schneider : Yes, Mario. As far as the Fire business, we're continuing to build out our footprint. We have found that we very much liked our model that we are providing the service levels to customers. And it's showing up very nicely in new business wins and retention, and you're seeing it in the growth. As far as adjacencies, we're always evaluating those, but we think there's incredible run rate in that business with the type of strategy we have today without even going into an adjacency, but we're certainly always evaluating this. Mario Cortellacci : Great. Thank you very much. And I hope you all have a great holiday. Todd Schneider : Thank you. You too. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Your gross margins contracted 80 bps year-over-year in the Uniform Rental segment. Can you elaborate a bit on margin performance there and what your guidance implies for Uniform segment gross margins? Todd Schneider : Certainly, George. This is Todd. I'll start and then Mike can chime in. Gross margin in general, is up 40 basis points due to just energy alone, so that's obviously a headwind. I think gas stand-alone is up 60% year-over-year. But as far as the balance of that, the 70 basis points, we're making investments in the additional employee partners that we need to service the very nice growth that we're seeing along with the growth that we see coming. The revenue now, George, is different -- a little different from last year. It's much closer to our revenue -- our traditional revenue mix. And let me just give you an example because I think it'll maybe help you understand that a little bit better. With PPE last year there was obviously significant demand for that, and we're happy to help our customers with it. But in those cases, in many of the cases with that, they were simply a drop ship to those customers. And when you drop ship, those large quantities, it doesn't take a whole lot of work. It's just a drop ship and then you're able to book the revenue, et cetera. You think of that versus the level of employee partners that is required to service uniforms, facility services, first aid and safety cabinets, it simply takes more work.  However, we welcome this shift as it provides more value to the customers than simply a drop ship. It's stickier business and long-term, they have better margin. So we like it. We like that switch, and we knew that, that was coming, and we've been staffing for it and guiding for it. All that said, as we know inflation is at a 39-year high. As I mentioned, energy is up 40 basis points. Our investment in growth for today and the future. And if you exclude the onetime gain of our operating -- our onetime gain from last year, our operating margins were up 70 basis points and our incremental margins are quite strong.  So we're doing exactly what we had hoped and planned for, I guess, would be the way I would describe it. George Tong : Got it. That's helpful. Your health care and hygiene businesses have seen a boost in demand with COVID. Can you talk about trends and the broader opportunity you're seeing in health care and hygiene? Todd Schneider : Certainly. Health care, they're connected, right? But health care is a vertical, hygiene is subject to across all businesses. So as far as the health care vertical, we're continuing to see strong demand. We like what we're providing with scrubs items to help customers clean patient rooms and other rooms in addition to isolation gowns. So all of that is -- we continue to be very bullish about the health care vertical. As far as hygiene, and I'll lump hygiene with sanitization cleanliness, all of that Health and safety. All of that is -- we believe, has been a see change and something that is going to be wind at our sales maybe forever, right, because of you see the focus that people have on sanitizing, hygiene, health, safety. We think we can see that in certainly our Uniform Rental, Facility Services segment, but also our First Aid business. People are very focused on the health safety and wellness of their people and their customers, of their patients and their guests. And as a result, that's good for us. George Tong : Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. Todd Schneider : Thank you. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Ashish Sabadra with RBC. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on the comments that you made on the health care, but just focus on the larger opportunities across the 3 verticals, health care, government and education vertical. I was wondering if you could comment on the pipelines for those larger opportunities. Thanks. Todd Schneider : Yeah. Ashish, the pipeline looks quite strong for all those verticals. We feel good. Our sales organization is operating at a very high level and we really like our new business wins in that area. Our retention is very attractive. So you look at all that, you say our new business wins are very strong. Our retention is very strong. And we are excited for our customers to get back to full strength as well. And we think that bodes well for the future for us. Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful color. And maybe just talking about technology on the last call, you had talked about the benefits of SAP implementation and more to come. I was wondering if you could talk about what you're doing on the technology front, on the automation front, provide some preview on what we could see over the next few -- next year? And how should that help offset some of the inflationary pressure? Thanks. Todd Schneider : Yeah. Great question. So obviously, investing in technology is 1 of our top priorities because we see the opportunity to improve efficiencies in our business, operational efficiencies, but also provide items that the customers notice and recognize and make it easier to do business with us. Those are things that we're trying to leverage.  I think a good example of technology that we're leveraging is by leveraging SAP and partnering with a communications company. We have launched what we call Smart Truck technology, which collects and analyzes data to create a much more efficient routing structure. So what this allows us to do is to spend more time with the customers instead of -- and reduce fuel expense instead of driving in between stops.  And as we say, we only make money in this business when the wheels stop. When the wheels are moving, that's just expense. So we see that as an opportunity to leverage technology to improve operational efficiencies. We have -- as another example, we have launched a portal for our customers that allows them to do business with us online, which is a competitive advantage in the marketplace.  What we're seeing is contrary to years ago, people don't always want to do business during normal business hours. What they're interested in is doing business on their time. And what we're seeing is the request that we see from our customers is well over half of their requests are outside of normal business hours. So it's making it easier to do business with us. We allow them to make requests changes to their program. We allow them to pay their bills online. All these are items that the customers see as an advantage in the marketplace being easier to do business with, and we get really excited when customers see a technology advantage and find us easier to do business with. Ashish Sabadra : That\u2019s very helpful color. Thank you and happy holidays. Todd Schneider : Thank you. Operator : We'll go ahead and take our next question from Andy Wittmann with Baird. Andy Wittmann : Thanks for taking my question. I guess I just wanted to get a little subjective comments on the new guidance this quarter versus the guidance you gave last quarter. Mike, it kind of looks like the biggest change in the EPS side is just a little bit lower tax rate. On the revenue side, the quarter beat consensus, you don't guide quarterly, but it kind of feels like the fundamental outlook for the revenue and core operating margin for business hasn't materially changed. Is that the right way of looking at it? Or did you see a change in the business fundamentals that you're factoring into the guidance, the updated guidance today? Mike Hansen : Andy, I think that's a fair assessment from the perspective of not a lot of change from what we had been talking about in the last quarter, and that is growth continuing to be pretty strong in the second half of the year. Ex that big PPE number that we've talked about in the third quarter and a little bit in the fourth quarter, our growth would be in excess of 9%. And roughly the same margins we've been talking about for much of the year and that is we certainly expect margin growth and continue to expect margin growth. If we did hit 19.5% that I talked about earlier, that's roughly a 60 basis point improvement in the back half of the year. That's coming on top of, I'll call it gain adjusted 50 basis point improvement in the first half of the year. And you might remember, we talked at the early part of the year at a kind of a 0 to 70 basis point improvement. And the performance through midway through the year is showing that we're right at the top of that initial guide. And so the movement is a little bit of taxes, maybe a little bit of margin improvement. But generally speaking, your assessment is fair, Andy. Pretty nice growth and a healthy margin improvement on record margins from a year ago. Andy Wittmann : Yeah. Okay. Thanks for go into that, Mike. I guess my follow-up question then just you talked -- you just talked now and previously in the call, you talked about these margins, and I think they speak for themselves. But -- and you talked about price being a little bit above average. Are there any other things that are driving margin performance besides just price and then the operating leverage from the business?  Are there actions or other investments that you're making that are helping this margin performance? Or is this kind of just the natural progression of price/cost as well as fixed cost leverage? Todd Schneider : Yeah. Andy, this is Todd. Good question. I think it's the normal operation of the business. We're always investing in various items that help our operational efficiencies. And I mentioned the Smart Truck technology that we think is going to be exciting for us.  But I think it's just the general leverage that we're getting in the face of what is still a very challenging operating environment. And we're, as Mike said, coming off of a record 310 basis point improvement in margin. We're very excited about that, and we're going to continue to take another step forward this year. Mike Hansen : Andy, I might throw it into a couple of different buckets as well and a little bit of reiterating what Todd and I have already talked about that. Look, our growth is at pretty good levels. And when we grow at those pretty good levels, we get some really nice leverage in the business. And we're seeing that leverage as a benefit, productivity improvements. I mean we've -- from our laundry facilities, to our service and route -- the route improvements that Todd has talked about, to sales rep productivity, productivity is strong and continues to improve as we look at process improvement and innovation and automation. And so productivity is very strong. Efficiencies. Look, we made some pretty difficult cost cuts last year, some changes to our cost structure. And we'd rather not give up many of those. And so while we -- while we'll start to see -- we have started to see a little bit of travel, for example, come in, look, we're still managing the cost structure very tightly.  And maybe then the last bucket I'll throw out there is we've talked quite a bit about resuming pricing and pricing is helping a little bit this year. And so margin improvement, I think we can throw it in those 4 buckets. And it's -- I would say it certainly is leading to some pretty good performance even in the face of 40 basis point increases in energy and other certain inflationary factors. Andy Wittmann : Yeah. Great. Thanks for the comprehensive answer guys. Happy holidays. Mike Hansen : You too, Andy. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Unidentified Analyst : This is [indiscernible] filling in for Tim. Thanks for taking questions here. I wanted to hit on margins real quick again. In the Uniform Rental segment, operating margin was down year-over-year, but still very strong relative to historical standards. Is that kind of how we should think about this segment's margin structure from a long-term perspective, maybe down year-over-year because of higher cost inflation, but capable of maintaining '21 margins in a more normalized environment? Mike Hansen : Well, a couple of points that I might make. First of all, we talked a little bit about the gain on the sale of assets from a year ago. And so if you take that, that was all recorded in SG&A within rental. If you take out the impact of that gain, last year's second quarter was 21.1% compared to our 22% this year. So a 90 basis point improvement. So some pretty healthy year-over-year improvement. Look, we've been in the rental business above 20% for the last 6 quarters. And our expectation is we're going to see a little bit -- because this is such a challenging environment, we're going to see some ups and downs periodically, but generally speaking, look, we like where the business is running in that rental segment. And our expectation is we'll stay above that 20% number. Unidentified Analyst : Excellent. Maybe switching gears back to the PPE. Earlier in the year, I think you expected a PPE headwind of about 1% in fiscal 2022. It sounds like maybe that expectation could be changing a bit. Can you just update us on what you think the PPE headwind will be for fiscal 2022 here? Mike Hansen : Well, I think if you take a look at our guidance, for example, for the back half of the year. I believe the -- at the high end, the revenue growth is 7.4% over last year. So if you think about the comment we made of growth being 9% we're talking about 160 basis points in the back half of the year.  So you can think about 80 basis points for the full year. So I would say we're not far from where we talked about early on in the year, but certainly, it's back-end loaded a little bit more. Unidentified Analyst : Got you. Thanks for the color. Thanks. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. Wanted to ask an ESG-related question. Given the size of your fleet, a shift to electric vehicles seems like it would be pretty meaningful. And so I know in your ESG report, you indicated that by January, you expect to deploy 12 electric vehicles. And so just curious if this programs been initiated? And if you could talk about how we should think about the potential of rolling out this to the entire fleet? Todd Schneider : Yeah. Toni, this is Todd. Thank you for the question. So yes, we're excited about electrifying the fleet. We are right on schedule as far as what we plan for testing. We have a diverse fleet because of the various types of trucks we have, the rental trucks, the first aid trucks and the fire trucks as well.  But we're working with some very large manufacturers at very high levels, and we're excited about the future as it relates to that. We think that, that is something that's important to our customers, and it's important to our partners and our employee partners, and we think it will be very important to shareholders as well.  So we believe that getting out ahead of this curve is important to us, and we're committed to doing so and dealing with all the challenges that are associated with that -- with the weight of the vehicles that we operate, the size of our fleet and also getting access to the supply, which is why we're working with a diverse group and at high levels. So that way, we're in a good position as an organization. Toni Kaplan : That's helpful. And one question I've been getting recently is around the ability for you to do large-scale M&A. And some skepticism around that. Do you think that's valid or because of the fragmented market, there's still potential for you to be able to do a large deal? And I'd also say it maybe seems a little harder for deals to get done right now or at least longer to get approved. So just wanted to hear your thoughts around large-scale M&A. Todd Schneider : Yes, Toni. So just as a reminder, M&A is our second priority of capital use right behind investing in our business. And we're excited about M&A of all shapes and sizes. We're blessed to have a market that is massive in size, meaning, if you think about how many people are wearing -- garments were in uniforms out in the marketplace, it is a significant market. And that's representative of our new business wins that we have. So about two thirds of our -- the new accounts that we bring in are all people that -- are customers that are what we call no programs. Some people in different industry call the unvended. Nevertheless, when we walk in, they don't have a uniform program and when they walk out, we do. It's a little bit more complicated than that, but that net-net. That being said, that's simply the uniform market.  Our other markets are just a vast addressable market, whether it's facility services and all the headwind -- or excuse me, all the tailwinds that are behind that business from health, safety, sanitation, hygiene. Same way with the First Aid business. And in the Fire business, we see it is obviously a massive market just simply because everybody is required by law to have those products and services.  So yeah, I think we're an incredibly good position in all those because of the market size. That leads us to -- we think we're interested in M&A in all of our businesses and are excited about the potential of M&A of small, medium and large because we think the market is such that it is absolutely appropriate. Toni Kaplan : Very helpful. Happy holidays. Thank you. Todd Schneider : Thank you. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. Good morning. I'm curious -- this is a question of your average customer in First Aid. Pre-pandemic, what would their cabinet look like? How much has it changed of the items or the contents inside to what it looks like now to the level of detail you can speak to that?  And then how has the pricing and margin profile change of that cabinet? I assume better, but anything you can share on that? And then I'll have a quick follow-up. Thanks. Todd Schneider : Okay, Scott. This is Todd. As far as our cabinet, we're constantly bringing out new products for our First Aid cabinet and that is an important component of that business. We offer other services in that business, whether it be AEDs, training and compliance as well as eyewash stations, which are required by OSHA to be serviced appropriately. So all of that is -- we're seeing a return back to a focus on that with our customers, which is exciting to us.  As far as the cabinet itself, besides the new products that we have launched, it's pretty well a traditional type of situation. Now what is changing is the focus on health and safety of employees, customers, guest, patients, those types of things. And as a result, we think that's good for the First Aid business.  And as we've spoken about, the First Aid cabinet business is more predictable, provides more value to the customer than a drop ship type of PPE and is more profitable. So I think as you see that trend of the health and safety continuing and as more people are back to work, then that's going to be very positive for that business. Mike Hansen : I might add a couple of things. Just reminding you, Scott, that I think Todd mentioned that First Aid cabinet business is up 20% year-over-year in our second quarter. So we really do like the momentum of it. But we're not quite back to the mix of pre-pandemic, but we certainly like the movement towards that mix. And when we think about the gross margin in this business, the material cost really has improved. What you're seeing in this particular quarter is that we're spending a little bit of that improvement on some of the labor investments that Todd talked about in terms of building the service capacity, both for the current growth that we've had, but also for anticipated second half of the year growth.  So really nice performance by our First Aid and Safety partners and the performance is improving just like we expected it to and just like we wanted to. Scott Schneeberger : Great. Thanks. I appreciate all that color. And the follow-up is on the same subject. You guys are running below what were pre-pandemic peak First Aid and Safety margins. Do you think within a matter of a year or 2, you can get back to the higher level? And why or why not? Thank you. Todd Schneider : Yes, Scott, this is Todd. So we're very focused on that. We think that revenue mix will be very positive for us. And we also look at the -- as I mentioned, the win behind our sales and the focus on health and wellness of folks out in the marketplace is going to be positive.  So as we continue to focus on that area, net revenue mix rebalances, then I think you're going to see a nice trend towards more traditional tech margins in that business. Scott Schneeberger : Great. Appreciate guys. Happy holidays. Todd Schneider : Thank you, Scott. You too. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey, Todd, I wanted to ask you a little bit on the competitive environment. Aramark has been trying to execute a turnaround for the last couple of years. I want to know if does that make a difference to you guys in the market at all. Have you seen a change in terms of competitiveness or in terms that you guys have to be more competitive? Or is the market so fragmented that a change like that wouldn't necessarily filter back to you guys? Todd Schneider : Shlomo, thanks for the question. It's a good question. The operating environment we're in, it's always competitive. Nothing noteworthy though, I would say, in the change. Our revenue retention rates are very strong. And as I mentioned, our new business wins are very strong as well. And they're coming from those new programmers much more so than the competition. And I just think it speaks to the vast market out there that we're focused on providing that value to the customers.  When we walk in, and I'll just give uniforms an example. When we walk in 1 of the top areas -- type of things we hear back from customers is, wow, I didn't know you could do all that for what you do it for. So they're surprised. One of the other items that we hear is we didn't know that you would be able to service a customer of our size. They might have 10 wearers. And that is something that like an average-sized customer for us, but the perception is, you have to have 100 people, 1,000 people. So we're attacking that market because we see that the customer sees value in what we provide. And there are also -- there's a little certainly wind behind our sales on it's tough to attract talent right now.  So being able to provide a service like this is something that's attractive to people. And you think about how many people are working out in the marketplace and the fact that we can provide that service to tens of millions of more wearers. It's very exciting for the future. And so as a result of how we focus on it, it really -- those competitive pressures, we're more focused on retaining our customers, and we're more focused on growing the market and because it's just so massive. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Great. And then maybe this is one for Mike. Just kind of in the other segments, I know there's definitely volatility quarter-over-quarter in terms of the margins just comparing the operating margin this quarter versus the last couple of quarters. And is there something besides -- sequentially, obviously, it's a lower revenue, which make a difference in the margin going back a couple of quarters. Could you just give us some of the puts and takes of what's impacting the operating margin? Mike Hansen : Shlomo, when you look at Q2 compared to Q1 keep in mind that we referred in the first quarter call to a gain on sale of some assets. So in that -- in the first quarter, there was a $12.1 million gain. So we had a little bit of an anomaly in that particular quarter.  I'd say this. The Fire business has been performing very, very nicely. And we've seen organic growth this quarter of 16.9% and remains healthy. And some of the things that Todd and I have talked about with the first Aid businesses going on in the Fire business in that we are certainly seeing some great growth. And we're investing for both current -- for that current growth but also for anticipated growth. So we're seeing a little bit of the investment there. And then as you know, Shlomo, the Uniform Direct Sale business can be quite bumpy. And so there's going to be more volatility from quarter-to-quarter in this business. But I'd say this as well, 11.7% for the All Other segment is still a pretty good quarter on a 65-day workday quarter relative to pre-pandemic. So again, just like the other businesses, we like the momentum in these businesses and we like the performance. Shlomo Rosenbaum : You see that extra day versus, say, 4Q '21 is a bigger impact? And just trying to get a little bit more detail completely appreciate the volatility in the Uniform Direct business? Mike Hansen : The direct -- I would say that the day is more of an impact to the Fire business than it is the Uniform Direct sale. The Uniform Direct sale tends to be bumpy based on -- could be a rollout of a new program. It's just timing of the sales within those current customer programs. That's the biggest volatility item within the Uniform Direct sale. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Great. Thank you. Operator : All right. It appears there are no more questions at this time. Mr. Adler, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Paul Adler : Okay. Well, thank you for joining us this morning, everyone. We will issue our third quarter fiscal '22 financial results in March. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President and Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Paul F. Adler: Thank you, Sergei. And thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our fiscal 2022 third quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'll now turn the call over to Todd. Todd M. Schneider: Thank you Paul. Our third quarter financial results are led by a strong revenue increase of 10.3%. The benefits of our strong top line growth flowed through to our bottom line. Excluding the onetime gain recorded in this year\u2019s third quarter of selling and administrative expenses, operating income margin increased 90 basis points from 18.4% to 19.3% and EPS grew 13.5% from $2.37 to $2.69. Our financial results are indicative of our compelling value proposition. Businesses prioritize all we provide including image, cleanliness, safety, and compliance. And challenge with labor scarcity and rising costs businesses increasingly turn to Cintas to help them get ready for the workday. I'm especially pleased with our financial results because they were achieved in a period in which U.S. inflation hit a 40 year high. Inflation is high and broad and one need not look any further than the corner gas station to see it. We've been able to navigate this challenging time and delivered increased operating margins and EPS by productively starting new business, penetrating existing customers with more products and services, providing excellent service while driving operational efficiencies, and obtaining incremental price increases from our customer base. As we grow via new business we achieve operating leverage, better negotiating leverage with suppliers, denser routes, and more volume on our plants. As we penetrate existing customers we realize even stronger incremental operating margins. I thank our employees whom we call partners for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders, and each other.  Turning now to our business units, the uniform rental and facility services operating segment revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was $1.55 billion compared to $1.42 billion last year. Organic revenue growth was 8.9%. Our news vertical strategies of healthcare, education, and state and local government continue to post leading revenue growth rates. However, there are opportunities for us in all verticals. Businesses in all sectors are struggling to fill open positions. There are about 11 million job openings in the U.S. alone. Businesses remain concerned with their ability to properly sanitized even as COVID infections decreased. Additionally, businesses are shedding non-core competencies to reduce costs and minimize the impacts of inflation. For these reasons and others, businesses are increasingly outsourcing to Cintas.  Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the third quarter was $213.0 million compared to $198.5 million last year. Organic revenue growth was 6.2% which is a nice improvement from last quarter's 3.2%. This improvement reflects the growing momentum of our First Aid cabinet business which grew 22% in the third quarter. We welcome this mixed shift because it is a more consistent revenue stream and has higher profit margins.  Third quarter revenue growth improved despite a difficult comparison. And last year's third quarter in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, sales of personal protective equipment or PPE were very high and the business grew organic revenue of 17.7%. At that time PPE comprised an outsized percentage of First Aid and Safety Services revenue mix. The amount of PPE has declined year-over-year as expected, however, COVID infections are still prevalent. In fact, we sold about $15 million in a new product which is COVID test kits in this year\u2019s third quarter. PPE remains a larger percentage of the revenue mix than it was pre-COVID.  Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $194.3 million compared to $160.7 million last year. The fire business organic revenue growth rate was 15.3% and Uniform Direct Sale business organic growth rate was 48.7%. Both businesses have bounced back as expected.  I'd like to comment on another one of our strengths namely cash flow. Third quarter operating cash flow increased 18.5% from last year. In this year's third quarter $105 million was used for acquisitions. On March 15th, we paid shareholders $99 million in quarterly dividends. And during the quarter and through March 22, 2022 Cintas purchased $584.2 million of Cintas common stock under our buyback program. We continue to allocate capital in many ways to improve shareholder return. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow enable us to do so consistently.  Finally, I want to share some great news on our technology front. Our ERP provider SAP extended membership in their Strategic Customer Program to Cintas. This is an exclusive program. Only 1% of SAP's customers have membership in it. Inclusion in the program enables us to engage directly with top management of SAP and gain access to its developers and new technologies to realize valuable outcomes for our customers, suppliers, and employees. This program will speed the pace of our transformation into a more data dynamic and process efficient business. I'll now turn the call over to Mike. J. Michael Hansen : Thanks, Todd. Our fiscal 2022 third quarter revenue was $1.96 billion compared to $1.78 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 10%. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was $898.2 million, compared to $809.5 million last year. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 45.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2022, compared to 45.6% last year, an increase of 20 basis points. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas, and electricity were a headwind, increasing 45 basis points from last year. Gross margin percentage by business was 46.3% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 44.2% for First Aid and Safety Services, 46.6% for Fire Protection Services, and 37.7% for Uniform Direct Sale. Operating income of $407.6 million compared to $326.5 million last year. Operating income margin was 20.8% compared to 18.4% reported last year. Fiscal 2022 third quarter operating income included a $30.2 million gain on the acquisition of an entity -- of an equity method investment. The gain was recorded in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment's selling and administrative expenses. Excluding this gain, fiscal 2022 third quarter operating income, as a percentage of revenue, was 19.3%, an increase of 90 basis points from last year's third quarter. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 18.2% compared to 14.4% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. This year's third quarter equity method investment transaction included a significant tax benefit. Excluding the transaction, the effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was 19.6%. Net income for the third quarter was $315.4 million, compared to $258.4 million last year. Diluted EPS was $2.97 compared to $2.37 last year. Fiscal 2022 third quarter diluted EPS contained $0.28 from the gain on the equity method investment transaction, which included a related $0.07 tax rate benefit. Excluding this gain and the related tax impact, fiscal 2022 third quarter diluted EPS was $2.69 compared to $2.37 and in last year's third quarter, a 13.5% increase. We're increasing our financial guidance. We expect our fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $1.96 billion to $2.02 billion and diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.54 to $2.74. Our fourth quarter fiscal 2022 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23.2% compared to a rate of 19.4% for last year's fourth quarter. The expected higher effective tax rate is anticipated to negatively impact fiscal 2022 fourth quarter diluted EPS guidance by approximately $0.14 and diluted EPS growth by approximately 560 basis points. Our financial guidance includes share buybacks through March 22nd, but does not include the impact of any future share buybacks. Finally, I wanted to provide an update on our debt and liquidity. We have $650 million of senior notes maturing April 1st, 2022, and $300 million of senior notes maturing June 1st, 2022. We expect to refinance these amounts with funds received via the issuance of new senior debt. Also, we closed today on a new credit facility, increasing it to $2 billion and extending it to 2027. We have a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity. I'll turn it over to Paul, now. Paul F. Adler: That concludes our prepared remarks. Now, we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Andrew Steinerman from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Alexander Hess : Hi, this is Alex Hess on for Andrew Steinerman today. I wanted to touch briefly on what you guys are seeing at the vertical level, maybe with respect to a rebound and a potential rebound in hospitality or is that -- was that still being dragged in your last quarter from Omicron and then maybe, also, progress maybe, in driving adoption in healthcare, any comments on those two fronts? Thanks guys. Todd M. Schneider: Sure, Alex. Thanks for the question. Our vertical strategy is working quite well. You mentioned the hospitality sector, it is certainly bouncing back. If you -- what you read in the news, bookings are up in the airlines and the hospitality sector. So yes, so that's bouncing back. And I think the results in our direct sales business, which is in large part tied to -- certainly, to a percentage tied to the hospitality area, the results are outstanding. So -- but in our other verticals, we're having very good success in each of those. And in the healthcare, specifically, we see a -- we're very much in the early innings but we have products and services that are compelling to that customer base. And we're continuing to evolve and create new products and new technologies that we're integrating there. So as a result, we're very bullish on our strategy in that area, with our focus in that area, and I think the results are reflective. Alexander Hess : Thank you. Operator : Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hamzah Mazari : Hey, good morning. You had referenced penetrating more customers as part of strong incrementals, specifically as it relates to that, do you have a sense of how many customers today are buying more than one service from you, has that changed at all due to having SAP? What was that same number pre-pandemic just so we can get a sense of that initiative? Todd M. Schneider: Yes. Hamzah, certainly being virtually on one system now, it is certainly helping our transparency into cross-selling. What I'll tell you is, again, we're in the early innings of cross-sell. There is a -- our ability to add product, we have a really long runway in that area. Just to get to even a reasonable level of penetration, where we feel excited about it, there is a long, long runway to penetrating our customers with our existing products separate from what we're going to bring into the marketplace in the future, which is we're always working on new products and services. So we feel good about that. So it's certainly improving, but very much in the early innings of that -- on that subject. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. And just my follow-up question, I'll turn it over, it is just, around M&A, any updated thoughts as to the pipeline there or have valuations come in at all, I know you've talked about historically, that M&A doesn't necessarily mean it has to be route-based, just walk us through that as well, the rationale there? Thank you. Todd M. Schneider: Sure, Hamzah. We -- as we noted, M&A was good in the third quarter of our -- the investment we've made in acquiring businesses. We're highly acquisitive. The pipeline looks attractive. It takes different reasons for different companies to transact. You can't always predict that timing, but we are very much a willing buyer and of all shapes and sizes. We're very, very acquisitive and interested in making deals. So we're ready, willing, and able to continue to move forward in that area. J. Michael Hansen : Yes. Hamzah, we -- as you heard Todd mention, our third quarter included an overall acquisition number of $105 million, which is certainly a step up from where we've been. Now, included in that is the purchase of the remaining shares of the equity method investment, which was about $48 million within that number. But the rest of the M&A of $57 million is still a step-up from where we've been. So there has been some good movement this entire fiscal year, and we like the messaging that we're getting. We like the pipeline and as you can see so far this year, we've acted on many of those. Hamzah Mazari : Got it, very helpful. Thank you. Operator : George Tong, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. George Tong : Hi, thanks, good morning. Can you discuss how the business is being impacted by rising input costs, including wage inflation and higher energy costs? And how effectively pricing trends are offsetting this? Todd M. Schneider: Good morning George. Thanks for the question. Certainly, expected that inflation and input costs would be something that we would want to be talking about. So we have -- so I have a few examples I'd like to talk about regarding items that we are -- steps that we're taking to mitigate input costs. But inflation is -- yes, it's certainly challenging. It's very much there. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, whether it's fuel or other areas, input costs are real. But we're being very active in taking steps to make sure that we are mitigating that type of exposure. You mentioned pricing, so certainly pricing is a component of our strategy, but it is -- by no means is it the only strategy to combat pricing -- or excuse me, to combat inflation. So we're taking other steps and they almost all involve technology. And these were all initiatives that we have been working on. However, due to the inflation subject, we decided to pull them forward and go faster with them. And individually, they are not massive movers, but collectively they certainly add up. So I'll go through a few of those that I think might help provide a little color.  First off, I mentioned in, I think, our last call, that we have invested in routing technology that is proprietary and really fits our business well. And as long as I've been with the company, it seems like we have tried about every routing software out there, and we finally said we're going to build it ourselves. We're going to do it. It's going to fit with SAP, and it will be -- because we have a unique routing structure, so we did that. And I'm very thankful that over the past couple of years, we've invested in that technology. We've rolled out across the organization, and we're executing on it. Now, we -- very important, right, we recognize that we only generate revenue when the truck stops. When it stops at our customers' place of business, that's when we can generate revenue. So we've got to be more efficient. And I'm really pleased with that investment. Certainly, it takes time. There's -- we are very conscious of any customer disruption, but we're trying to go faster with that subject. And again, we're blessed that we made the investment. And if we didn't have it, then it would put much more pressure on the organization with the inflation subject. So again, very pleased that we have that. We've also, from a technology standpoint, we invested in some in automation. We now have three different processes for how to implement automation into our uniform processing facilities. And this provides us flexibility we didn't have in the past. That flexibility is, meaning we can deploy one of those based upon a number of factors really gets into the footprint of the facility and the number of pieces going through. But we've pivoted on this subject as well to go faster, because of what's going on with labor costs, certainly. So we're able to automate our facilities in a sped-up fashion. And then I've got a couple of others that I'll talk about. We now -- we've invested in technology through SAP that allows us to have a centralized dashboard and look at all of our rental processing facilities and understand how they're operating on a daily basis, a real-time basis from an efficiency and effectiveness standpoint. So in the past, we had to go physically see these facilities to understand if they're operating in the manner that we expect. But now, we have this real-time dashboard and it allows us to know how we're doing. And as a result, there's more accountability, and we're getting better. That allows us to improve the efficiencies within our business. And I've got a few others, but one other I'll give you is we are -- because of the technology we have with SAP now, we're seeing a real nice impact in our ability to share our used inventory of garments across all of our locations. This is due to our stock rooms, which is where we house our used inventory at each of our locations having real-time inventory tracking and all being on that same system of SAP. So what it allows us to do is to gain better use of the inventory that was in the past, dedicated solely to the individual locations customer base. Now, we can spread it out across a much larger customer base. And we -- and it also allows us with, nonstock sizes, to look at where the product is and get it faster to our customers. So I could go on, but hopefully, that gives you a few examples of items that -- proactive steps that we are taking to mitigate the inflation. Because, again, as I mentioned, it's real, it's challenging, but I'm highly confident that the organization will be able to manage through this as we have in the past. George Tong : That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, could you provide a brief update on how your customer base is being affected by supply chain disruptions and the flow-through impact on demand for Cintas' services? Todd M. Schneider: Yes. Certainly, George, our customers aren't being impacted by supply chain that's slowing them a bit. But -- and we care passionately about how our customers are, their business are doing, because it obviously has a dynamic impact on us. But as I mentioned earlier, the challenges that our customers are facing was staffing and labor costs. They're looking for ways to outsource and we're beneficiaries of that. We are certainly excited about supply chain issues abating and our customers being able to go even faster, but to date, that's a bit of a headwind, but we have the tailwind of the outsourcing and the benefits we're seeing there. George Tong : Very helpful, thank you. Operator : Ashish Sabadra, RBC. Please go ahead. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question and thanks for providing that detailed color on the technology front. I was wondering if you could also talk about how technology is helping you more on the dynamic pricing and more like local pricing, can you just quote on further just on the pricing trend what the normalized pricing has been historically, and how are we thinking about pricing here, particularly in the inflationary environment and the response to your -- by your customer to maybe, potentially, higher price? Thanks. Todd M. Schneider: Thanks, Ashish for the question. I'll start, if Mike wants to contribute as well. We -- certainly, we -- again, being on one technology platform gives us the ability to use large amounts of data to analyze. And -- but pricing is -- it's a local subject. It's a customer-by-customer subject, industry by industry. But it does give us -- the technology, does give us the ability to look more strategically at our customer base to make sure we're making really good long-term decisions. So we feel good about that. We've had that in place, and we've taken that approach over the past couple of years, and we'll continue that approach and make sure that we're not just making sweeping decisions, but they're more targeted decisions that are more strategic. J. Michael Hansen : Maybe, I'll simply add, certainly, with all of the inflation in the news, the customers are -- it's a little bit of an easier conversation today than it might be otherwise. And so our customers have generally been receptive to that, and that results in a little bit of a higher pricing impact than in the past. And so we've talked a lot about 0% to 2% in the past, and we're a little bit above that today. And so that certainly is one way for us to fight inflation. Todd M. Schneider: Great, Mike. Thank you. But just to point out, clearly, the majority of our growth is coming from more volume growth not pricing, and it is due to the value that we're adding to customers and new business that we're selling, ads and penetrating our customer base, that's where the majority of our growth is coming from, clearly. J. Michael Hansen : I just want to conclude the thought with going back to Ashish to the technology. I think sometimes, it's hard for people to understand the magnitude of the transactions in this business. One of our General Managers of our operations, just one operation, I mean, they can have 5,000 customers. And so the ability to have the technology, as Todd spoke to, and seize upon that to be able to supplement the GM's ability to analyze 5,000 customers to ensure that the pricing is where it needs to be or to see trends in the data to understand if there are customers that are kind of comparing back, reducing services over time, that's a jeopardy account. I, the General manager need to get in front of that particular customer, those are the types of advantages that the technology provides, because it is just such a luminous business and that technology and the additional eyes and that intelligence is certainly a huge competitive advantage. Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful color. And maybe, if I can just ask, I'm not sure if you have quantified how big energy is as a percentage of overall expenses but also, my question is more longer-term. How are you thinking about improving the energy efficiency of the business, both on the truck side, but also on the laundry facilities front? Thank you. J. Michael Hansen : Sure, Ashish. The third quarter total energy for the business was 2.3% of sales. In our guidance side certainly, the gas price has escalated as we got into February, and we're thinking more in terms of 2.6% to 2.8% in our fourth quarter. So certainly, we're going to see a little bit of our expectation is we'll see a little bit of an increase. Just to give you a little bit of maybe, an impact of what we have already done to be more energy efficient, if you go back to the last time we saw prices at the pump at this kind of level was back in calendar 2014. And if you think about the third quarter of our calendar 2014, we were certainly a smaller company, but our total energy at that time was 3% of revenue. So at the same price in the pump, we've been able to reduce our energy by almost a third and from 3% to 2.3%. So we've made some really good progress and we've talked about some of those things. Some of it is certainly scale and growth, but as Todd has talked about, some of it is also the routing efficiency, the penetration that allows us to park the truck a little bit longer.  So we've made some really nice progress over the last several number of years. And how do we think about it going forward, we certainly are going to continue to work at routing efficiency, penetration, but also, certainly, we've talked a little bit about getting electric vehicles on to the road and that has started. And our expectation is we'll put many, many more of those as we move towards our goal of net zero in 2050. So there's a lot more to come in this type of space and we're in the early, early part of exploring that alternative fuel vehicles, but we certainly think that's a big part of our future. Todd M. Schneider: Ashish, in addition, I mentioned earlier about the centralized dashboard that allows us to understand how our locations are functioning, at what level of efficiency. That speaks directly to energy usage in our production facilities. So the more efficient we are, the lower the consumption of the energy, certainly, per pound, specifically. And then, I didn't mention, but we have also, over the past couple of years, we've invested in converting all of our locations to LED lighting, which helps in our ESG journey, but it helps with the consumption of energy and helps reduce some cost. So it's also a cost mitigation subject. So -- and we're looking at other items in that area to reduce energy consumption in our production facility. Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful color and congrats on the solid results. Operator : Andy Wittmann, R.W. Baird. Please go ahead. Andrew Wittmann : Hey thanks. Let's just keep going on this path, I guess. Mike, just when kind of using your EPS and your revenue guidance, I'm backing into fourth quarter margin guidance, which is at the midpoint about flat year-over-year. I think that's probably right, and you can comment on that, I suppose. But you just mentioned that energy prices on a sequential basis, maybe, like 40 basis points. I was wondering if the third quarter was plus 90 basis points adjusted on the margin improvements, you got 40 in energy, what's the other 50? And can you talk about some of the other puts and takes that drive you to that margin -- implied margin guidance? J. Michael Hansen : Yes. I would -- let's start with the implied margin guidance. The range that we see is something like 18.5% at the bottom to 20% at the top. So last year's fourth quarter was 19.4%. So you're right, at the midpoint, it's somewhat flattish against, let's call it, a 60 to 80-point energy headwind from a year ago. And at the top of that range, it's margin expansion even in this period of time. So our goal will be to continue to drive towards margin expansion even in a pretty difficult environment. So getting back to, I think, your question of why, maybe, not more margin expansion. First of all, I would say, look, Andy, I don't know how many companies are expanding margins in this kind of environment, but we intend to. But we also are growing quite nicely. And you've seen our growth move from organically, 8.6% in total in the first quarter to 9.3% to 10%. And growth means for us, when we're growing that volumes, we are investing in things like capacity in our wash alleys and other places. We're investing in -- even when we talk about the route efficiency that doesn't mean we're necessarily not adding routes. And so we're going to continue to invest in our routes. We're going to continue to invest in other customer-facing positions. And so we're going to continue to invest even in this kind of environment, because the growth is very, very good and strong. So that comes with a little bit of a cost too. But gosh, Andy, in this kind of environment, we're looking at a 60 to 80-point -- basis point energy headwind to guide towards margin expansion, we feel pretty good about. Andrew Wittmann : Yes, I wasn't trying to imply otherwise. Could you comment specifically on the labor market, are your positions filled today, are you having enough people to do what you need them to do, and can you talk about the overall pricing trends on that category, specifically? Todd M. Schneider: Andy, we always have job postings, openings, we're growing. And as I mentioned earlier, we're growing our volume very attractively. So there's more work and we're really pleased about that. So -- and the labor market is challenging, trying to get the levels that we're at. We're running at higher RPMs to get there, not speaking of when I say higher RPMs, our management team is working harder to get there. But we like our staffing levels and we will continue to plan to invest in that area. We like our productivity that we're seeing from our partners in all areas of our business. And I think that speaks in large part to our culture, where our folks are -- they get up earlier, they work harder, they work later. And as a result, we have a strategic competitive advantage in the marketplace as a result of that. But yes, we're conscious of -- we're trying to add roles, and we're doing it quite successfully. It's never good enough, as you know, from a leadership standpoint, that we're focused on. Andrew Wittmann : Thanks. Operator : Tim Mulrooney, William Blair. Please go ahead. Timothy Mulrooney : Yeah, good morning. I wanted to go back to pricing for a second. If your uniform contracts are typically several years in length, can you talk about the actual mechanics around how you adjust for pricing, are there annual pricing conversations stipulated within the contract or do you just kind of reach out to customers as needed when you hit certain inflationary thresholds? And are there inflation pass-through provisions in these contracts? Thank you. Todd M. Schneider: Tim, thanks for the question. We have a million customers or more. So the answer is you name it, we've got it. But generally, what I'll speak to is our agreements allow us to raise price and raise price as appropriate. And when we do so, our approach is we do that once a year. It doesn't mean that they all happen on the same day. They may be spread out throughout the year, but the conversation is once a year with the customer. And we have found that, that is -- our commitment to our customers is to handle it in that manner. They like that. Our partners like that. And in these inflationary times, as Mike mentioned earlier, those conversations are going better than they normally have. And they are, just because inflation is front and center of everything, every newspaper that I look at. But our approach is once a year with the customer, and we've been sticking by that, and we plan to continue to stick by that commitment to them. Timothy Mulrooney : Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you. Operator : Manav Patnaik, Barclays. Please go ahead. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on the labor environment broadly, it sounds like you're managing your own labor pretty well. But just curious what you can share in terms of the challenges, struggles, openings, turnover, etcetera that your customers are facing and how that's looking today? Todd M. Schneider: Manav, certainly we are seeing a higher level, we call it a churn, through our customer base. Meaning, we see people that -- one customer and they end up at the other customer and that is at a higher level than it has been in the past. But nevertheless, we like the trend that we're seeing with our customer base and the ad stops trends that we're seeing. That's positive. And just as I mentioned, it seems like it's harder for businesses right now. Everybody is having to work a little bit more at it and productivity has to be a little bit better, but we are certainly seeing more churn of our -- within our customer base than we did, historically. Manav Patnaik : Got it. And Mike, maybe, just for the fourth quarter, there's some tough comps on the rental side and then the fire side as well, I believe. If you could just help us with maybe the sequential organic growth trends we should be thinking about, what the M&A contribution is maybe? J. Michael Hansen : Sure. When we think about organic growth for the rental division, we were at 8.9%. Our expectation -- and so first of all, Manav, let me maybe step back. The guidance for us implies 6.8% to 10% growth, slightly over 10% growth. So we love the momentum of the rental business, and we think that's going to continue to perform very, very well in those upper single-digit type ranges. First Aid and Safety is going to rebound quite a bit in the fourth quarter due to great momentum, but also, a little bit of an easier comp. And we expect that to be in the mid-teens. Our fire business, which grew organically 15.3% this quarter, we continue to expect a very good growth in that area. And then, our Uniform Direct Sale business is going to face a tougher comp. And likely, that's going to come back to something more normalized low to mid-single digits. Did I get -- I'm not sure if I heard the second part of your question, if there was one, Manav. Manav Patnaik : Yes, it was just around given all the M&A. I guess, you picked up on what that quality contribution would look like. J. Michael Hansen : Got it. Yes, yes. So I think I covered that. Maybe, I'll touch on, we talked about -- I talked about the M&A and a big component of that M&A was this equity investment transaction. That is we have got into a joint venture years ago for primarily, the purposes of product innovation and particularly, within our Facility Services business. But that's a component. That entity, which we decided made sense to wholly own now is going to tuck into our global supply chain. So it's relatively non-revenue producing. And so we won't see much of an impact on that. It tucks in the global supply chain. Manav Patnaik : Got it, thank you. Operator : Heather Balsky, Bank of America. Please go ahead. Heather Balsky : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to just touch on and clarify some stuff on the PPE side. Just curious where you guys are relative to 2019 levels at this point, are you still above, or are you -- have you gotten back to kind of a more normalized trend? And then you mentioned sales of COVID tests during the quarter, how you're thinking about that business going forward and is there an inventory investment around that as well? Thank you. J. Michael Hansen : Yes. Our personal protective equipment sales have still been above pre-pandemic levels. We like -- we've talked a little bit throughout here about the value that our customers are seeing in it. And we are certainly recognizing that they still value safety, cleanliness and sanitizing. And so those revenue streams are still above pre-pandemic levels. It's hard to predict what those are going to look like into the future, but they're certainly above pre-pandemic. And the value proposition is being -- is resonating certainly, more today than it did pre-pandemic. So we like the movement in that business and so far, the staying power of that. From a test kit perspective, as we've done throughout this pandemic, our goal has been to do our best to take care of our customers. And in this particular quarter with Omicron really rising, our customers were asking us for the test kit opportunities, and we were able to fulfill those. It did not come with an inventory requirement. Our expectation is that's not going to be big mover into the future. We called out about $15 million worth, that's something that we wouldn't typically expect to repeat at anything close to that level. Heather Balsky : Thank you. And just a follow-up on the PPE side, just because I recall, it's a lower margin business. Is that -- even though it's still elevated, is it declining, do you see it as a tailwind to your margins going as it sort of levels off going into the next quarter and into next year as well? J. Michael Hansen : The short answer is yes, Heather, and I'll maybe, talk about it this way. The First Aid and Safety business where a lot of that PP&E has been, we've seen some really nice momentum in the First Aid side of the business. And that generally comes with those better margins. And we saw a nice uptick from our second quarter to our third quarter in our First Aid and Safety gross margins. And our expectation is that momentum is going to continue even though we still certainly hope that there is more PPE going forward than pre-pandemic. But you're right, Heather. As the mix tilts back to a greater amount of First Aid business, we expect those gross margins to start to get closer and closer towards those pre-pandemic levels. But the one thing I will say in the First Aid and Safety businesses are, we made a nice jump in our operating margin too. And if you think about the SG&A part of that business, we -- our salespeople are producing at very, very high levels and our SG&A in that business is well below pre-pandemic levels. And so as we continue this mix moving in the right direction, our expectation is that those overall operating margins will certainly get back to pre-pandemic levels and can improve from there. We were at, call it, in the mid-14% range pre-pandemic, and we're on our way back towards those. And our goal, certainly, would be more expansion after that. Heather Balsky : Okay, thank you for that color. Operator : Scott Schneeberger, Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. Good morning. And guys, I have one more following up on inflation and price. You had stated that the majority of the growth is coming from volume. And I'm just curious, I guess the essence of the question is what percent of the -- you're doing on a customer by customer base, but what percent of your base would you say you have affected with price increases at this juncture and will we see a greater percentage of the growth going forward coming from the pricing side as opposed to the volume side as that kicks in on who you've already priced and who you maybe have yet to a price, just a little bit better feel on the time as how much more contribution we may see from price offsetting cost pressure going forward? Thanks. Todd M. Schneider: Thanks for the question, Scott. How we approach it, as I mentioned, it's once a year, but it's a relatively smoothed out throughout the year. And as we've talked about in the past, some of it depends upon the condition of that customer, how their business is, that industry, that geography. And as time goes on, hopefully, that will become a lot more consistent. But no, I think what you're seeing, as far as our volume growth and the pricing wins that we're getting, I think you'll see that be pretty consistent in the future. I don't think you'll see an outsized percentage coming from pricing next year and the coming weeks, months, or something like that, because of how we approach it. And again, we're very, very happy with the level of demand that we're seeing from our customer base. It's very attractive for us. We're investing appropriately for it, and we're very pleased. Scott Schneeberger : Great, thanks. Appreciate that response. For my follow-up, I'm just curious, going back to this 1% of SAP extended membership in which you're participating. Could you elaborate on how that came to be and you covered some of the benefits about what it offers. But just if you could take us a little bit deeper on, was that something you pursued, was that something that they granted, how it came to be and just where you expect to go with that? Thanks. Todd M. Schneider: Great. Great. Yes. We're very proud of the relationship we have with SAP, and it goes back a number of years now. And it is something that they bestowed upon us. Our relationship has been flourishing over the past few years because of the degree to which we deploy their technology and the usefulness that we get out of it. So I think they really like seeing how we leverage their technology. And as a result, it gets us, as I mentioned, it's -- we're in a different stratosphere. And you think about SAP's customer base and then you think about that we're being in the top 1%, it's unique air. And so as I mentioned, it does get us relationships at very high levels. There's an SAP board member that is assigned to us as a customer. We have relationships, again, obviously, at really, really high levels. But it gets us access to their developers and to their technologies on the front end instead of it being rolled out. And then we got to figure out, we can have input and instead of just having something roll out and then we got to figure out how to manage through the change. So when you're in that 1%, you have the ear of those folks and allows you to impact where those items go. So as a result, we think that's an advantage for us. And we're very pleased with it and very pleased with our investment with SAP, and we're seeing real dividends from that as we -- I think we've laid out over the past few quarters. Scott Schneeberger : That sounds great. Thanks, I will turn it over. Operator : Shlomo Rosenbaum, Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey Todd, where are you now in terms of opening up and getting back to normal, like kind of an apples-to-apples basis in terms of volumes with your customers. So pre-COVID versus where you are today, how much more is -- juice is left in that kind of recovery play for things just kind of opening up more and getting back to your historical basis of, let's say, 2019 volume levels? Todd M. Schneider: Shlomo, great question. Our customers are, for the most part, they're all open. Certainly, there are some that are, unfortunately, that did not survive through the pandemic and the challenges that through at folks. But our customers are all -- I'll say they're open. They're not all at the same levels of consumption that they once were. Some are higher, some are lower. But we think there's still similar opportunity there as the economy opens up and to a larger degree, as people are back more to work to a larger degree. So we think that's positive. And we think there's also some hidden benefits that we can get from the fact that during the -- throughout the pandemic, as we've talked about, the customers see us in a different light. How we handled their accounts, how we handled their invoices, the lack of increase in the flexibility that we provided, but also the access to product that they didn't even know that we provided in the past. So Shlomo, that is an advantage for us. The fact that they look at it and they say, \"Wow, we didn't realize Cintas provided these items.\" They can get them. They're great to work with. They're consistent and they're reasonable. So as a result, that, I think, sets a different level of different pool level. But we still think there's even more opportunities within that customer base where folks -- where they will get back to a spend level where they once were. So we think the future looks quite attractive from that standpoint. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, thank you. And then just to clarify, maybe, this is for you, Mike. The equity method investment was the supply chain technology business, early stage that you brought in and then you decided that you wanted to own all of it, but it's not the product sale, it's a capability to manage your business internally, is that what we're talking about? J. Michael Hansen : It's a -- it has been an entity where we've done product innovation that has created products for the rental division, particularly in Facility Services. So it's -- while it isn't a direct producer of revenue, it has created products over the years that have created revenue streams for the rental division. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, alright. Thank you very much. Operator : Toni Kaplan, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. I wanted to ask one more follow-up on inflation and whether you have inflationary escalators built into the contracts and if you do, what percent of contracts do you have that built in? Todd M. Schneider: Toni, I appreciate the question. As I mentioned earlier, we have such a broad customer base that you name it, we have it from a contractual standpoint. Generally speaking, we have the ability to raise price and no limits, and do so as we deem appropriate. We fundamentally and practically, how we've handled it is we go in and we talk to the customer once a year and explain what the adjustment -- the price adjustment is and we managed through that. But no, we're not limited. Certainly, do we have certain customers that we have limits on? Absolutely. But generally speaking, no, we're not limited from that standpoint. It's more about making good long-term practical decisions that help us retain those customers for life. And while we're at it, I'll just -- I will say, our customer retention rates are really attractive right now. They have been since -- for the past couple of years and they have certainly not degraded. So we're excited about that. I think in large part, it's our approach, Toni, that we take on this subject about the flexibility, the pricing, the reasonableness and we have good conversations that I think people understand and we can manage through it. Toni Kaplan : Great. And there are a couple of -- there's a question about different verticals earlier and you mentioned a couple of them in specific, but I wanted to understand if there were certain verticals outside of, I think it was healthcare and hospitality that we mentioned earlier, that have seen higher or lower growth than normal, just if there's any others that would makes sense to call out? And then related, just wanted to hear any color on the new business pipeline. Thanks. Todd M. Schneider: Sure. So hospitality is obviously, as you're reading in the journal and other periodicals, it's -- bookings are way up for those folks there. So that's bounced back nicely. Healthcare has been some stops and starts, but the demand for our products have been very consistent. And through the pandemic, us being -- having product available was a big deal. And the movement towards getting away from, in many cases, as folks looking at and saying, \"hey, we don't want a onetime disposable.\u201d They're hard to access, not great for the environment and going to reusable has been great in health care, which we've kind of detailed out in the past. Education sector, has been, I'd say, a little bit of stops and starts as well in the fact that they literally stopped and started in their schools in many cases. But generally speaking, the education sector is doing quite well. And then lastly, with the government sector, that's obviously been really consistent. And we like our verticals. We like our approach in those areas and they're all growing attractively, and we expect them to continue to grow attractively based upon our strategy there. Toni Kaplan : Thank you. Todd M. Schneider: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Alright, it appears there are no further questions in the queue, I would like to hand the call back over to Mr. Paul Adler for any additional or closing remarks. Over to you, sir. Paul F. Adler: Alright. Thanks, Sergei, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We will issue our fourth quarter fiscal 2022 financial results in July. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President and Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Paul Adler : Thanks Darren. And thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our fiscal 2022 fourth quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'll now turn the call over to Todd. Todd Schneider : Thank you Paul. Our fourth quarter financial results are led by a strong revenue increase of 13.0% to $2.07 billion. Despite strong inflationary headwinds, operating income margin increased 10 basis points to 19.5% and EPS grew 13.8% to $2.81. Our sales force continues to add new customers and penetrate and cross-sell our existing base. Businesses prioritize, [all we] [ph] provide including image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance. Challenge was finding labor to run their business, heighten concerns over sanitization and the inflationary labor and purchasing costs, businesses increasingly outsourced to Cintas to help them get ready for the workday. We were able to deliver increased operating margin and EPS despite this period of significant inflation by productively selling new business, penetrating existing customers with more products and services, providing excellent service while driving operational efficiencies and obtaining incremental price increases from our customer base. Fourth quarter free cash flow increased 15.2% from last year. On June 15, we paid shareholders $98.2 million in quarterly dividends. And during the fourth quarter and through July 13, 2022, we purchased $496.5 million of Cintas common stock under our buyback program. We continue to allocate capital in many ways to improve shareholder returns. We are pleased with our fourth quarter financial results. They conclude a fiscal year of significant accomplishments, including the following : Fiscal year 2022 revenue was a record $7.85 billion, an increase of 10.4%. The organic revenue growth rate was 10.2%. Excluding two gains recorded this fiscal year and one recorded last fiscal year, operating income margin increased 50 basis points to 19.7%. We allocated capital to improve shareholder return. Acquisition spend was $164.2 million. In fiscal 2022 and up until today, we repurchased 4.3 million shares of Cintas stock for a total of $1.62 billion. Also, we increased the dividend 26.7%. We have increased the dividend every year since going public, which is 38 consecutive years. We made significant progress on our digital transformation journey. Our customers continue to find [added value] [ph] in managing their program through our online solution. We expect the ease of doing business with us to drive greater customer retention and faster revenue realization. We are actively using our new rolled out proprietary routing technology, which we call Smart Truck. This technology helps us make smarter routing decisions, enabling us to spend more time with our customers on service and sales, and also allows us to reduce energy usage and expense by driving fewer miles. We also made great strides in data analytics and enhanced business reporting, helping us target penetration, cross-selling, operational efficiencies, and pricing opportunities. In addition, as part of our steadfast commitment to corporate responsibility, we issued our second environmental social and governance or ESG report. It's a more robust report. Cintas was founded on a sustainable business model. Our corporate culture is based on doing what's right and challenging ourselves to improve. With this in mind, we announced our ambition to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. And finally, our actions are being recognized. We were again named to the prestigious Fortune 500. It's an honor to be recognized among the most successful and respected companies. We were also recently added to the FTSE4Good Index Series. The Index Series includes companies demonstrating strong ESG practices. I thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders, and each other. Cintas has grown revenue and adjusted EPS in 51 of the past 53 years. And our prospects for continued profitable growth are great. They result in part from a strong value proposition and a vast total addressable market. Every business, goods producing or services providing, has a need for image, safety, cleanliness, or compliance. Operating a business is increasingly complex. Rather than doing it themselves, businesses increasingly outsource to Cintas. We provide the products and perform the services better, faster, and economically [frame businesses] [ph] to concentrate on their core competency. Since every business has a need for image, safety, cleanliness, or compliance, our total addressable market is vast. The prospects for Uniform or workwear rental are significant. The unserved workwear rental market is tremendous. Tens of billions of dollars of workwear are sold by retailers each year to workers in every sector of the economy. There are millions of people in healthcare alone, hospitals, urgent care, doctors office, dentists offices, and long-term care going to work every day in shrubs purchased from retailers. We focus on targeting these retail customers converting them to a rental program. The fact that consistently 60% of our new customers are converted from retail to a rental program speaks to the size of the opportunity, as well as our continued success. Plus, we are more than just a Uniform Rental company. More than half of our revenue is from facility services including hygiene, floor care items such as dust mats and mops, cleaning tools like microfiber mops and towels, first aid cabinet services, and fire protection services including test and inspection of extinguishers and alarms. Every business that has a door, floor, wall, bathroom, and employees is a sales prospect. Our organic revenue growth rates are indicative of our compelling value proposition and tremendous market size. We grow revenue in multiples of GDP and jobs growth because of ample supply and demand for our products and services. Our growth in revenue is profitable growth and our operating margins have a long runway for expansion. Growth results in more buying power with our suppliers. It produces operating leverage. Route density increases reducing energy expenses and providing more time to spend with customers on service and sales. Growth means more volume in the plants, covering fixed cost of building, machinery and equipment. And when we penetrate existing customers with more products and services, the incremental operating margins are even stronger because we realize more revenue per service step. The future of Cintas remains bright. I'll now turn the call over to Mike to provide the details of our fourth quarter results and our financial expectations for fiscal 2023. Mike Hansen : Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2022 fourth quarter revenue of $2.07 billion compares to $1.84 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 12.7%. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was $1.63 billion, compared to $1.47 billion last year. Organic revenue growth was 10.5%. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the fourth quarter was $218.2 million, compared to $186.9 million last year. Organic revenue growth was 15.1%. This strong growth rate reflects the growing momentum of our First Aid Cabinet business, which grew 25% in the fourth quarter. While personal protective equipment remains elevated compared to pre-COVID levels, PPE revenue was about 7% less than the fourth quarter of last year. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $226.2 million, compared to $181.9 million last year. The fire business organic growth rate was 18.3% and the Uniform Direct Sale business organic growth rate was 53.5%, both businesses finished the year strong. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was $946.2 million, compared to $859.1 million last year, an increase of 10.1%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 45.6% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, compared to 46.8% last year. Gross margin percentage by business was 45.7% for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment, 46.1% for First Aid and Safety Services, 47.5% for Fire Safety Services, and 39.3% for Uniform Direct Sale. Operating income of $404.4 million, compared to $356.4 million last year, an increase of 13.5%. Operating income margin was 19.5%, compared to 19.4% reported last year, a 10 basis point increase. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.8%, compared to 19.4% last year. The tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income for the fourth quarter was $294.5 million, compared to $267.7 million last year. Diluted EPS was $2.81, compared to $2.47 last year, an increase of 13.8%. Note that the higher effective tax rate in this year's fourth quarter was a 500 basis point headwind to the EPS growth rate and a $0.12 headwind to EPS. For our fiscal year 2023, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $8.47 billion to $8.58 billion, an increase of 7.8% to 9.2% over fiscal 2022. We expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $11.90 to $12.30. Please note the following : Fiscal 2022 included a gain on sale of operating assets in the first quarter and a gain on an equity investment in the third quarter. Excluding these items fiscal 2022 operating income was $1.55 billion, a margin of 19.7%, and diluted EPS was $11.28. Please see the table in our earnings press release for more information. Fiscal 2023 operating income is expected to be in the range of $1.68 billion to $1.73 billion, compared to $1.55 billion in fiscal 2022 after excluding the gains. Fiscal 2023 interest expense is expected to be approximately $110 million, compared to $88.8 million in fiscal 2022 due in part to higher interest rates. Our fiscal 2023 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%. This compares to a rate of 17.9% in fiscal 2022 after excluding the gains and their related tax impacts. The expected higher effective tax rate will negatively impact fiscal 2023 diluted EPS by approximately $0.32 per share and diluted EPS growth by approximately 290 basis points.  Our financial guidance includes share buybacks through July 13, 2022, but does not include the impact of any future share buybacks. And we remain in a dynamic environment that can continue to change. Our guidance contemplates a stable economy and excludes pandemic related setbacks or economic downturns. I'll turn it back over to Paul. Paul Adler : That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Darren, I'll turn it over to you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Faiza Alwy : Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. I guess my first question is just around, you mentioned that your guidance contemplates a stable economic environment and does not contemplate any economic downturn. Could you maybe talk to us more about that? I know that historically you've outperformed the economy, but to the extent as you know there are a lot of concerns around the potential recession in the United States and globally, could you maybe talk a little bit about how your outlook may change to the extent that we run into an economic downturn? Todd Schneider : Certainly, Faiza. Thank you for the question and good morning. When we think about our guidance for next year, for fiscal 2023, we like our momentum. We like where we are through this point in our fiscal year. We like our sales productivity. We like our leverage that we think we're getting. And we are not trying to predict the next recession and certainly not the depth or breadth of that recession. In many ways I hope that my customers don't read the newspaper or look at \u2013 I ever listened to the news because, yes, what you hear, they're certainly scattered approaches out there, but what I can tell you is, we like what we're seeing in our business. We like the momentum that we're seeing in our business. And if a recession occurs, a downturn occurs, then we will manage it appropriately, which we have always done and we'll continue to do so. And we're quite confident in our ability to do so and we remain poised and we're watching it very closely. Faiza Alwy : Excellent. Just as a follow-up, could you talk about energy costs? As you know, there's been quite a bit of volatility as it relates to oil prices. You've historically disclosed, sort of how much energy impacted your margins. Maybe could you just talk to us about what the impact was this quarter and what you're anticipating for 2023? Mike Hansen : Sure, Faiza. Our fourth quarter energy for the total company was 2.5%, that's up 40 basis points from a year ago. In our rental segment, energy was up 50 basis points. So, just a little bit more in that business. Our expectation is, on the whole, fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, we're going to see an increase of call it 20 basis points to 30 basis points. We certainly have seen the energy high in June in the first part of our quarter here, but it's nice to see that the price of the pumps come down just a little bit in the last couple of weeks. And our expectation is that it's not going to stay at this elevated level, but certainly higher than our fiscal 2022 year. Faiza Alwy : Understood. Thank you so much. Mike Hansen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Hamzah Mazari : Hi, good morning. My first question is just around labor challenges, labor availability, could you give us a sense of how much demand could you not meet because labor was an issue? And is that fair? Was there demand out there that you couldn't meet because of labor challenges? And if so, what would the growth have been if labor wasn't an issue? And do you see labor normalizing at some point? Do you have some ability into that? Any thoughts there? Todd Schneider : Hamzah, it is \u2013 thank you for your question, it is certainly a challenging environment on the labor side. But I'm quite happy where we are staffed and our team has done an incredible job in managing through that process. The demand for our customers as you can see is quite robust and we're meeting that demand. And so it wouldn't be popular here if someone said that, hey, I can't meet the demand, so my revenues aren't going to be as good. That's not how we run our business. And we're proud of the fact that we're staffed well. We've got a really great team that is meeting the customers' needs and exceeding them. And as far as labor in the future, that's a tough one, but you would think that it might be easing a bit, but we're really not seeing it. It\u2019s trying to attract and retain and develop really good people is challenging today as I can ever remember in my career, but when things are really hard like that, we think it gives us a chance to shine. And I think we're doing just exactly that. Hamzah Mazari : Got it. And just my follow-up question is just around M&A. Clearly, balance sheet is under levered. Clearly, you bought a lot of stock back and continue to \u2013 are valuations just too high or were you looking for a larger deal that, sort of didn't pan out, just sort of any thoughts there? I know one of your competitors is spinning off their business and I know you don't comment specifically on M&A, but maybe just thoughts on M&A environment, what you're seeing there? Have valuations come in with the market coming in, and with some of the labor challenges, maybe private operators are more in distress than your business? Todd Schneider : Great question. We don't comment specifically on M&A, but what I can tell you is this that we are actively pursuing deals of all shapes and sizes. And certainly, valuations matter certainly. But it really takes two to dance. And we got to find \u2013 the right situation has to occur for [indiscernible] of an organization \u2013 shareholders of an organization to be willing sellers. And that tends to pace it more than anything. As you mentioned correctly, our balance sheet, we love our position and we're ready, willing and able to make deals of all shapes and sizes. Hamzah Mazari : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line open. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Can you provide an update on how customer purchasing behaviors have changed in the current environment? How have ad stops in cross-selling evolved among your customer base? Todd Schneider : George, the current customer penetration, the current customer buying patterns have been good. As you can see in our revenue, over the course of the year, our revenue has accelerated each quarter and that's due in part because of really good new business, but our existing customers and the penetration we're seeing at those customers has gone very well and that certainly has been a part of the contribution of the accelerating growth. Todd mentioned, we love our momentum as you can certainly see through the quarterly growth throughout this year and a pretty good guide. And we just \u2013 we haven't seen a change in their behavior. Our value propositions that Todd talked about in our script and the outsourcing needs and the difficulties that are facing businesses because of the labor challenges that they're facing, it has resonated. Our value has resonated really well with those customers. And so the outsourcing has been good. So, all-in-all, George, we like the momentum and the performance of those existing customers has been really good. George Tong : Very helpful. Thank you. And then with respect to pricing trends, can you talk a little bit about how that's also changed in the current environment? And if your latest pricing increases are fully offsetting input cost inflation or more than offsetting input cost inflation? Mike Hansen : George, great question. As I mentioned earlier, it's a very challenging environment. We've said all along that we're not immune from inflation, but we really like our plan and our investments. And clearly, pricing is a component of our strategy. It has to be \u2013 input costs are significant because specifically labor and material costs, but we think we're doing a great job with that. Our price adjustments are certainly above historical as they need to be to address the costs that are coming through organization. We've done a really nice job of leveraging SG&A to provide us room to invest in other areas where we've had to add people and certainly labor rates etcetera, but it's working nicely. And part of our focus, a big part of our focus is we are looking at customers from a long-term standpoint and saying, yes, we have to adjust price and it will be above historical. However, we are going to find a way to grow margins and do so in ways other than just pricing. And we're doing that in certainly many key initiatives to help improve and find efficiencies in our business. So, you didn't ask specifically about that, but I think that's what you're getting at. And I'll just provide a little bit more color on that because I think it might be helpful for folks to understand that as we take this long term approach with customers, we'll adjust price, but we're going to go find efficiencies so that we can still improve our business and improve margins. I mentioned in our script and by the way most of this, of our efficiencies are tied to SAP and our digital transformation. SAP is the backbone of how we run our business and how we find \u2013 how we're able to enjoy the digital transformation that we're experiencing and our customers are experiencing as well. So just bear with me. I'll walk through a few of these for some color. I mentioned [in] [ph] My Cintas online portal, which \u2013 it provides us really nice leverage. It provides us improved revenue via sales and retention because customers value the ability to manage their program and pay their bills on their time, not just when our office is available. So that's great, but it also provides us some improved productivity because it allows customers to self-serve instead of our partners having to take care of that as well. I mentioned in the script as well, our Smart Truck technology, which is proprietary routing technology, it allows for more efficient routing and tracking of our vehicles. Where does this help us? It helps us and provides us more time that we can spend with customers instead of driving. That's more productivity. It provides real time tracking to assist with customer needs. It helps us reduce idle times, which is obviously important to us. Lower fuel consumption and obviously lower GHG emissions as a result. And in fact, over the last three quarters within our rental division, our distance between customers has reduced 5%, which is just \u2013 it's just finding an efficiency in our business by leveraging technology and because driving, as we've always said, when the wheels are moving, we don't generate any revenue, it\u2019s when we\u2019ll stop.  So that's important to us. And then, we also have something that we've rolled out through our technology transformation or digital transformation. What we call our operational excellence dashboards, which allows for us the ability to evaluate our production facilities, our plans to see how they're performing without having to be at each plant physically to evaluate performance. So, in the past, you had to be at a plant to see how they were performing and were they on time and were turn times in our washout. We track everything. And now we have technology that allows us to do that. And so it's all driven because of our SAP platform. Many of this, it ends up showing up in faster turnaround of product, better utilization of in service inventory, which helps offset purchases. It's been significant for us. And I thought I'd just provide a little color because I thought it might help you as you think about pricing and how we're fighting inflation. George Tong : That's very helpful color. Thank you very much. Mike Hansen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Ashish Sabadra from RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to focus on the healthcare, government and education vertical, those three key verticals that were a key area of focus. How's the progress on that front? And then maybe a more broader question is around the economic sensitivity of your end market. Just wanted to follow-up on the earlier question like how much of the revenues really generated from more sensitive end market versus more recession resilient end markets? Any color on that front will be helpful. Thanks. Todd Schneider : Ashish, thanks for the question. Our verticals are quite robust. We've invested significantly there. And we look at those as businesses. How we operate the products, the services that we're providing the tools to our partners, and that provides us advantages in the marketplace and helps us \u2013 positions us to provide better services to our customers, which is important to us. And certainly, the education sectors had \u2013 the last two years have been a bit bumpy for them. It seems like they're meaning with closures and what have you that appears to be behind them hopefully. The government sector has been very consistent for us. Hospitality, as you read, has been quite robust and continues the demand and the hospitality sector seems to be quite good. And when we think about our Fortune 1000 and corporate accounts sectors, our customers seem to be doing quite well and trying to see into the future and see what will occur. Is the recession imminent? Are we in one? Is it going to be next year? Here I can tell you is, our value proposition, what Mike spoke about of \u2013 the items that we provide are important to people, provides compliance and sanitization, image, health, wellness, those things are very important. And then, when you combine that with the fact that it's \u2013 there's still over 11 million job openings in the country. And as a result, it's tough for our customers to hire and train and keep their people and they're looking to us to outsource items. And we're in a great position to take that on and we're happy to take that on and help them with those functions. Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful color. And maybe just a quick one on the follow-up on the healthcare. I know the last disclosure was I think almost 7% of the revenue with the opportunity to be 10% of the revenue in the mid-term. I was wondering if it's possible to provide any update on that front, particularly on the healthcare side? Todd Schneider : Yes. The healthcare has been an absolute great vertical for us. It's a very important one. It's our largest vertical, as we look at the opportunities still \u2013 it\u2019s still under 10%. We see an amazing runway there. And big items in the future when you think over the coming years, because again, we're organized appropriately to meet the needs of those customers. We know them really well and we listen to what their needs are. And we're addressing them and continuing to invest in technology that will help them to be more successful to help them run a better business and we're quite bullish on that vertical. Ashish Sabadra : That's great. Congrats on the strong momentum in the business. Todd Schneider : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Andy Wittmann from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andy Wittmann : Hi, great. Thanks. I was just wondering if, as you look back at the fact that you grew margins during COVID, so recently just a couple of years ago, does that limit any flexibility that you have on your margins or excuse me, on your P&L, if we were to head into the next recession? Mike Hansen : Andy, thanks for the question. It depends upon the when, how long, how deep that recession is and that's for others to try to forecast. But we see \u2013 fortunately, we have plenty of runway on finding efficiencies in our business. When we think about the value that we're providing our customers, you know when our customers are healthy, our business is that much better, but we will fight through whatever recession comes our way. We've done that and we've shown the ability to gross sales and profits in, I'd say, just about every operating environment out there. 51 of the past 53 years, the exception being the 2008, 2009. I certainly hope that it's not that deep, [nasty] [ph] for recession, whatever comes next, but we'll be prepared to manage through that as you've seen us do over the years. Todd Schneider : Andy, I might just add, you know we certainly adjusted at the beginning of the pandemic our cost structure and we're able to pull costs out, but as you can imagine for the last, I'll call it, five quarters, our revenue growth has been really solid and accelerating, and so along the way, there have been investments that have been necessary and investments that we've wanted to make, and that means we've added growth routes back that we took out in the early days of the pandemic. We've added capacity in our production facilities to handle this great volume growth that we've had. And so, we've got this investment going on right now. And as Todd said, look, if the environment changes and we need to pivot you've seen us pivot pretty effectively certainly in the last few years and we'll do that again if the economic situation requires us to do so. Andy Wittmann : That's helpful color. Mike, I just, I don't usually ask about the all other segment, but there was a big number on the direct sale. I think you said plus 53% year-over-year. Obviously, comps were relatively easy, but was that just a program that was contained in the quarter or do you \u2013 is there something changed in the outlook that could either flow into 1Q or more sustainably change in how that business is going to market or how customers are reacting? Mike Hansen : Great. Thank you, Andy. And the partners in that area, thank you for asking about it as well. As you know, that can be a little bit more spiky, the direct sale business, but the comps were easier, but nevertheless, we like the momentum we have in that business. We've diversified our customer base. We're selling to a broader area. We've got nice position in that market. And yes, we like where we are. Now, certainly comps will get tougher next year. So, even more so in the back half of the year, not just for that business, but all of our businesses. But we really like the momentum and the position in the marketplace in that business. Andy Wittmann : Great. Thanks guys. Mike Hansen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning. Todd, thank you earlier for all those kind of productive examples we talked about. And despite the high inflation environment, you guys have one of the few companies that are showing margin expansion. And so, I was hoping that maybe you or Mike could remind us of the big cost buckets and how you are being able to manage through [differentiation the environment] [ph] to show this margin expansion and how perhaps sustainable it could be? Mike Hansen : Sure Manav, certainly when you think about the cost structure and I'll speak mostly to our rental business. Certainly, labor is an important bucket for us. And as you've heard Todd explain over the last four quarters or so, we've worked really hard over the last several years to improve the \u2013 or increase the rates at higher than I'll say historical averages and that left us not flat footed in this challenging environment and it's allowed us to continue to raise, but not in an alarming rate that maybe some of our other competitors have had to do. And we'll continue to manage that very, very appropriately. The other bucket that I'll mention is, our material costs. Certainly material cost is a big component. And as you know, we are able to amortize the rental items. So, the items that we are reusing in the business in a recurring nature garments, dust mats, mops, etcetera, shop towels. And so, we're able to amortize those and so we don't get inflation impact immediately. This amortization allows us to understand what's coming and it allows us to anticipate and that allows our global supply chain to flex when we need to, to change volumes around. And that's very important for us to be able to see ahead, and the other thing it allows us to do, it allows us to potentially get a couple of price increases in, before that, I'll say higher cost even hits our P&L. So for example, when we have \u2013 if we have cost increases in our materials, and we amortize those over 18 months. That first high \u2013 that first months of higher cost, we have [one-eighteenth] [ph] of it. The second month, we get [two-eighteenth] [ph] of it. So, it doesn't fully hit our P&L for eighteen months. We can adapt, make decisions, including pricing decisions before that fully hits us. So, we have this, we've got this nice, I'll call it, hedge in that part of the cost structure and that certainly is an important part of our cost structure. And the other thing I'll say is, certainly we've got some infrastructure and we can leverage that infrastructure pretty well with revenue growth like we've got it today and the momentum. And so, we've been able to manage all of those buckets in different ways, but quite appropriately. And then when you couple of those \u2013 the way we manage those different buckets with the initiatives that Todd spoke of to get efficiencies, labor efficiencies, productivity improvements, technology improvements, those things can really help us as we face inflation and as Todd laid out, we've got a pretty good game plan against it. As you've seen, we've in this year just ended, in a pretty difficult inflationary environment, we were able to raise our operating margins 50 basis points. Manav Patnaik : Thank you, Mike. Yes, I think that's very helpful. We get a lot of this question. Just as a follow-up, the 164 million that you spent on the deals, can you just give us a flavor of, kind of where, how many, the size of those deals and perhaps what that small tuck-in pipeline looks like? Todd Schneider : Sure. We're always working that pipeline and we've made some very nice deals in our rental segment this year. We also certainly made some very nice deals in our first-aid and fire businesses as well. And then we had the equity investment that we effectively bought out and that is more of a global supply chain impacting acquisition. But we like all of them and they have certainly provided some nice synergies in a tuck-in nature for the year. And we'll continue to work on those as we move forward. We think the pipeline is good. Manav Patnaik : All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Andrew Steinerman from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andrew Steinerman : Hi. Two questions. The first one is, in the 2023 revenue guide that you gave percentages in dollars, could you just also give that in terms of the percentages in organic constant currency numbers as well? Because I assume FX makes difference and M&A might have [a some needle moving] [ph]. And the second question, I just want to hear more about your First Aid business, like particularly the Cabinets business? Like what percentage of First Aid is in Cabinets now versus pre-COVID? How fast is your Cabinets business growing and then you also introduced a new product COVID testing and \u2013 COVID test kits, and how is that going? Mike Hansen : Sure. Andrew, I'll tackle the first part and turn the First Aid question over to Todd. So, as it relates to our revenue guidance, 7.8% on the low-end, 9.2% on the high-end. In the fourth quarter, we had 30 basis points of organic benefit and FX impact. I would expect that we'll see that continue for let's call it the first half of the year. And depending on then the acquisitions that we make in fiscal 2023, we may see that continue, but any future acquisitions are not baked into those numbers. So, call it the first half of the year we\u2019ll continue with something in the way of 20 basis points to 30 basis points of M&A and FX. And that's probably going to decrease then without any new M&A activity in the back half of the year. Does that answer your question Andrew? Andrew Steinerman : Yes. Mike Hansen : Okay. And then Todd, I'll turn it over to you for the first aid. Todd Schneider : Great. Thanks for the question, Andrew. Yes, our \u2013 certainly as a percent \u2013 our first aid cabinets dropped during the COVID, but it's coming back and coming back quite nicely. In fact, it grew 25%, our first aid cabinet business did in Q4 and that's very, very encouraging. And it's showing up in our margins as well. So, we will continue to be opportunistic in helping customers with the breadth of our offering. Certainly don't know exactly what COVID will bring this fall, but we're focused on growing our first aid business in helping all of our customers in that area. If that means they need COVID test kits, we'll help them if they need masks, we\u2019ll help them. You name it. But our focus is on trying to make sure that we're growing that profitable consistent first aid cabinet business and we're very encouraged by the trends. Andrew Steinerman : Okay. Thank you very much. Todd Schneider : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Seth Weber : Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe for Mike, can you just talk about \u2013 I mean, the free cash flow is really strong here. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about CapEx going forward? And just talk maybe, give us a sense for kind of where you're at from a capacity utilization perspective and whether you have enough capacity or CapEx needs to go higher from here? Thanks. Mike Hansen : Sure. Yes, Seth. Our free cash flow has been good. Our expectation is that that's not going to change in this upcoming fiscal 2023 year. Our CapEx look, we expect it to be in the 3% to 3.5% of revenue type of a range. If you look over the last 10 years, that's maybe a little bit down from where we've been, but we're going to keep investing in the business. As it relates to our capacity, we have had some really good growth this year. And there are spots where we've had to add capacity, but generally speaking, I don't expect that we'll have significant and I'll say lumped together type of capacity investments that will happen over time as we continue to grow. So, our expectation is our good and healthy free cash flow will continue in fiscal 2023. Todd Schneider : Seth, as I spoke about it earlier, one of the items that we're focused on is, making sure that we leverage our infrastructure to its fullest whether that be our fleet, but also our production facilities. And as I mentioned, our operating excellence technology platform is helping us to make sure we're finding all the efficiencies in our business and in certain cases that's allowing us to forgo CapEx as a result because we're able to find efficiencies in running our business and our production facilities as well. And we'll continue to do that as the very best we can. Seth Weber : Okay, thanks. And then maybe just on the fire business, can you just give us a little bit of color what's driving the strength there, double-digit revenue strength seems \u2013 it's been double-digits for a while now and is that just you're taking share from smaller operators? Is that where some of the inorganic growth is coming from? Just any color on how that business is being sustained at this kind of double-digit level? Todd Schneider : Sure, Seth. We really like the fire business. We have a very good team that's operating and selling into our customer base. The uniqueness about the fire customers is there really is no program market, right. Everybody is served, they're served in some manner, but we've invested in that business to make sure that we are positioned with the best people, the best technology that we are continuing to invest in there and the best training and one that really \u2013 we like our spot there from \u2013 the levels of service that we're providing our customers and it's getting noticed. And that's a business that you want to feel good about who's walking in your facility and who's taking care of you. And we think that we're well-positioned. So, good momentum in that business and we're focused on continuing that momentum. Seth Weber : Okay, guys. Thanks very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Heather Balsky : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I want to piggyback on some of the questions regarding just business risk in a tougher macro environment if we do see one. Can you just talk at a high level how your business has changed say over the last decade since last economic recession through non-COVID? In terms of cyclicality, do you think from an end customer perspective in the verticals you operate or from a product perspective where you think you're better positioned today than you may have been a decade ago? Thanks. Mike Hansen : Sure, Heather. I'll say a couple of things. We've got first of all great momentum in the business and we love the value that we're providing our customers and the outsourcing that is needed in this challenging time is really resonating and working well for us. So that's really important for us in any turn in the economy we like our momentum. That's important. I would say, if you think about the last 10 years, our growth has been in multiples above GDP and why is that? And multiples above employment growth. And why is that? It's because we're able to sell number one to many what we call in the industry no programmers. So those that don't have a current recurring program. And that's important because in any kind of environment, we go to prospects and existing customers and when we sell the value, usually it's for things that they're already spending money on. And so we're not necessarily asking them to spend new money, we're asking them to spend money with us while we take work content away from them. So, for example, we don't want you to do things, we don't want our customers to do it all themselves. That takes time, capacity, labor, etcetera. We want to help them do it. And so as we take that work content away from them, again in any type of environment that's helpful, but certainly in one where businesses are feeling the pressure of an economy that can really resonate and help. So, we like the way that our value is working. And in the past, we've really been able to grow when there hasn't been much economic growth or employment growth. And our expectation is, we'll continue to be able to do that. 60% of our new business comes from those no programmers. The other thing is, look, we've got a different kind of sales force today than we did at 10, 12 years ago and that sales force is really dialed in on finding those no programmers, finding the business and also penetrating more and our penetration has worked very well. But that sales team is also focused on different verticals that we were walking by in the last recession. And those verticals like healthcare can be a little bit less impacted by recessions and that's good for us. So, we like the diversity in our customer base that we've created over the course of the last 10 years. We think moving forward that diversity is going to help us as we move forward. In addition to that, look, we're going to continue to look for M&A opportunities and we're going to look for \u2013 continue to look for efficiency opportunities and those will help protect us in the next downturn. We can't predict when it may happen. If it's happening, we can't predict how long, how deep, how broad it's going to be. but we like where we are today with momentum and a value proposition that is resonating better than ever. And as you've seen Heather over the course of the last few years, if we need to pivot, we've shown that we can pivot and pivot appropriately to match the environment. Heather Balsky : Thank you, appreciate that. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Toni Kaplan : Thanks so much. Mike, sorry if I missed this, but in the fourth quarter, you usually give the mix between rental sub segments, the shop towels, hygiene, etcetera. Can you give us an updated breakdown there? Paul Adler : Hey, Tony, it's Paul. I do have that information and this is just that Uniform Rental and Facility Services segments measured on Q4's activity. Uniform Rental, which is the workwear that we [rent, car hard] [ph], the healthcare scrubs are in there, that was 48% of the mix. Dust, which is the mats, the mops, similar cleaning tools 18%, hygiene at 17%, shop towels 4%, linens, which are typically apron's, towels, things that don't run through a flat iron machine that's 9% of the mix and then catalog revenue was about 4%. And those percentages are very similar to last year, which I think speaks to the continued strong demand that we have for all the products and services within that segment. Toni Kaplan : Terrific. And just sort of on this in similar lines, if you think about upselling within Uniform Rental, what are the real, sort of new products that people are demanding? What are \u2013 obviously in terms of cross-sell, we've seen a lot of success from the sanitizers and the COVID test kits and things like that, but when you look really specifically within rental what are, sort of the new upselling opportunities that you're seeing the most success in? Todd Schneider : Toni, within rental, we're seeing quite strong demand for all of our products and services and we really don't care where it starts as far as what we sell into a customer first because we have such a broad offering that we'll \u2013 whatever they're interested in, we'll help provide and then we'll continue to provide additional offerings to them. And \u2013 but when you think about it, right, it's a tough environment to hire and retain people, providing a benefit of workwear and laundering of workwear, that's a nice benefit for people and helps to attract and retain people. When you think about \u2013 if you're interested in our [restroom items] [ph], when it's hard to \u2013 when you're busy and you're trying to run a business, trying to deal with those items is something you'd rather \u2013 you'd love to outsource. And as I mentioned earlier, we're able to do it better, faster, cheaper, all that than what they can do for themselves. And in many of those cases, we're not even asking for additional spend. It's just a reallocated spend to us. So, whether that's \u2013 we have such a broad customer base. It depends, but I'm speaking more generically of you've got [restaurants] [ph], you've got people, you need products and services to help prepare your facility for either your customers, your guests, your employees, patients maybe. And so all of that is in very nice demand. And certainly, the focus on health, wellness, cleanliness, safety is more so today than it was a few years ago, which we think is that is positive for our business. Toni Kaplan : Terrific. Thanks. Todd Schneider : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Great. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Hey, Todd, I'm going to start with a question for you. Given the breadth of your business with like a million clients, you have kind of unique insight into [Main Street Americas] [ph], what is the sentiment amongst your clients and in terms of they're running their businesses and what you're thinking? What are you hearing from the salespeople? Are they leading back to the same kind of fear that we're seeing in the headlines of the newspapers and what the stock market seems to be indicating or is it really not that way? Is there kind of a disparity between the headlines and what you're actually seeing on the street from your view? Todd Schneider : Shlomo, great question. You're right. We have such a broad and diverse customer base. We're up and down Main Street, U.S.A. every single day. And we're watching it really closely. And it seems as though demand is quite strong. Their demand within their business, demand for our products and services. As I mentioned earlier, I hope \u2013 I think we'd all be better off if nobody read the news or listened to the news because it seems like we're trying to talk ourselves into it, but that being said, we're watching it really, really closely because as Mike mentioned, we'll pivot. We'll pivot appropriately. But to date, it appears as though Main Street, U.S.A. is doing just fine and we're encouraged by that. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Great. Thank you. And then, hey, Mike, maybe you could just talk a little bit about the dispersion of costs across the business units. The margin expansion was really pronounced in the First Aid and Safety and Other and then kind of the Rental Uniforms saw the margin come down, do they have just much more significant energy and labor aspect to it or maybe you can kind of explain that to us? Mike Hansen : Sure. Certainly, the rental business is more affected by energy than the other businesses, no question about it. We had really nice quarters in our First Aid business as you point out. And what you're seeing there is that cabinet growth that we talked about earlier in the call being 25% plus and that getting back to mix that we love. And so, we've \u2013 our First Aid team has really done a nice job of getting that \u2013 working on that mix and getting it back to the, I'll say, pre-pandemic type of mix closer to that kind of mix. So, really good mix shift and momentum in that business. Our fire and Uniform Direct Sale businesses margins are certainly benefiting from the great top line improvement. We're getting great leverage. They're not \u2013 that all other is not affected by the energy in the same way that rental is. And we're able to see some superb productivity out of that group too. So, we really like that momentum. On the rental side, we like where the business is and we've been investing in that business for the growth that we've seen in terms of an acceleration throughout the year. And look, operating a business isn't always a linear \u2013 perfect linear function. And that means there are times when there's a little bit more investment in some quarters, not as much in others. And look, overall, we love the trajectory of the rental business. We have certainly added some of those growth routes that I mentioned earlier, some capacity in the production facilities, but we like where the momentum is going in all of those businesses, but it's not a perfectly linear type of a thing to operate a business. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Sure. Just to clarify, in the focus in that the rental side, I guess the obvious answer would be, oh, you're seeing inflationary costs and that's what's kind of hitting that number, but I want to just kind of third out what you're saying over here that is there a heavier [weighting] [ph] of investment in the last quarter or some of the things exactly what you're saying. It may not be linear and it's not really the inflation that might be hitting you guys, but the fact that you're deciding to [continue it] [ph] invested this period? Todd Schneider : Well, I mean, look, the way that we typically invest is over time and as we need it and it's generally incremental. And in this particular case in the rental business, we've been investing all year. And sometimes, we're running up against a pretty high comp in last year's fourth quarter. And look, it's \u2013 I wouldn't say it's an overinvestment or that we underinvested in the past, it's just simply that we are investing in the way that we appropriately need to and some of that is a little bit more labor over the course of this year where we're lapping a year fiscal 2021 that was, you know it's significantly impacted by the pandemic. And as we've gotten into fiscal 2022, as we've accelerated our growth, we need capacity in order to grow. I think Hamzah may have asked a question earlier about are we able to find the labor that we need in order to continue to grow? And Todd answered, yes. And that investment is necessary, but it's important for us, especially in the long-term view that we have and that Todd talked about earlier. Operator : Thank you. We will now take a question from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. Looks like we're getting near the end here. So, I just have one, but there's a few parts to it, mostly modeling. So Mike, probably for you. Kind of a summary question, on operating margin, the guidance implies after a very good year of expansion in 2022, more expansion at the midpoint in 2023. What are the one or two things that you really worry about that could push you to the low end of the range? And then what are the couple items that could push you above? And then the latter part of this question is, cadence of operating margin into fiscal 2023, how comfortable are you and where are you thinking about for the first half of the year? And then kind of you talked about higher interest expense, what do you think the cadence is of that and maybe some color on the tax rate? Thanks for [indiscernible] all that at once. Mike Hansen : Sure. I'll do my best. Yes, the guide that we provided provides for operating income growth of 8.6% at the low, 12% at the high, when we're comparing to that adjusted [2022] [ph] operating income. What can take us to the low \u2013 I don't, I don't \u2013 we don't mean to be overconfident, but I would say that the things that concern us most are certainly the macro and what happens that's outside of our control. Right now, we really like the way the prospects and the customers view our value. Our sales productivity numbers are really high. And I think it's more about the macro for us. And certainly, we're not trying to time or predict a recession and our numbers don't necessarily incorporate a recession, but there's a little bit of economic movement that certainly can happen that may move us towards the low end of that range. If we don't see any economic slowdown, we certainly, given the revenue momentum, we certainly could exceed the high-end. So, I would say, more than anything, it's about the macro and how does that impact us. From an interest perspective, look, the Fed is not finished and we do have some, albeit a fairly small amount, but we do have some variable interest, variable debt and the Fed is not finished. So, we may see a little bit of an impact as we go through the year, but on the other hand, we generate a lot of cash. I talked about our free cash flow a little bit earlier and if we feel like we have available cash, we'll certainly pay down some variable debt. So, I would say the 110 that we gave in the guide is a reasonable number and I wouldn't expect that to move too much unless we did something with the use of our cash potentially in M&A, otherwise, I think that 110 is a fairly solid type of a number. From a tax rate perspective, look, it's hard to predict what's going to happen in the stock market. It's hard to predict based on the stock market movement how much we may see in the way of exercises of our stock options, etcetera, those things can have an impact on our tax rate. And so it's hard to predict where we're going to be, but that 20% that we're in the guide, I think that's a reasonable place for us and what would take to move that down, it would take a more significant amount of stock options being exercised than we're expecting or it certainly could be other discrete events that happen that we're not expecting, but I think the 20% is a fairly good guide again based on what we're seeing today. Scott Schneeberger : Great, great job answering that. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. We have no further time. So, I'll hand the call back to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Todd Schneider : Well, thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our first quarter of fiscal 2023 financial results in September. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President and Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Pardon me, interruption, Mr. Adler, we're unable to hear you. Paul Adler : Thank you. Yes, we were still on mute. So, thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our fiscal 2023 first quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'll now turn the call over to Todd. Todd Schneider : Thank you, Paul. We are pleased with our start to our fiscal year 2023. First quarter total revenue grew 14.2%. Each of our businesses increased revenue at a double-digit rate. The benefits of our strong revenue growth flow through to our bottom line. Excluding a one-time gain recorded in last year's first quarter selling and administrative expenses, operating income margin increased 20 basis points and EPS grew 12.3%. Our sales force continues to add new customers and penetrate and cross-sell our existing customer base. Businesses prioritize all we provide, including image, safety, cleanliness and compliance. In challenge with labor scarcity and rising costs, businesses continue to turn to Cintas to help them get ready for the workday. I thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders and each other. Turning now to our business units. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the first quarter of fiscal \u201823 was $1.70 billion compared to $1.51 billion last year. Organic revenue growth was 12.3%. Revenue growth was driven mostly from increased volume. Additionally, price increases contributed at a higher level than historically. We believe such a mix of revenue drivers volume versus price is healthy and supportive of continued long-term growth. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the first quarter was $234.2 million compared to $199.1 million last year. Organic revenue growth was 15.8%. This rate reflects the continued momentum of our First Aid cabinet business, which continues to grow more than 20%. Personal protective equipment or PPE, while still elevated compared to pre-COVID levels declined again on a sequential basis. We welcome this mix shift because the cabinet service is a more consistent revenue stream and has higher profit margins in PPE. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $234.5 million compared to $189.7 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue growth rate was 17.4% and the Uniform Direct Sale business organic growth rate was 44.1%. Before turning the call over to Mike to provide additional details on our first quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $8.47 billion to $8.58 billion to a range of $8.58 billion to $8.67 billion. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $11.90 to $12.30 to a range of $12.30 to $12.65. Mike? Mike Hansen : Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2023 first quarter revenue was $2.17 billion compared to $1.9 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 13.9%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal \u201823 was $1.03 billion compared to $902.8 million last year, an increase of 13.9%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 47.5% for the first quarter of fiscal \u201823 compared to 47.6% last year. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas and electricity were a headwind increasing 30 basis points from last year. Gross margin percentage by business was 47.5% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 49.6% for First Aid and Safety Services, 48.8% for Fire Protection Services, and 37.3% for Uniform Direct Sale. Operating income of $440.1 million compared to $394.1 million last year. Excluding last year's first quarter gain totaling $12.1 million and recorded in selling and administrative expenses, fiscal '23 first quarter operating income increased 15.2% and operating income margin increased 20 basis points to 20.3% from 20.1% last year. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 14.8% compared to 11% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income for the first quarter was $351.7 million compared to $331.2 million last year. Last year's first quarter diluted EPS contained $0.09 from the previously mentioned gain and related income tax expense. Excluding the gain and the related income tax expense, this year's diluted EPS of $3.39 compared to $3.02 last year, an increase of 12.3%. First quarter operating cash flow increased 13.8%. On June 15, 2022, we paid shareholders $97.7 million in quarterly dividends. Also during the quarter, we purchased $210.8 million of Cintas common stock under our buyback program. We continue to allocate capital in many ways to improve shareholder return. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow enable us to do so consistently. Todd provided our annual financial guidance. Related to the guidance, please note the following. Fiscal '22 included not only the gain on sale of operating assets in the first quarter, but also a gain on an equity method investment in the third quarter. Excluding these items, fiscal '22 operating income was $1.55 billion, a margin of 19.7% and diluted EPS was $11.28. Please see the table in our earnings press release for more information. Fiscal '23 operating income is expected to be in the range of $1.72 billion to $1.76 billion compared to $1.55 billion in fiscal \u201922 after excluding the gains. Fiscal \u201823 interest expense is expected to be approximately $110 million compared to $88.8 million in fiscal '22 due in part to higher interest rates. Our fiscal \u201923 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%. This compares to a rate of 17.9% in fiscal \u201922 after excluding the gains and their related tax impacts. The expected higher effective tax rate will negatively impact fiscal '23 diluted EPS by approximately $0.32 and diluted EPS growth by approximately 290 basis points. Our financial guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks and we remain in a dynamic environment that can continue to change. Our guidance contemplates a stable economy and excludes pandemic related setbacks or economic downturns. I'll turn it back over to Paul. Paul Adler : That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Ashish Sabadra of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could just comment on the new business trend, specifically around signing up new customers. Have you seen any changes there? And any signs of elongations of sales cycle, particularly for larger customers? Thanks. Todd Schneider : Good morning, Ashish. This is Todd. Thanks for the question. Yeah, our new business is quite robust. We continue to be very successful in converting over no programmers into our programs in all of our businesses with the exception of fire, which obviously \u2013 they were all -- everyone's a programmer in that business, but we're having really good success there. And we look at the total addressable market and it's still incredibly large and growing. So that's exciting for us. But as far as the sales cycle, I haven't seen anything that would lead me to believe that the sales cycle is elongating. We've got really good momentum in our new business. I'm very encouraged by that. And as we've spoken about in the past, some of our investments that we have made are really paying off big in the form of some of our unique products in our rental line with our Carhartt products, our Chef Works and we've got a CareFlex line of scrubs through land out that's really successful in our unique restroom lines. And then our First Aid business, just the breadth of products that we're offering is really helping us get in the door and provide great products and services to our customers. They're also seeing our investments and technology that we've made, whether it's our garment tracking that is giving us a real advantage in the marketplace, our garment dispensing that we've seen. And I've spoken about our myCintas portal, which is unique and advantage in the marketplace. It makes it easier to do business with us and that's important for our customers and gives our sales partners confidence in walking in the door. So some really good things in -- heading in that direction. Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful color and obviously great to see that strong momentum in the top line. Maybe just on the margins, the question around energy looks like, oil prices might be rolling-off here or at least the fuel prices may be rolling-off, but the natural gas prices are going up. How should we think about those puts and takes on the energy front for the rest of the year? Thanks. Todd Schneider : Yeah. So when you think about our energy spend, certainly, it's up over where we were a year over prior. It's down 10 basis points sequentially. Trying to anticipate exactly where that's going to head is challenging. Certainly, but I can tell you this, we are focused on efficiencies that we can drive in our business that will lower our needs for natural gas and lower our needs for gas at the pump. and we're leveraging those and that's helping us. That helps us with our CO2 emissions and it helps us with our efficiencies in our business and our spend. And we're confident we can continue to make strides there. So that's where exactly natural gas prices will go this winter, what's going on in Europe and other areas. It's tough to tell for sure, but we'll manage through it and we see opportunities to improve in our business and we're leveraging that. Mike Hansen : Ashish, I might add that right around 60% of our energy spend is the gas, or -- gas and diesel and the remainder is electricity and natural gas. So the natural gas is a smaller component of that energy spend. More of it is the price of the pump, which as you suggested, is coming down. Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful color. Thanks again. Todd Schneider : Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. George Tong : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. In the quarter, approximately what percentage of new business growth came from the no programmer market? Todd Schneider : Good morning, George. This is Todd. The majority of our accounts are -- come from no programmers. So that is -- that trend has been consistent over the years and continues. And in a marketplace where it's still difficult for employers to find people to work, offering a value of this and the way we handle it with uniforms is attractive for them. So it's another benefit for customers and they see that as an opportunity to attract their employees and retain their employees and we have one heck of an offering when it comes to that, that makes it really attractive for people. So I'd say those trends continue as they have in the past. George Tong : Got it. Can you provide an update on uniform demand trends from the healthcare vertical? Todd Schneider : Yeah, certainly. So the healthcare vertical is a very attractive vertical for us. It's growing nicely. Demographics are such in the United States and Canada that demand will continue. And we're seeing -- we have some unique offerings in that area with garment dispensing and our unique scrub line that makes it attractive. There's certainly other items that are -- that we rent into the healthcare market, whether it be an acute or non-acute. But we really like what we're seeing there from that demand. And I'll give you one example of a hospital that about six months ago, we sold a scrub rental program into that account. And it was a nice -- very nice sized customer that you would recognize a name. In that case, the nurses that we were providing the program to, they were wandering the products at home and the nurses voiced a concern about safety. Meaning, hey, what am I taking home? Am I wandering it? Am I wandering it correctly? And in that case, they chose Cintas because of a few things. One is, our technology that we've deployed that's unique that allows us to manage inventory for them, which provides the requisite access to the product, which is really, really important. And also helps control their costs based upon how we manage that inventory. But also improves the safety aspect of it, so separate from being an employee benefit, because those what I'll call potentially contaminated goods or scrubs. They don't go home. We laundry them appropriately via our hygienic process, hygienically cleaning process, which allows them to have the confidence that their process correctly and when that it's improved safety. And just as an anecdote, I mentioned that was about six months ago, just recently, we sold a microfiber wipe rental program to that same hospital. And so they use microfiber wipes in many ways, but the most obvious one is when they're cleaning guest rooms or patient rooms, we should say. In this case, that particular hospital they were purchasing those wipes and then they're having the, I'll call them hospital employees or EBS type folks that were cleaning those on their on-premise laundry. And in that case, they chose Cintas because it was able to -- we were able to reduce their labor costs. They're having trouble getting access to labor. And then again, we're processing those in a manner where they can have great confidence that they're processed correctly with a hygienically clean process. So you asked your original question, George, was about uniform demand in hospitals, which is quite good. But it also, there's so much that we can provide to those hospitals. And I just want to give one example to just give a little color around that. George Tong : Very helpful. Thank you. Todd Schneider : Thank you. Operator : I will now take our next question from Andy Wittmann of Baird. Please go ahead. Andy Wittmann : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, Mike, I just wanted to talk a little bit about what is implied in the guidance here. Maybe couple of different ways to think about that. But how much conservativism is baked into the guidance? And I made a couple of comments in the prepared remarks. Is there any change maybe sequentially to the guidance the way you're factoring in the macro outlook? And maybe any leading indicators that you can give us -- that gives us confidence that the economy is performing at the rate that you think it is? Mike Hansen : Well, so let me start, Andy, with the guidance. The guidance implies and we're 60 days past when we gave the initial guidance. The guidance implies really good growth through the rest of the year. But as you know, we do face some tougher comps as we saw the business pick up last year throughout the year. And so we would expect a little bit of deceleration from the growth levels of where we are, but still healthy growth and ending the year in a range of 9% to over 10%. And we like the momentum of the business today and our expectation right now is that we're not seeing any change in the value that our customers are seeing and we're not changing -- we're not seeing any change in the way in the economy, I'll say. Now -- maybe I'll flip to margins briefly. Our margin expectation remains that we will see margin improvement during the year and that range that we provided certainly contemplates that margin improvement even in a pretty challenging type of economic environment. So the guidance is a little bit better than we gave 60 days ago, part -- because of the first quarter, part because of the momentum that we see in the business. Now as it relates to -- trying to dissect what the economic picture is going to look like for the rest of the year, look, that can be pretty difficult, right? I mean, there are -- some who say we may be in a recession today. There are some who say we may be in a recession early \u201823. Some who say, we may be in a recession late in \u201823. The Fed has come out and said GDP for \u201823 is going to be 1.2%. It's hard to predict what we're going to see in the economic picture as we move forward. But what we know is that the momentum in our business today is really good. The value proposition that our customers see and our prospects see, they're reacting very positively to it. And because of that and many other factors, we believe that momentum can continue along with healthy margins. And that's what we've given you in our guidance. Does that help answer that question a bit? Andy Wittmann : It does. Thank you for that. I guess, I wanted to -- then follow-up with a question on, I guess, overall customer retention levels. Considering that you're getting above historical averages in price increases, I thought maybe it would be helpful to comment on that. And you guys have talked about the sales momentum in a couple of different ways, but if you look at sales productivity on a per head basis, is that metric up on a year-over-year basis as well? Todd Schneider : Andy, thanks for the question. This is Todd. First off on retention, yeah, retention is very good. We like where that is. We like the momentum around that. We're organizing around it appropriately to make sure that we're meeting and exceeding our customers' demands. And we like our -- the product and service offering that we have and the customers find it attractive. I mentioned some of the products and the technology that we have that are unique and the customers like it. I think they also like our approach that we took over the past couple of years about being really flexible and empathetic with them as they were going through, -- what they went through the various businesses through calendar '21 and calendar '22, -- '20and '21, I should say, with the pandemic. So I think that was -- that is benefiting us because they saw that we were -- we understood what they were challenged with and we pivoted to provide them what they needed instead of just telling them, hey, here's what you contracted to buy. So I think all that is paying off. As far as productivity in new business, yeah, we like it. It's up and we are -- certainly, we love our sales force. We think they're well trained, well positioned when sales partners have confidence in the products and the technology and the services that they're going to provide, that confidence is powerful and it's showing itself in productivity and we like that. We're also deploying up (ph) types of technology, via our investment with SAP, that's paying off in a number of ways. I'll just give you one as it relates to sales, which is investing in technology that allows for what I'll call best next prospect for a sales partner. Meaning instead of just calling blindly on businesses, we want to drive to our sales team who will be the next best prospect to call, which through analytics, we can tell them where to spend their time. And that's better for the partner, that's better for our company, again that provides more confidence. And yeah, so those types of investments are paying dividends for us. Andy Wittmann : Great. Thank you. Todd Schneider : Thank you. Operator : We can now take our next question from Tim Mulrooney of William Blair. Please go ahead. Tim Mulrooney : Yes. Good morning. We know energy was a slight headwind to margins in the quarter relative to last year, but gross margins were only down 10 basis points. So I was curious, how some of the other cost buckets are trending? How are labor costs trending? Were those a headwind or a tailwind to margins? And anything else big to point out here like maybe materials and supplies? Mike Hansen : Tim, maybe I'll start on that. From a gross margin perspective, you're right. We're down 10 basis points from last year in a period where total energy expenses are up 30 basis points. We're up 190 basis points sequentially and so we've seen some nice improvement there. And look, when you think about that rental number of 47.5% that's a really good gross margin for us. We've only been higher than that a few times and that certainly is a much greater gross margin than we saw pre-pandemic. So we like the -- where we are in that space. We like the sequential improvement in the gross margin, which is pretty good. And we're doing it while we have -- we've seen such good growth in volume over the course of the last year and we're able to be pretty flat overall in gross margins while we're investing in the business. So in other words, that volume growth over the last 12 months has, we certainly created the need for additional capacity, particularly in our laundry facilities and we're investing as we should because we certainly want to make sure we have the capacity to serve the customer. And so nothing -- I would say nothing unusual to point out in there other than we continue to make the progress that we want to make. The only other thing I might say about that gross margin is, we're seeing an all-time high in our First Aid and Safety business. And we continue to like the way that business is trending and the mix back towards that First Aid business that we love so much. Todd mentioned that the First Aid part of that business is over 20% growth still. And we've seen some really nice movement there. So again, nothing real specific to point out other than making good sequential progress and certainly continuing to invest for our future growth. Tim Mulrooney : Yeah. Thanks, Mike. I guess my follow-up will just stick on that point. The First Aid and Safety gross margin really stuck out to me in the quarter. I mean, you're almost at 50% gross margin in that business, well above what we normally see there. Are there any extraordinary items to call out there that help drive those strong results that wouldn't necessarily repeat moving forward? Just trying to understand how to think about gross margins in First Aid moving forward as we model out the business for the rest of the year? Todd Schneider : Sure. Tim, it's Todd. We're proud of the gross margin improvement that we've made in the First Aid business. It is reflective certainly of the shift of the mix of the business. But I wouldn't say that there's anything that is out of the ordinary, where you'd say, oh, my goodness. Is there something that a one timer? So, no. Now that being said, we're -- certainly there will be puts and takes of the First Aid business gross margin throughout the year, don't think of it as a linear progression upward. It's -- we're making investments. We're growing that business really attractively. We are certainly leveraging -- trying to leverage as very much as best we can. The revenue growth that we're getting, but we've got to -- we've -- as Mike pointed out in all of our businesses, we've got to invest to meet the demand. And we're doing exactly that and trying to do it as intelligently and as efficiently as possible. But we're really happy with the demand levels that we're seeing and make sure we're positioned to meet those demand levels. Tim Mulrooney : Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you, guys and congrats on a nice quarter. Todd Schneider : Thank you, Tim. Mike Hansen : Thank you. Operator : We can now take our next question from Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Please go ahead. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning. I can appreciate, obviously, all the trends are very strong today. As you said, no economic weakness you're seeing in your businesses, but maybe you can help us with typically if that does start impacting your customers, like, how quickly do you see it, how quickly do they react? And I guess what do you do in response to that? Todd Schneider : Yeah. So Manav, good question. We are not seeing it in our customer base today. And as a reminder, -- as of Friday, there'll be four months into our fiscal year. And will we see it how well -- what's this recession? Are we in one, as Mike said, is there one coming in the first half of '23, the back half? We're not trying to predict all that, but we are staying acutely aware, but we're positioning ourselves to make sure that we can grow in all types of economic cycles. And as a reminder, we've grown in 51 out of the last 53 years. The only exception being the great recession. We certainly hope that any recession that comes is not as severe as what that was. And so what I'll call in, whatever the traditional type of recession, if that comes, then we expect good performance. We expect to grow. We have traditionally grown in multiples of GDP and jobs growth in the past. Mike spoke of our products and services are highly valued. You think about cleanliness, safety, image and compliance. Those are buying motors that are stronger today than they were in the past, certainly stronger than what they were even pre-pandemic. Our products and services are more diversified today. Our customer base is more diversified today than it was in the past. Today, we're 70% services and 30% goods producing. So that diversification we think will help us. And when you think about NAICS codes, we have no three digit NAICS codes that is greater than 10%. So again, a really nice diversification there. We have also invested as we've talked about in the past calls in our vertical sales approach which we think gives nice diversification into when you think about government and you think about healthcare, higher education, those types. We've spoken about our momentum that we think is really, really good. And also our strong cash flow, we think that will allow us to be opportunistic as we -- whenever we are into a recession if that is today or in the future, we're going to be well positioned to make sure we're successful. Manav Patnaik : Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe Mike, if you could just remind us of your mix on the debt side between fixed and floating, whether you hedge just as we track these interest rate increases? Mike Hansen : Sure. We have -- as of the end of August, Manav, we've got about $500 million in commercial paper or other short term variable debt. And the rest of our debt is fixed or senior notes. We do have some of our 27 maturities the interest rates locked on those. Those are right now, as you can imagine, a fair amount in the money So that's where we are today and look that the -- we like that, we like a little bit of that short-term debt because it gives us optionality. We can pay that down if we feel like we want to or we can certainly have more space to use that if we needed to. Manav Patnaik : All right. Thank you. Operator : And we can now take our next question from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrew Steinerman : Hi. It\u2019s Andrew. I just wanted to get a quick thoughts from you about organic revenue growth for the balance of the year from kind of each First Aid, Fire, Uniform Direct. Those had particularly strong first quarters. I definitely heard your general comments about tougher comps. And like, do you think each of these three should be double-digit organic growers this year? Todd Schneider : Andrew, thank you for the question. When I think about each of our businesses, we don't give guidance based upon each of them individually, but I'll just provide some maybe some top line thoughts. I'm really -- I haven't done the calculus on what it would be for the year, but I'm just thinking about Qs two through four for each. I would think about from rental, Fire and the First Aid business all being high-single digits of the balance of the year. Keeping in mind that there was some PPE in the First Aid business in Q3 which will provide a tougher comp for sure. And then in our Uniform Direct Sale business, we're going to be up against much tougher comps. So I would think of that from high-single to flat, maybe even negative in Q4 based upon the significant comps that we're up against there, which is obviously a little bit more lumpy business. Andrew Steinerman : Just say that last part again about Uniform Direct Sale, high-single digit. And then you said flat, just -- you were talking about two through four. So just say the last part again about Uniform Direct Sale. Todd Schneider : Yes. So when you think about Uniform Direct Sale business, again, a lumpier business, high single to -- from Q2 through Q4. Think about high-singles down to closer to flat to maybe even negative in Q4, due to sales growth due to the significant comps that will be up against on the back half of the year. Andrew Steinerman : Makes sense. Thank you so much. Todd Schneider : Great. Thank you. Operator : And we can now take our next question from Faiza Alwy of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Faiza Alwy : Yes. Hi. Thank you. Good morning. I guess, I'm curious, like what has gone better than what you expected, when you first gave the guide a couple of months ago, especially as it relates to revenues. I know you mentioned better pricing and I'm curious if the pricing update has been better than expected or is that better new business? I know you mentioned the healthcare vertical in particular. So just more perspective on like what you think really drove the outperformance, specifically in the rental business? Todd Schneider : Great. Faiza, thanks for the question. It's Todd. I'll start if Mike you want to chime in. There's many contributing inputs to our positive growth that we're seeing. New business is quite good as we spoke about, but retention and penetration is very attractive as well. We continue to improve upon our cross sell. And as you mentioned, pricing is certainly playing a larger role than it did historically, as it should because of the levels of cost increase that we are seeing via whether it's labor or material cost and what have you. So I think just generally speaking, we like the key inputs that we're seeing. I mentioned earlier our diversification into those various businesses, verticals, et cetera., they're all -- we like the momentum we're seeing in all those, so pretty widespread. Faiza Alwy : Great. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on the labor environment. I don't know if you're seeing some easing in the environment in your business at this point. And I'm curious how you think about that going forward sort of, is that as a labor environment eases, is that a benefit for you? Or is that maybe more of a headwind from a competitive perspective? Todd Schneider : Good question on labor. I'd say, easing a bit, but that's relative. It is still a very challenging environment. But maybe not as quite as challenging as it was six months ago, eight months ago, but still quite challenging. And we are in constant pursuit of a tracking and retaining the very, very best people. We think that gives us competitive advantage in the marketplace. So when we look out and say, okay, what does that mean to us? We're constantly in pursuit of that. So any easing of the labor market would certainly be welcome from a standpoint of making a little bit easier to run at lower RPMs. But here's what I know is we -- our team figures it out and they have -- they are staffed at the appropriate levels to meet our customers' demand. They've done one heck of a job in fighting through all these challenges over the past couple of years to make sure that we're positioned to be successful. So whatever the environment, our team will figure it out. We've shown that they'll be in the past. We\u2019ll pivot appropriately, but -- so we'll manage through it. Faiza Alwy : Great. Thank you so much. Todd Schneider : Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from Heather Balsky of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Heather Balsky : Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. On the new customer growth front, could -- you already touched on healthcare earlier in the Q&A, but where else are you seeing some of the momentum? Are there additional verticals where you're seeing outside growth or you're targeting verticals you haven't been in the past? It'd be great to get color on that. Thanks. Todd Schneider : Heather, thanks for the question. Again, our experience is very broad in our successes that we're seeing. I'll just give you one another example that might provide a little color. In one of our verticals, where we're calling on the government sector. There's one particular city that I won't mention, but you'll know the name of it. About a year ago, we sold a uniform program into that city. And as an example there, that was into the sanitation, transportation, parts and recreation type departments. And in that case, they were using a local provider before we took over that account. And they chose us in that case because they liked our garment offering was better, meaning they thought we had better, more attractive garments that their employees wanted to wear. Our garment tracking technology help them to reduce costs, meaning less lost garments and what have you. And then as I mentioned earlier, our investment into our My Cintas web portal makes it may be easier for them to do business with us. So which reduces their administrative time and just helpful for them. So that was about a year ago and then, If you fast forward just recently, we sold them a First Aid cabinet service to all those departments and even more municipal buildings. And in that case, previously they had ordered all their first aid products online. So they were a no programmer. They were ordering it from whomever online and then they were essentially doing all that work and filling those candidates themselves. Inquisidentally, the sales lead for that opportunity came from our uniform service provider. So while they're the uniform service provider was speaking to the customer and they said, hey, we need help here. So the uniform service provider pass it on to our -- the appropriate person in our First Aid service provider. In that case, they chose us because, again, a better management of the products and we're able to help them manage the products better, improve their compliance, reduce their costs and remove their need to administer the program. So you think about what businesses are challenged with. In this case, it was a city government, but it's still, they're still running it as a business where they have to meet their customers' demands and their employees' demands. And I think another example of just how we are growing our business and why it's attractive for businesses, sticky, good retention, good cross sell and that shows itself in new business. Hopefully that color helps a little bit. Heather Balsky : Yeah. Thank you for that. And then just a question on pricing. Can you just walk us through where you are in the process of taking, I guess, this outsized pricing you've been taking? When did it start? Kind of when do you start to anniversary it? Just trying to think through the flow through as we progress over the next few quarters. Todd Schneider : Well, Heather, pricing is a local subject. It's a customer by customer subject. Meaning some businesses are doing better than others. And -- but as we look at that, when inflation kicked in to much higher degrees than that required us to make sure that our price adjustments were higher than historical as well. So you can think of about it that way when inflation was -- went to above historical levels. That's when we adjust to pricing at above historical levels. And as far as what that means moving forward, that will depend upon the -- what inflation does moving forward. So I don't have a crystal ball as it applies to that or a recession what have you, but we're paying very, very close attention to all those inputs and we'll manage it appropriately. Heather Balsky : Thank you. Todd Schneider : Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from Seth Weber of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Seth Weber : Hi, guys. Good morning. I actually had a pricing question as well, kind of a similar question. So, Todd, I guess I'm trying to understand if how much of the price increases that you guys have been pushing through are just purely tied to inflation and how much of it is, since I was just trying to get more for the value prop that you're off offering today? So I'm trying to understand, will pricing revert back to its traditional level if inflation receives? Or do you think that pricing can be structurally higher for Cintas just based on the greater value that you're offering to your customers kind of today versus history, that makes sense? Todd Schneider : Yeah, Seth. It's a fair question. As I think about our customer base, we're such a broad customer base. So some of them, we have contractual commitments, some of them we have the ability to adjust prices closer to inflation and what have you. So it's very, very broad and it really depends on the particular customer and the health of that customer as well. But here's what I can tell you is that we take a long term approach. We don't think about our customers and quarters or fiscal years, we think about them in over decades. And that approach has really paid-off big dividends for us. Now, we are constantly trying to improve the value that we provide to our customers. That being said, when inflation is at the levels it's at, it requires us to adjust prices at above historical. When inflation comes back down and we certainly hope and expect that that will occur. Then I think you can think of our price adjustments to be back closer to more historical. We're now -- am I constantly trying to improve the value to our customers? Absolutely. That pursuit will be in perpetuity and the marketplace determines how that pricing is handled appropriately. Mike Hansen : Seth, I might add two things. One, you bring up kind of the structure of our pricing and we're generally the highest price relative to our competition in the space. So in other words, we don't leave with price generally. We believe that our products, our service, they are better and that generally means we are at higher price points than our competition. And I don't expect that that would change. As Todd said, we are continuing to look for ways of even improving that value more in the future. But I don't see that type of pricing changing because of the inflation going up and down. We believe that we can command the best prices because our products are better like, car hard and other products like that and our service is just better. The other thing I might add is, our pricing is, as Todd said is customer by customer and local and it's not necessarily a -- we have to offset or we look to offset inflation immediately. Generally speaking, we want to do the best for our customers and continue to add the right value, but we also know that given the way our cost structure works, we don't have to necessarily immediately offset inflation. We get, for example, the products that we rent in our rental business, we get to amortize them, right? And so if we do have to take a cost increase, we get -- we certainly get visibility before that hits our P&L because that has to go through the manufacturing process, then it gets to our locations and then it amortizes over a period of time. And so we can have multiple price increases before that hits our P&L. And that ability to anticipate and manage our cost structure as well as our pricing, it's reflected in the fact that even in this pretty darn difficult environment, we've been able to increase our margins year-over-year, certainly, excluding those one-time gains, but we've been able to continue to increase our margins during that period of time. So I just give you that color to say, we are very thoughtful about the way we price and we are thoughtful about the way we anticipate the costs within our cost structure. And it works because we're able to increase our margins in a pretty difficult inflationary environment in each of the last four quarters. Seth Weber : Yeah. No, it makes total sense, Mike. I appreciate it guys. That's super helpful and that's really all I had today. Thank you. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. It's pretty noticeable that the cost of goods sold is up only like $10 million sequentially. But when I look at the SG&A, it's up like $46 million. And usually when you have some kind of inflationary prices, I would have thought it'd hit the COGS more. Maybe you could explain to us what the changes were in SG&A and was there some kind of significant investments in production or anything like that? And maybe if you can bring it down to kind of the unit level? Mike Hansen : Well, Shlomo, I'll speak to the SG&A piece of this. Yes, we did have some sequential increase. But Shlomo, if you look at going back to -- I've got going back to fiscal \u201815. Our first quarter SG&A is usually the highest of the year. I'll throw out the pandemic impact a year. But our first quarter is usually the highest SG&A quarter of the year and that's been consistent for a number of years. And that's simply because of some things like, we have higher payroll taxes when our equity compensation vest at that period of time. It usually happens in the first quarter. We tend to have a little bit more stock options that create more payroll taxes. We tend to have some beginning of the year meetings and other things that happen. But year-over-year, if you pull that gain out that we've been talking about, our SG&A is down 40 basis points. And so we like -- we do like the movement of that SG&A. And gosh, if you go back to pre-pandemic Q1 of 2020, we're down almost 300 basis points. If you go back to 2019\u2019s SG&A were down 260 basis points. My point Shlomo is, this is not unusual for us to have a first quarter higher SG&A because of just the way that our business works and the timing. But year-over-year, we continue to make really good performance in that. And in this case, down 40 basis points. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Thank you. And then maybe you can also talk about the higher revenue kind of translated into margin for two of the units, but for kind of the other unit, it didn't look like it's translating exactly the same way. Is there something that was -- is there a mix item in terms of what was being sold over there? And then just maybe you can just touch on your expectation for cash flow through the year with such strong revenue should we expect there to be a working capital drag. So we wouldn't necessarily see revenue grow the same way that we would see earnings grow. Mike Hansen : Shlomo, I'll talk to the All Other first. I'm not sure, if you're talking year-over-year that gain that we've referred to a number of times is in the All Other. And so you have to make sure that you're stripping out that gain 14.7% for the quarter for us that is a pretty good quarter. But as Todd mentioned a little bit ago, that Uniform Direct Sale piece that can tend to move up and down a bit and be more inconsistent from quarter-to-quarter and that's a bit of what we've seen in this quarter. So once you pull out the gain from last year where we had that outsized operating margin in All Other. We're at a pretty good spot at 14.7% and it more than anything is attributable to that lumpiness in the Uniform Direct sale business. As it relates to our cash flow, look, we like where the cash flow is where our operating cash flow is up 13.7% year-over-year. Free cash flow is up 7%. And look from quarter-to-quarter, there can be puts and takes. But generally speaking, our cash flow is really good and I expect that we'll see a continued very good conversion from net income to operating cash flow. Now, when we grow and we've been growing quite nicely, we have always been a bit of a drag in working capital because our AR tends to go up as we grow. Our uniforms in service and other items in service tends to grow -- go up as we grow and that certainly has happened. But we're still turning that into really good cash flow and I would expect that that's going to continue for the rest of the year. We're going to probably be a little bit higher in CapEx during this fiscal \u201823 year because we've -- again, we've kind of come from a pandemic period where we didn't need to grow capacity and we've really seen some nice growth over the course of the last -- more than fiscal year. And that certainly means we do some investing. And so you're going to see a little bit of an increase in CapEx, but right in the range where we've guided to that 3% to 3.5% of revenue. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Great. Thank you. Operator : And we can now take our next question from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. Good morning, guys. I mean, kind of go back to the recession question and the essence of the question is going to be visibility. It's been asked a few times on the call, but your guidance, your quarter is obviously quite strong. The guidance is certainly ambitious. And I view you guy has generally pretty conservative. So things must look really good to you right now and through the end of the fiscal year. So no one have kind of asked this, but I want to delve in a little bit deeper. When do you see when you're working with your customer or something like going back to past recessions. What are the first signs you see? How do they manifest? And what type of visibility do you have into OOK (ph) that's going to affect our numbers, weeks, months, quarters later. If you could just tell us kind of going back to pass through session, how that takes shape? Thanks. Todd Schneider : Scott, this is Todd. Thanks for the question. Mike, certainly if you want to chime in. When we think about, again, are we in a recession technical? It's one coming in early '23, late '23 how severe we don't know those items, but we are watching it very closely. When you think about our customer base, how might it show up? We'll customers if their demand is being impacted then they're going to look for ways to cut their costs. Is that in getting a no look at their P&L and say, okay, what's the biggest things I can move on? And frankly, we're not usually top of their list. So -- and the reason being is because our spend per customer is pretty small. But that being said, we'll -- will they reduce their needs for certain services, reduce quantities of products that they need. Certainly those types of things can happen if their demand is being impacted. So those are the items that we look for is, our customers reducing their needs because their demand of their business is such that they don't need as much. So I'd say that would be one of the certainly bigger categories that we look for. Mike, any other thoughts, but those are the first one that came in mind. Mike Hansen : Yeah, I think that's true. We may see some of those kinds of signs. We may see a couple of our customers go out of business depending on the type of recession. But the other thing that I think is really important is we've grown through lots of recessions in the last 50 years. And we have also sold a lot of new business through every recession. And so even if we start to see some signs that the customers are paying a little bit more attention to their spending. We know this that we're not asking them generally to spend new money. It's spend it with us and we will help them with our programs to reduce their own work content. In other words, they can -- they find their people can do more with less because we're able to take some work away from them and we're not necessarily asking them to spend new dollars. So we -- look, we're going to be paying attention to all different kinds of things within the economy, but we know this. We're going to sell a lot of new business. We're going to sell the no programmers. We're going to help our customers reduce their own work content. And that's why we feel, we not only do, we love the momentum that we have, but as we look forward, that value proposition is still resonating very, very well. We've said that a number of times and we don't see that changing And so we feel pretty good and we generally -- our guidance is a reflection of that and we like where we're headed. Scott Schneeberger : Excellent. Thanks guys. That sounds good. I think a good follow on there. You've alluded to M&A, but we haven't really discussed it on this call. How is the environment right now? Are you seeing more opportunities or is that pretty steady? Any commentary on multiples? Is that something that's what more attractive, less attractive? Thanks. Todd Schneider : Yeah, Scott. This is Todd. Our deal flow is good. We love our balance sheet, who love our position in the marketplace. That being said, those M&A type of opportunities, they -- tough to pay some, toughed there are various items that cause things to flip the switch for someone to sell their business. But I can tell you this, we're really well positioned. Love our balance sheet, love our team and the ability to manage through any M&A. And we think that that's going to be an opportunity for us in the future and we're well positioned for it. That being said, again, it's tough to pace them, but deal flow looks good and I don't see anything that's all that different from a multiple standpoint in the marketplace. So we're interested in any and all opportunities from an M&A standpoint and we'll continue to push for those. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks, Todd. Excellent. I'll turn it over. Todd Schneider : Thank you. Operator : We can now take our final question from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Toni Kaplan : Thanks. I wanted to ask a longer term margin question. If I look back about two years ago, your EBITDA margin like really meaningfully stepped up to mid-20s. But at the beginning, I think you're benefiting from travel, reduced travel during the pandemic and healthcare costs. You've really been able to keep it at that level. And I know you talked about adjusting your cost structure at the beginning of the pandemic, but basically what type of expenses have you been able to adjust so that you can stay at this mid-20s EBITDA level. Just how sustainable is it? It seems like it is, but wanted to just get some additional color there. Todd Schneider : Yeah, Tony. It's Todd, you're absolutely correct. And when we look forward, we see incremental margins. We've talked about 20% to 30% and we see that in our future. And we are leveraging certainly the top line very nicely. We manage our variable costs. I think quite well, the team is very, very good at that. But we're also getting efficiencies from some of our digital transformation that we've talked about in the past. You see that certainly energy is a big subject today, but we've talked about our Smart Truck proprietary routing technology that's helping us reduce idle time and drive time, which obviously helps with energy spend, but it helps with CO2 emissions as well. And one of the things, we talk about around here is that we don't make money when the wheels are moving on our trucks. So getting those efficiencies is very important. We're extracting other efficiencies via our investment with SAP, with our inventory control programs that are allowing us to get better reuse of our products in our stockrooms, which also helps improve turnaround time for our customers. We think it's very, very important which gives us an advantage in the marketplace. I mentioned in our last call, we have an operational excellence dashboard that provides us better transparency into the efficiency levels at each of our production facilities. So that is significant, right? So we're able to understand the efficiency levels of our facilities not by having to be there in person every day, but by understanding the metrics of our operational excellence dashboard in real time. So I guess it's a blessing that we have those opportunities to improve. It's frustrating that we have opportunities to improve, but we're focused on improving those and extracting those efficiencies. So that will allow us to continue to provide good incremental margins separate from the items that I mentioned before with some of the other technologies that we deployed with making it a better win for customers and how they're doing business with us. So yeah, as we look forward, we're going to continue to those efficiencies and provide what we think are attractive incremental margins. Toni Kaplan : Great. And on a more sort of current basis, any changes to contract structure, changes in contract lengths, any increasing the minimum thresholds for clients, anything to call out there? Todd Schneider : Tony, I would say, it's nothing out of the ordinary, certainly, we take a very long term approach with our customers. They take a long term approach with us and we make sure that, that we're positioned to meet their needs and exceed them and provide products and services that they really value. And so that's what we're doing in the marketplace and that tends to show itself in -- I\u2019ll just call it long term relationships. Others might call those contracts, but I call long term relationships with our customers. Toni Kaplan : Thanks a lot. Todd Schneider : Thank you. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back to Mr. Paul Adler for closing remarks. Paul Adler : Well, thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our second quarter of fiscal \u201823 financial results in late December. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Paul Adler : Thanks, Russ, and thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our fiscal 2023 second quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'll now turn the call over to Todd. Todd Schneider : Thank you, Paul. Second quarter total revenue grew 13.1% to $2.17 billion. Each of our businesses increased revenue at a double-digit rate. The benefits of our strong revenue growth flowed through to our bottom line. Operating income margin increased 70 basis points to 20.5% and diluted EPS grew 13% to $3.12. I thank our employees whom we call partners for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders and each other. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the second quarter of fiscal '23 was $1.71 billion compared to $1.54 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 11.3%. Revenue growth was driven mostly from increased volume. Our sales force continues to add new customers and penetrate and cross-sell our existing customer base. Businesses prioritize all we provide including image, safety, cleanliness and compliance. Challenge with labor scarcity and rising costs, businesses continue to turn to Cintas to help them get ready for the workday. Additionally, price increases contributed at a higher level than historically. We believe such a mix of revenue drivers, volume and price is healthy and supportive of continued long-term growth. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the second quarter was $236.0 million compared to $202.2 million last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 15.1%. This rate reflects the continued momentum of our First Aid cabinet business, which continues to grow more than 20%. Whether it is COVID-19 or influenza, the health and safety of employees remains top-of-mind. We provide businesses with access to quick and effective products and services that promote health and well-being in workplace. Personal Protective Equipment or PPE, while still elevated compared to pre-COVID levels, declined slightly on a sequential basis. The revenue mix-shift benefits our financial results because the cabinet service is a more consistent revenue stream and has higher profit margins than PPE. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $228.9 million compared to $184.9 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue growth rate was 18.0% and the Uniform Direct Sale business organic growth rate was 33.9%. Before turning the call over to Mike to provide details of our second quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $8.58 billion to $8.67 billion to a range of $8.67 billion to $8.75 billion, a total growth rate of 10.4% to 11.4%. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $12.30 to $12.65 to a range of $12.50 to $12.80, a growth rate of 10.8% to 13.5%. Mike? Mike Hansen : Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2023 second quarter revenue was $2.17 billion compared to $1.92 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 12.8%. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '23 was $1 billion compared to $885.1 million last year, an increase of 15.5%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 47% for the second quarter of fiscal '23 compared to 46% last year. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas and electricity were a headwind, increasing 10 basis points from last year. Strong volume growth from new customers and the penetration of existing customers with more products and services helped generate great operating leverage. Gross margin percentage by business was 47% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services. 50.5% for First Aid and Safety Services. 47.4% for Fire Protection Services, and 37.2% for Uniform Direct Sale. Operating income of $444.9 million compared to $381.2 million last year. Fiscal '23 second quarter operating income increased 16.7% and operating income margin increased 70 basis points to 20.5% from 19.8% last year. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 22.1% compared to 18% last year. The tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income for the second quarter was $324.3 million compared to $294.7 million last year, an increase of 10.1%. This year's diluted EPS of $3.12 compared to $2.76 last year, an increase of 13%. We had to overcome higher inflation, interest expense and tax rate, therefore we are especially pleased with these financial results. Cash flow remains strong on September 15th, 2022. We declared dividends and pay them on December 15th, 2022 in the amount of $117.4 million in quarterly dividends. To provide our annual -- Todd provided our annual financial guidance related to the guidance. Please note the following. Fiscal '22 included a gain on sale of operating assets in the first quarter and a gain on an equity method investment in the third quarter. Excluding these items, fiscal '22 operating income was $1.55 billion, a margin of 19.7% and diluted EPS was $11.28. Please see the table in our earnings press release for more information. Fiscal '23 operating income is expected to be in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.79 billion compared to $1.55 billion in fiscal '22 after excluding the gains. Fiscal '23 interest expense is expected to be $113 million compared to $88.8 million in fiscal '22 due in part to higher interest rates. Our fiscal '23 effective tax rate is expected to be 20.7%. This compares to a rate of 17.9% in fiscal '22 after excluding the gains and their related tax impacts. Please keep the following in mind when modeling third quarter versus fourth quarter financial results. The number of work days in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal '23 are unchanged from fiscal '22. There are 64 days in the third quarter and 66 days in the fourth. Less work days results in less revenue to cover certain fixed and amortizing costs. In last year's third quarter, First Aid and Safety sold about $15 million in COVID test kits. We don't expect that revenue to repeat this year. Uniform Direct Sale organic revenue growth rates have been very strong year-to-date, however we expect these rates to be pressured in the second half of the fiscal year as the business faces increasingly challenging comparisons. Payroll taxes reset in our fiscal third quarter, increasing our SG&A costs on a sequential basis. Our financial guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks and we remain in a dynamic environment that can continue to change. Our guidance contemplates a stable economy and excludes pandemic related setbacks or economic downturns. I'll turn it back over to Paul. Paul Adler : That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank Securities. Please go ahead, Faiza. Faiza Alwy : You've had really good results. So congratulations on that. I'm curious how would you characterize your outperformance. Has it been more because of new business? Has pricing come in sort of better than you expected? And maybe as part of that, if you could talk about your SAP program, like how much of a benefit do you think that has had over the during the course of this year? Todd Schneider : Good morning, Faiza. Thank you for your question. Yes, we, our beat on the revenue side are driven significantly by new business, it's continues to be a very attractive for us. But we are selling more items into our customer base. So it's pretty broad. I mentioned in the prepared comments that pricing is above what our historical experience has been. As you can imagine, due to the experience with inflation that we're seeing across our organization. But it is -- but the primary drivers volume growth and we're benefiting from that. We're investing for that and things are -- we like the trend there. As far as on the margin side, we are committed that we are not going to be solely focused on growing margins because of pricing. In fact, we are dedicated to finding efficiencies in our business, some of that is through revenue leverage just general revenue leverage that we get, but we are focused on finding efficiencies and you mentioned SAP certainly that technology is helping us significantly. We've had -- we've talked about our -- the digitization. Our digital transformation of our business that has been very, very important to us and we're seeing benefits whether it's in our routing efficiencies, productivity of our sales partners, be getting better reuse of our products, in-service inventory because of SAP. Those are all benefits that we're seeing and the marketplace is noticing it and it's helping us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Faiza Alwy : Great. And then as we look ahead some companies have started talking about, started sounding a little bit more cautious, as you know, a lot of economists are forecasting a potential recession. Talk about how do you, how does, you talked previously about how your business might get impacted, but talk about like what's the sales pitch during a recession. I think that would be helpful for us to hear. Todd Schneider : Great. First off, we continue to watch our customer base very closely. We're looking at all of our data to see if there's some trends that we might see if customers are consuming less and what have you. So we're watching that. Now as far as in a recession every recession that I've been -- I've experienced while at Cintas over the last 33 years, we've always sold an attractive amount of new business. And the reason being is, we hope businesses and in an environment, that we help them, position them for success as far as, if they're in the business and they have less people, then somebody still has to take care of certain functions. So we're able to sell value there. If they are in an environment where they're looking to save money, there's in many cases we're able to save them money. It's not that they are. We're always asking for increased spend. It's just redirect the spend to us. And in many cases, we're able to help customers with that instead of spending it with some other vendor or with an outsourced item that they bring it to us. And we can bring efficiencies to them. So we fully expect that we -- our new business will be attractive in any type of economic environment. Certainly, we prefer when the economy is growing robustly, but we'll find ways to be successful in whatever the environment. Operator : And our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra from RBC. Please go ahead, Ashish. John Mazzoni : Hi, this is John, filling in for Ashish. Congratulations on the strong results. Maybe just following-up on Faiza's question, could you talk more about kind of retention, as well as just what the current customer conversations are going like today? Thanks. Todd Schneider : Yes, thank you, John. I'll speak to it if, Mike, if you'd like to contribute on this subject. But, first off, our retention levels are quite attractive. We very much like where they are. We're focused on making sure that our customer is - it's why we wake up in the morning, is to take care of them, and that focus that culture is pervasive and we're making sure that our partners are positioned to be able to make sure they can take care of them and exceed their expectations. So all that is attractive for us and keep in mind we have a really broad customer base. So we serve over million customers that we see on a very consistent basis. Some are doing some are challenged in the current economic environment, whether they struggle to find people or they're struggling with the wage inflation or inflation in general and then we have other customers that are thriving in this type of environment and frankly we have everything in between. And but generally speaking, what we see are, it's still -- we still like what we see with our customer base. And I think that broad customer base is a real benefit for us. John Mazzoni : That's great color. Thank you. Maybe quickly to follow-up. Could you just talk about capital allocation and if there's any change there, just what you're seeing today in M&A given some of the more challenging headwinds with inflationary pressures? Mike Hansen : Sure, John. This is Mike and we haven't changed our philosophy in terms of capital allocation. We want to continue to invest in the business. And certainly, as we've seen the accelerated growth over the last three quarters, we are investing in the business, but we love M&A and we continue to have all of the discussions to try to keep that pipeline active, but it always takes to come to a decision and we are working those conversations hard and our expectation is that we will be able to continue in the M&A path, but that's we certainly love that option. And certainly, we -- I misspoke a minute ago on dividends. We paid a dividend in September - on September 15th, we paid another one on December 15th, and we certainly have increased the dividend every year we've gone public. We like that option as well and then the buyback continues to be an opportunistic alternative for us when we have excess cash, so no philosophy changes. We're still working all of those in the same way that we have. Operator : Our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, George. George Tong : You mentioned you're continuing to sell more items to your existing customers. Can you describe how overall customer spending behaviors have evolved with the overall economy and if sales cycles have changed at all? Todd Schneider : Thank you, George, for the question, and good morning. Again, we have a very broad customer base. And we have a very broad product offering and we're blessed to have both and as a result we're organized in a manner where we're trying to make sure that our customers know everything that we have to offer, they don't always. We've spoken in the past about how going through the pandemic was really, really challenging. One of the positive outputs of that was the fact that our customer base saw the broadness of our offering and in many cases didn't realize we had products and services that we have. So we're focused on that. We're trying to provide more value. When we do that, it is, it helps us because we're -- when we stop our truck and the invoice is larger that's good leverage for us. So we'll provide more value to the customer and we're getting leverage in that manner. So all that's positive. So as far as the sales process being elongated. We're not saying that at this point. And as I mentioned earlier, we are certainly seeing a mix out there. Some customers are struggling and some are doing quite well and everything in-between. But generally speaking the customer base continues to head in a positive manner. George Tong : Got it. That's helpful. The upside in revenue this quarter was driven I think significantly by new business. Approximately how much of the new business growth in the quarter came from the no programmer market or Uniform Rentals? Todd Schneider : Yes, good question, George. So no programmers continues to be a really great opportunity for us. The majority of our new accounts that we sell are in the no programmers section. And so we've been focused on that. We train our partners on that. And those that set of prospects sees value in what we provide. And as a result, the TAM is massive and so that's very exciting for us and we see very nice growth opportunities into the future. Operator : And our next question comes from Andy Wittmann from R.W. Baird. Please go ahead, Andy. Andy Wittmann : I guess I wanted to ask on the First Aid segment, Mike. The margins in particular I think really stood out. You made the comment that you're getting some favorable mix shift as the PPE is rolling out. Last quarter's margins were also very good. I think better than most people expected. So it feels like there's something pretty sustainable in the margin rates. Would you agree with that assessment or is there something in there that we should be aware of as we come to 2Q fiscal '24 as a tough comp or something, maybe just some detail as to what's really driving these margins that are really frankly kind of a step function better than what you put up in the past? Todd Schneider : Yes, Andy, you're right, the margins are better than historical. The mix shift has been great. We have a -- there's a number of areas where we're able to gain leverage. Certainly the new business is a very nice lever for us. The change in -- I'll call it society and the focus on health and wellness is a real tailwind for us. And so as a result of that cabinet revenue growth is very attractive for us that affects the mix, but we are also finding, I mentioned we've got -- we're finding efficiencies in throughout our business. And First Aid is included in that. And so whether it's routing technology. We've been on SAP and First Aid for a little bit longer, but we're finding efficiencies and we have a very strong supply chain that is finding opportunities to source better and improve our overall operating margins. And Mike, anything you'd like to contribute there? Mike Hansen : The only thing I might add is to specifically, Andy, nothing to call out that there is one-time or short-term in nature. It's just that the business is performing very, very well. Andy Wittmann : Great. I guess kind of similar question, different segments on the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment. Obviously, you're getting good gross margin leverage, which says a lot about all the things you've already talked about. You mentioned making investments in the business. It appears that the SG&A line and the Uniform Rental segment in particular has been seeing investments there. And I was just wondering maybe you could provide some detail as to what kinds of investments you're making or if it's maybe just still kind of return from COVID and getting some travel and T&E back in there. Maybe just a little detail about SG&A in the rental segment. Todd Schneider : Yes, Andy, good question. We're excited about the gross margin improvement that we're seeing in that business. Despite a 20 basis points headline that we're that we're up against in energy still. So, you're right, the SG&A is up. It's there is we're making investments in the business and appropriately so. Also some G&A medical costs, workers' comp and what have you are higher this quarter and there's always some puts and takes as it relates to that, but we are guiding towards for the whole year in that business, incrementals in the 20% to 30% range and we are, as I mentioned, that margin expansion is going to come in a number of ways, but revenue growth leverage, productivity, which is a broad word, right. There are so many areas where we get productivity improvements and pricing. But, yes, so we're focused on improving the margins there and we'll manage through the G&A investment, the SG&A investment as we move forward. Operator : And our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please go ahead, Tim. Tim Mulrooney : Two questions. One on labor. We've heard from others -- other industries and companies that labor availability today still remains somewhat a governor growth. I mean has that been the case for you guys? Are you holding back in certain markets due to constraints around qualified labor and just generally how would you characterize the labor availability situation today versus say last quarter? Todd Schneider : Thanks for the question, Tim, good morning. As far as labor is concerned, the -- I'll call the labor market in totality, easier, but not easy. It is still certainly challenging there. We care passionately about how that looks for our customers and how it impacts our customers. I mentioned some are struggling to staff still and as a result, that affects their business, which impacts us. So but from his standpoint of Cintas and how we're staffed that is not affecting our growth rate, it would be more about how our customers are impacted. I can tell you it wouldn't go well here. If someone said I can't grow as fast as you think I should because I can't staff. We figure that out and we think the environment that we provide for our partners where they have great opportunities and a great wage and benefits and great security and great development is a real advantage for us in the marketplace. So as far as Cintas staffing that is not slowing us up. Certainly, our customers could be impacted by that to some degree. Tim Mulrooney : That's good. That's good color, Todd. I mean, it's good to know, I mean there are some companies we've talked to that are literally dialing back on sales and marketing costs just because they can't find a labor to support the growth. So that's good to know you guys aren't in a situation. One more from me on wage rate inflation. I'm curious what that's running at approximately right now for your folks actually out on the routes and how does that compare to your historical averages? Thank you. Todd Schneider : Yes. Wage rates. I don't have an exact number to give you, but we start with the answer and work backwards. And the answer is, we've got to have great people, we've got to have really well-trained and prepared people who can help us be successful and take care of our customers. So is above historical. Yes, it is above historical but nevertheless we're focused on putting the very, very best team out on the field, so that we can take great care of our customers and prepare us for the future of this organization. Operator : And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead, Manav. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. I guess just to follow-up a little bit. There's a lot of press out there around C-Suite anxiety, right. And I just wanted to know, historically, I guess, how long before that starts flowing all the way down to kind of your direct customers on the street and how quickly can you react because your current guidance obviously is through me. And so things might be fine till then I was just curious if there is a timing element that we should be considering to. Todd Schneider : Yes, Manav, thanks for the question. Yes, we always have anxiety, right. It's part of making sure you're sharp and but nevertheless it is, we do worry about do our, as an economy, do we talk ourselves into pulling back and is that happen to our customer base and does that happen as a ripple effect and but we're not seeing it. We're again, our customer base. It's so broad. Some are doing great. Some are not. But in general we like the direction of our customer base and we in many ways we hope they don't read the press and they stay focused on taking care of their business and investing for the future. And but we'll see what that holds and how the Fed handles things and how that might impact the general economy. Mike Hansen : Manav, I might add, you go back 2.5 years to the pandemic to the beginning of the pandemic. I think we show that we can be pretty nimble when it comes to our cost structure and adapting to changes in the environment. Manav Patnaik : Yes, that's fair. And Mike maybe if I could just ask a follow-up just on CapEx and free-cash flow expectations for the year. Any changes or help there? Mike Hansen : Well, look, we -- what you've seen maybe in the first half of this year is when we grow and we've seen three quarters now straight of double-digit organic growth. So a nice actually four quarters, so a nice acceleration in the performance. And when we grow and the volumes are healthy, we certainly invest in the business and that investment can come through in the way of working capital. And so you see a little bit more working capital usage in our cash flow statement. And that's not necessarily unusual for us when we see an acceleration in the growth rate. But we like our cash flow. It will continue to be strong and this year should not be an exception to that. And that cash flow. I talked a few minutes ago about capital allocation and the cash flow that we've got going on this year will not force us to make choices. We can still do all of the capital allocation that we typically think about. So we like where we are. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead, Andrew. Andrew Steinerman : Hi, Todd, Mike and Paul. I wanted to ask a little bit about merchandise amortization, kind of given the strength of Cintas' new business, which usually has uniforms going into service. You know, how did merchandise amortization affect gross margins? I mean rental gross margins in the second quarter? You know, obviously, I know rental gross margins were up despite any effect of merchandise amortization. And do you expect rental gross margins to be up in the second half of the year, year-over-year? Todd Schneider : Andrew we -- as it relates to the amortization, certainly you've seen the growth that I've talked about a few times and that translates into more garments and other products being injected into our in-service inventory. And we love that. We love when that happens. And so we're seeing growth in the amortization. But we're able to leverage that pretty nicely so far. And you know our business well. We amortize many of those rental products. And so we have good foresight or visibility into what's coming. And that means we can plan, we can source, we can increase prices when necessary. So the visibility gives us a nice advantage in terms of how we think about other ways of operating the business. And as it relates to the second half of the year, look, we don't typically provide guidance on gross margin specifically. But certainly the guidance that we've provided contemplates improvement in our operating margins in the second half of the year and the growth that we have on the top line and all of the other initiatives and things we've got going on. They are performing well and enabling us to do that, to do that margin improvement even in a difficult period of time. Operator : And our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please go ahead, Heather. Heather Balsky : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. So your guidance for the rest of the year, I guess, for the back half implies growth probably on the sales side and the 8% to 9% range, which is moderating from what you did in the first half. I'm curious if you could just walk us through kind of where you're assuming there might be some deceleration. Is that just as you come off lapping the COVID recovery and maybe where there might be opportunity for upside just based on the strength you've seen year-to-date? Todd Schneider : Heather, thanks for the question. Yes, so a slight, but still very attractive growth. We like where that is. We're preparing for that. And but we are certainly up against some tougher comps in the back half, specifically with First Aid and Uniform Direct sale. So we'll be lapping those and but we like the growth levels and we find them quite attractive. And that's what we are preparing for. Heather Balsky : Thank you. And do you think, you know, are there areas that you're seeing in your business. You know, you've done well year-to-date. You've raised your guidance sort of I know First Aid and Safety is very strong right now. Other sort of areas in your business, whether it's certain customers like your opportunity in health care or other business lines where you're really seeing outperformance and kind of growth beyond your typical run rate. Todd Schneider : Yes, good question. So again, our customer base is very broad, but I'll tell you this that our verticals where we're investing are, you know, health care, hospitality, education, government are performing quite well and they're growing at an accretive rate to our growth. And we think we choose them wisely and invested in them appropriately. And that customer base is doing well. Within that customer base, again, you get a mix, but nevertheless in general we like that area and it's growing very attractively for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Please go ahead, Kartik. Kartik Mehta : Thank you. I mean I know you've talked about the economy a few times. I'm wondering, as you look at some of the benchmarks for your business and maybe your customers businesses. Anything that stands out either that is positive that maybe you were anticipating would decline or anything that's negative that you are anticipating would be the other way. Todd Schneider : Kartik, it's a good question. I continue to talk about how broad our customer base is. So you name it, we see it. But the scarcity of employee -- of workers is an issue. Unemployment is still at a very, very low level. There's still, I think, 10 million job openings in the U.S. economy. So as a result of that, you know, people are, I think, careful about how they're handling their employees and being judicious about that. Kartik Mehta : And then just last question. Just from an energy standpoint, obviously fuel prices are coming down. It seems as natural gas prices are coming down as well. Is the headwind you're anticipating from energy prices maybe what you anticipated at the beginning of the year when you gave guidance to now? Has that changed at all? Todd Schneider : Yes. So we still see energy as a headwind. And when you go to the pump right now, it is certainly a little bit lower than it was a quarter ago. But about 40% of our spend on energy is in natural gas for our production facilities and electric. And that is not heading in the right direction. Natural gas prices are up and electric prices are up. And so but certainly the attention more gets to everybody fills up at the pump for the most part, but not as much focus on natural gas or electric. But we're seeing it and it's I'm sure it's affecting households as well. Operator : And our next question comes from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead, Seth. Seth Weber : Hi, guys, good morning and happy holidays. I wanted to ask another margin question. Mike or Todd, I mean, the guidance for this year, the back half, it seems like you're the guidance kind of implies a higher than normal incremental margin. And I think, Todd, you mentioned the Uniform business could be 20% to 30% incrementals this year. Is this -- are we moving into a scenario where incrementals could be higher than your normal call it 20% to 25% range and maybe are you more comfortable talking in like a 25% to 30% range for the business going forward. Thanks. Mike Hansen : Well, we haven't, Seth, we haven't really changed the narrative on that in terms of the 20% to 30%. But you know as -- there are different ebbs and flows within the business. And sometimes there are periods where we are investing maybe a little bit more than in other quarters et cetera. And, you know, Todd's focused on the full year results and the longer term results. And so there can be ups and downs, certainly, based on our guidance, we are contemplating margin improvement in the back half of the year. And I don't know that it's anything that we're ready to say is a new norm. It's just simply we look at the year and say we've got some really good incremental margins in that 20% to 30% range that will cause the full year margins to go up. But I wouldn't look at it as a new normal type of a thing. It's just simply there are ebbs and flows within the business and timing of investments, et cetera. Seth Weber : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then just on the Fire business, the organic growth in the Fire business continues to be in this sort of mid to high teens range. Is that a sustainable number or do you feel like for Fire and just sort of maybe any color on really what's driving that unusually strong organic growth. Thanks. Mike Hansen : Yes, Seth, I'll take that one. We love the Fire business. It's a very attractive business for us, it's the only business we're in where every business legally has to comply with the local laws around it. So the TAM is absolutely massive. And our sales team is doing really well and we're selling into additional customers. We're selling more into our existing customers. We've got a great offering. We really like our position in the marketplace. And the team is doing a heck of a job. So, yes, we would like to continue to grow that business at double-digit rates. Can it achieve the levels that where we are today, that would be outstanding. But certainly double-digits is our focus for that business. Operator : Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead, Shlomo. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Thank you very much. I want to get a little follow-up on some of the questions on client hiring, which obviously could impact Cintas volumes. Do you feel like you really sell at a level in the organization that you get kind of an advance look at the hiring plans? Or is it really kind of you monitor it as it happens? So like in current you need to react because clients will just kind of add or subtract people kind of in the moment, but you don't -- it's not that you're getting a heads up on that. I'm just trying to understand like your view. Obviously, it's a very broad client base, but just in more generalities. And then there have been any changes, you used to talk about kind of an add stops metric. And I'm wondering if there's anything materially different in what that would look like now. Todd Schneider : Shlomo, great question. It really depends upon -- our view of the what the staffing levels of our customers will be. It really depends upon where our relationship is some they'll share with us. Hey, calendar '23, here's what we're thinking. Others, they don't depending upon our relationship levels or their planning level. And so in that case, it's a little bit more reactive. So, you name it, we have that type of experience where it's very transparent and we have a good. We can see around the corner with our expectations there. And then some are just very reactive and we have to see what's going on with their customers. So but generally speaking with add stops, I would say, we see our experiences continues and the patterns that we have in the past. And I mentioned earlier that, I don't know, certainly Q1 speaking of the economy Q1, Q2 was GDP shrunk. Q3 was slightly positive. We'll see what Q4. holds in store for GDP. It's tough to tell, if we're in a technical recession or if we're not and what calendar '23 holds in store for us. But the employment situation in the U.S. is still tough to get people and as I mentioned there's 10 million job openings. We'll see if that continues to decline. But we're trying to make sure that we're positioned to grow and but as Mike mentioned, if the economy affects our customer base in a very negative manner, we'll be prepared to pivot and manage our cost structure appropriately and we're planning on being successful in whatever the economic environment brings to us. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Thank you. Just one follow-up on just on the pricing. Is it kind of normal now for the clients to expect these pricing increases or is it are you getting any material push-back on them as this time is going on? Todd Schneider : Shlomo, as I mentioned, in our prepared remarks, pricing is -- has always been a component of our growth. Same is the - what we went through with some serious economic turbulence with COVID-19 and what have you. So that being said, we're planning on growing our business most attractively through volume growth and getting leverage there and planning on growing margins via leverage on that revenue growth and finding efficiencies in our business. That being said, it's a very competitive environment. And as we talk to our customers, they certainly challenge us. And they want us to find efficiencies in our business and not just pass along cost to them and that's what we're focused on. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, Scott. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. Good morning. Happy Holidays, everyone. First question in Uniform Rental. I'm just curious about the winning business you guys have obviously highlighted penetration of existing customers, strong volume growth, new customers. Could you speak to what is no programmer versus what is competitively won? Is there a lot of that activity right now of competitively won? And then if you could just kind of differentiate what you're seeing with large customers versus may be small and midsize in the context of that question. Thanks. Todd Schneider : Yes, Scott. I'll start, Mike, if you want to contribute on this subject there. As far as the market, the competitive market. We sell a lot of no programmers. Certainly we do take business from our competitors, but that's, we find that there are so many businesses out there that say, wow, I didn't realize that you would serve a business of my size or I didn't realize you had those types of products and services and they see great value in what we do and so we're very focused on that. As far as the customer base, the larger customers, some of them are struggling, smaller ones are certainly some of them are struggling, but I would say, generally speaking, the smaller ones are probably a little under a little bit more pressure just because it's tough to attract retain staff, pay people and at the levels that you have to be competitive in the marketplace. So that's kind of a generalization that may not be completely fair and I could give you plenty of examples of smaller businesses that are thriving. But that's kind of a generalization I thought I might share with you. Scott Schneeberger : Great. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, specifically, Uniform Direct sales, I think it was about 33%, 34% organic growth in the quarter. Very strong. I heard you mentioned on an earlier question that would be a segment facing some tougher comps in the back half of the fiscal year. If you just speak to kind of what the business activity has been there, what's driving the strong growth right now? What type of customers? Has it been particularly lumpy or is it been just a solid, broad based versus maybe just one or two big customer wins? Just a little bit more elaboration on that business line. Thanks. Todd Schneider : Sure. Good question. Very broad based. It's not one customer or a couple customers. It's very broad based. And when you think about that, that area, certainly hospitality is a big component of it, but there's other customers that are national and scope type customers. But hospitality specifically I'll speak to, yes, they're struggling to staff, but there's a lot of demand out there in the hospitality sector. And as a result they need help. And you know and when you think of that, when they're struggling to staff and they have to provide products and services, we've become a very attractive opportunity for them to sole source and to provide products that they can get quickly and that are very attractive and allow them to provide the proper guest experience that they want to provide for their patrons. Operator : And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Toni. Toni Kaplan : Thanks very much. I wanted to ask a follow-up on pricing. I know you've been sort of putting through a higher level of price than normal recently, and now it sounds like, you know, obviously you've mentioned a couple of times that volume is going to be a bigger driver to growth. But I guess my question is pricing going to be more of a normal increase versus prior years or, you know, based on, you know, like the challenging macro, although you said you're not seeing it yet, like is it going to be lower than normal or roughly around sort of a normal year for pricing in calendar '23? Todd Schneider : Yes, Toni, good question. As we think about pricing in the future, it certainly is above historical today. It's tough to predict what inflation holds in the future. But presuming that comes down, I'd say you'd see us closer to historical from a price adjustments. But it really depends upon what happens with the Fed, what happens with the economy, what happens with wage pressures are so many inputs. And that one's tough to predict. So but we're watching it very closely. Toni Kaplan : Great. And then when you think about the margin expansion implied and you mentioned sort of higher margin expansion in the back half of the year, is that like I guess how much of it is a result of like energy costs coming down from prior levels or maybe inflation having reached its peak and coming down like I guess how much of it is that versus scale or initiatives, if you could give any sort of breakdown or examples of where the margin expansion will come from? Thanks. Mike Hansen : Toni, I would say, it comes from a lot of different places and it's hard to put a number on any particular one of them. But, you know, a couple examples. Energy, we've kind of looked at that, as Todd mentioned earlier, still is a little bit of a headwind going forward. So we're not necessarily expecting we'll get a bunch of energy benefit in the second half of the year, but our revenue growth has been really strong and the performance the momentum has been good and that certainly will continue to help in the second half of the year when we grow at real nice levels like we've guided towards and like we've had in the first half of the year, that always helps our ability to drive better margins. But we've talked over the last year or so about important initiatives that we have. Those remain and continue to do well and those are things like our routing improvements through our smart truck initiative. And we have more of those, whether it is sourcing initiatives that Todd touched on in First Aid or others. But those initiatives become very important to us, too. And then there are just some timing of things, maybe some investment in the first half of the year that was really helping propel our growth and continue our momentum. That may not be at the same type of level in the second half of the year. So it's a lot of those different pieces that kind of fall together. And it's, you know, it's hard to put numbers on every single one of those. Operator : And at this time there are no further questions. I would like to turn the call back to Paul for closing remarks. Paul Adler : All right. Well thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our third quarter of fiscal '23 financial results in late March and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Take care. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Paul F. Adler: Thank you, Ross, and thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our fiscal 2023 third quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'll now turn the call over to Todd. Todd M. Schneider: Thank you, Paul. Third quarter total revenue grew 11.7% to $2.19 billion. Each of our businesses continue to execute at a high level. The benefit of our strong revenue growth flowed through to our bottom line. Excluding a gain in the related tax benefit in last year's third quarter, operating income margin increased 110 basis points to 20.4% and diluted EPS grew 16.7% to $3.14. I thank our employees whom we call partners for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders, and each other.  The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was $1.72 billion compared to $1.55 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 10.8%. While price increases contributed at a higher level than historically, revenue growth was driven mostly from increased volume. Our sales force continues to add new customers and penetrate and cross-sell our existing customer base. Businesses prioritize all we provide including image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance.  Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the third quarter was $231.6 million compared to $213 million last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 7.8%. The segment was up against a difficult revenue comparison because last year's third quarter revenue included about $15 million in sales of COVID-19 test kits that did not repeat this year. Excluding the prior year test kit sales, the organic revenue growth rate was 16%. We continue to have good momentum in our First Aid Cabinet business, which continues to grow greater than 20%.  Health and safety of employees remains top of mind. We provide businesses with access to quick and effective products and services that promote health and well-being in the workplace. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the all other segment. All other revenue was $242.2 million compared to $194.3 million last year. The fire business revenue was 105 -- $155.8 million and the organic revenue growth rate was 20.7%. Uniform Direct Sale business revenue was $86.5 million and the organic growth rate was 32%.  Now before turning the call over to Mike to provide details of our third quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $8.67 billion to $8.75 billion to a range of $8.74 billion to $8.80 billion. The total growth rate of 11.3% to 12%. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $12.50 to $12.80 to a range of $12.70 to $12.90, a growth rate of 12.6% to 14.4%. Mike? J. Michael Hansen : Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2023 third quarter revenue was $2.19 billion compared to $1.96 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 11.8%. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was $1 billion compared to $898.2 million last year, an increase of 15.1%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 47.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to 45.8% last year, an increase of 140 basis points. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas, and electricity were a tailwind, decreasing 15 basis points from last year. Strong volume growth from new customers and the penetration of existing customers with more products and services helped generate great operating leverage. Gross margin percentage by business was 47.1% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 51.6% for First Aid and Safety Services, 48.5% for Fire Protection Services and 35.8% for Uniform Direct Sale. Operating income of $446.8 million compared to $407.6 million last year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue was 20.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to 20.8% in last year's third quarter. Fiscal 2022 third quarter operating income included a $30.2 million gain on an equity method investment transaction. The gain was recorded in selling and administrative expenses. Excluding this gain, fiscal 2023 third quarter operating income as a percentage of revenue was 20.4% compared to 19.3% in last year's third quarter, an increase of 110 basis points.  Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 22.1% compared to 18.2% last year. The fiscal 2022 third quarter equity method investment transaction included a significant tax benefit. Excluding the transaction, the effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was 19.6%. Net income for the third quarter was $325.8 million compared to $315.4 million last year. This year's third quarter diluted EPS of $3.14 compared to $2.97 last year. However, fiscal 2022 third quarter diluted EPS contained $0.28 from the gain on the equity method investment transaction, which included a related $0.07 tax rate benefit. Excluding this gain and the related benefit -- the related tax benefit, fiscal 2023 third quarter diluted EPS of $3.14 compared to $2.69 in last year's third quarter, an increase of 16.7%. Cash flow remains strong. On December 15, 2022 we paid shareholders $117.4 million in quarterly dividends, an increase of 18.6% from the amount paid the previous December.  Todd provided our annual financial guidance related to the guidance, please note the following : fiscal 2022 included a gain on sale of operating assets in the first quarter and again on an equity method investment in the third quarter. Excluding these items, fiscal 2022 operating income was $1.55 billion, a margin of 19.7% and diluted EPS was $11.28. Please see the table in our earnings press release for more information. Fiscal 2023 operating income is expected to be in the range of $1.77 billion to $1.80 billion compared to $1.55 billion in fiscal 2022 after excluding the gains. Fiscal 2023 interest expense is expected to be $112 million compared to $88.8 million in fiscal 2022 due in part to higher interest rates. Our fiscal 2023 effective tax rate is expected to be 20.7%. This compares to a rate of 17.9% in fiscal 2022 after excluding the gains and their related tax impacts. Our financial guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks and we remain in a dynamic environment that can continue to change. Our guidance contemplates a stable economy and excludes significant economic disruptions or downturns. I'll turn it back over to Paul. Paul F. Adler: And that concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead, Manav. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning. I was just hoping you could talk about -- clearly, you had strong results in the quarter, so I assume all the trends that you're hearing from your customers were solid but have you seen any changes more recently with all the events that have occurred out there in the banking world and if that's impacting kind of the small business confidence where you guys have more kind of exposure to? Todd M. Schneider: Good morning Manav. Thanks for the question. It is -- we're watching it very closely. Certainly, there's rumblings when you read the newspapers every day and what's going on in the marketplace, but our customers seem still quite solid. And it's always a very competitive marketplace, and we're competing quite well there. They like our products and services, and we help them run their business better. So -- and help free them up to take care of items to where they can focus on their business. So we like our value proposition and -- but we certainly prefer an environment where our customers are in a great strong economy. But we're not seeing it just yet. And -- but we're certainly watching it very closely and monitoring it and making sure that we're focused on providing great value for our customers. Manav Patnaik : Got it. And then just as a follow-up, the growth has obviously been pretty strong, better than I think what we were expecting to, but you said most of that growth was mostly volume. And so I was just wondering on the volume piece, is it that you're taking maybe more share than normal? Or is it just that these businesses are starting to get back to more normal capacity, and so there's more of that volume recovery that's aiding that? Todd M. Schneider: Yes, it's a good question. There's a whole lot of inputs to our success in growing our revenue at the levels that we're growing at, and it is exceeding our expectations. Certainly, new business is quite good. We really like that. Our retention levels are very attractive. Cross-sell that we've spoken about in the past is continuing to improve. And as we mentioned, pricing is above historical, but the volumes are really coming from the three areas that I mentioned. Keep in mind, the majority of the new accounts that we sell are new to our segment, meaning we call them new programmers, so we're growing the pie, not taking -- just taking share. We certainly love to do both, but growing the pie has been something that we are quite good at and have done consistently over the years, and we still -- we think the future is quite bright there. Operator : And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead, Andrew. Andrew Steinerman : Hi. Without just one quarter left in the fiscal year, I just wanted to ask what the organic revenue growth year-over-year for the fourth quarter 2023 is implied in the upgraded fiscal 2023 guide? J. Michael Hansen : Andrew, the fourth quarter guide would contemplate 6.5% to 9.5% revenue growth. But keep in mind, we've talked a lot about the direct sale business, which grew 32% in the third quarter, and it is coming up against tougher comps. And so we just don't see that kind of growth continuing and settling back into what we would say is a typical growth rate for direct sale in that low single digits. So that's the primary change that we see in the fourth quarter. Andrew Steinerman : Right. And so for the rental business, you're expecting a similar growth rate in the fourth quarter than you had in the third? J. Michael Hansen : Well, I'll say this, Todd, just talked about the -- we haven't seen much change in customer behavior and the demand has still been really good and the momentum in the rental business is good. And while I'm not ready to say we're guiding to a specific number, we don't see much change to it coming into the fourth quarter. Momentum still is strong. Operator : And our next question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, Faiza. Faiza Alwy : Yes. Hi, good morning. I was hoping to talk a little bit about -- you've historically seen your results have accelerated beyond what the [Technical Difficulty] would suggest, and you've talked about new verticals and the benefits at the implementation. So curious, how much more run rate do you see in both of those areas as we look ahead to next fiscal year and potentially [Technical Difficulty]? Todd M. Schneider: Faiza, I'll start, and then Mike can certainly chime in. As far as our results are quite good, we usually do grow in multiples of GDP. And -- but we like where we are and where we're heading. Regarding SAP, we're very much in the early innings of SAP. That is the umbrella of our technology investment or the digitization of our business. And we went through all the implementation, which we're still -- there's always work to be done there. But nevertheless, we're seeing benefits from our technology investments. Our customers are seeing benefits from our technology investments. And we certainly love when we derive efficiencies from technology, but we get even more excited when our customers see benefits, giving us a competitive advantage in the marketplace. So we've talked in the past about the certain advantages that we get with technology investments. My Cintas portal is one of the more obvious ones that the customers see an advantage. They get to be able to manage their account. They make request the majority of our requests are done outside of normal business hours. So our customers don't always just want to be able to deal with our service provider in person or call our office during normal business hours. So they like to be able to do the flexibility to do business on their time and to get things off their list and move it on to ours. And that portal allows that flexibility for them and it's showing up in customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. So yes, very much on the early innings of our technology deployment, I can certainly speak more to that, if you like. J. Michael Hansen : Before you get into that, Todd, I just might remind -- provide a reminder that, look, we love the market opportunity also for our business. And it's -- we look at it as a very, very big opportunity. So in other words, when we talk about we have a little bit over 1 million customers, there are 16 million customers or 16 million businesses in the U.S. and Canada, we're just continuing to try to highlight that there is a great market opportunity, and Todd brought up the point that when the majority of our new business is expanding the served market or tapping into that large market potential, it means that we can grow in those multiples of GDP and employment growth for a long period of time. I think it's important to keep that in mind as you think about the growth potential over the longer term, that market opportunity is great. Faiza Alwy : Great, that's really helpful. Maybe on the -- I mean, I would love to hear more about the technology so I'll leave it up to you in terms of how much more you'd like to share. But maybe specifically on the healthcare vertical, could you talk about what the growth trends have been like there, what they were like this particular quarter and sort of how they've been trending? Todd M. Schneider: Certainly, the healthcare business is a great vertical for us. We have spent years organizing appropriately around that with our service providers, our sales partners, and we've organized around products and services that they find attractive. And so a good example of that is -- let me back up, so our growth rates are very attractive there. They're in excess of where we're running in totality and they're primarily due to what I just described, but also some specific products that we have launched. And we've spoken a little bit about the scrub business. When the scrub business historically was not a real attractive business for us and the reason being it was low-quality products, heavy low margin, and just they were kind of not treated as a disposable, but pretty close to a disposable product. And we changed the game on that when we launched our garment dispensing service there, which controls the inventory levels for our customers. And here's the big thing is it what it -- because the technology controls it and only allows what the administrator of the hospital says each person can get, then what allows us to do is to provide a higher quality product but not be dealing with such low cost, low margin products. The customer is happier, we control the cost so much better because the inventory is controlled. So that's a great example of one of the innovations that we brought to the healthcare industry. That certainly is a technology that people value, and it's helping us grow that business really attractively. And we're still very much in the early innings of that. So hopefully, that gives you a little more color. Operator : And our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead George. George Tong : Hi, thanks, good morning. I wanted to dive a little bit more into the selling environment. Can you discuss what you're seeing with client sales cycles, budgets, and client headcount and what the implications are for the business? Todd M. Schneider: Yes, thanks for the question George. I would say that the selling environment is very similar. It has not really changed much. Sales cycles, they're not elongating the -- what's going on with our customers, they're still fighting to bring people on to make sure that they're providing the right levels of service. And in these types of environments, we help provide value to them. We provide a benefit to them running their business. And in many cases, we're able to help customers save money from what they were doing. So I spoke earlier about when you walk into a customer and they're not a programmer, well they still have products that -- probably that they have procured on their own kind of a do-it-yourself and they're struggling to keep up with that. And in many cases, because of our scale and our ability to source products and the fact that we are already there, servicing them in many cases, we can provide great value for them and actually help lower their costs. So -- and we've seen that throughout the years, and that's a real benefit as we go through trying to provide value for our customers. So, generally speaking, George, I would say the selling environment is pretty similar -- not a whole lot of change over the past six months or so. George Tong : Got it. That's helpful. And as a follow-up, you increased your full year guidance pretty much across the board. How much of that increase was driven by fiscal 3Q outperformance versus your internal expectations compared to a stronger fiscal 4Q outlook? J. Michael Hansen : George, I don't know if I can specifically separate the guidance raise. But clearly, we had a nice third quarter and the performance was strong from the organic growth to the gross margins to the operating margin. So a pretty solid quarter all the way through. And our guide for Q4 would suggest we expect more of the same. So the guide would suggest we expect another nice quarter. Hard to separate though for us exactly what the difference is because our internal expectations are a little bit different than our external, I'll say, consensus and guide. Operator : And our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Please go ahead Stephanie. Hans Hoffman : Hi, this is Hans Hoffman on for Stephanie. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask on margins, specifically the First Aid and Safety gross margin. Obviously, really strong and almost 52%. Is that just a function of kind of lower margin PPE sales rolling off and higher-margin cabinets business kind of becoming a larger part of the mix or is there anything else kind of to call out on the performance there and how should we be thinking about margins in that business on a go-forward basis? Todd M. Schneider: Yes, Hans, it's a good question and good morning. Certainly, we're very happy with the trends that we're seeing in the gross margin in the First Aid business, but we're very happy in general with the First Aid business. It is -- execution is at a very high level. Certainly, the mix of business is we're benefiting from since PPE sales and safety sales tend to be lower margin, but there is strong demand for what we are providing. Health and Wellness is resonating in the marketplace. The mantra that we have in that business is what's more important to a business than the health and safety of their people. So -- and that is resonating. And so we're getting good leverage from the growth and the mix, but strong execution and we really like how we're operating in that business. Hans Hoffman : Got it, thanks. And then just for my follow-up, I wanted to ask on the -- all other segment. Clearly, really strong growth there in the quarter. And I know last quarter, you guys kind of talked about tougher comps, specifically in the Uniform Direct business in the second half of this year. I was just kind of curious what kind of drove the strong performance this quarter, as I think a lot of us kind of expected that to kind of show up in Q3? Todd M. Schneider: Yes. It's -- certainly, the comps in Q4 are quite challenging and as Mike mentioned, we do expect that to moderate. The Uniform Direct Sale business is a little lumpier and sometimes, things come through based upon customer demand a little faster or what have you. But certainly, the comps in Q4 are tougher, and that's part of our guide. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann from R.W. Baird. Please go ahead Andrew. Andrew Wittmann : Yes, great, thanks. And good morning everyone. I guess I was hoping, Mike, you could talk a little bit about some of the relevant inflationary factors that are driving so much, the stress in the overall economy. But specific to your business, I was wondering if you could talk about the -- basically the COGS or merchandise costs, whether it's for uniforms, mats or the ancillary services that you provide as well as address how labor is progressing in your business, have those things generally been -- have you been able to get leverage on those items despite the challenges, in other words, are those down as a percentage of revenue in the quarter, can you just talk about the trend lines that you're seeing in those if there's any moderation or acceleration in them? J. Michael Hansen : Sure. So I'll start with material cost, Andrew. Let me start with we source or direct the sourcing of more than 90% of our volume and more than 90% of our items have more than one source. And that's really important to keep in mind so that when our vendors may have inflationary pressures on them, the thing to remember is we have choices. And so sometimes that means we do have to take increases, but many times, it means we have -- we can flex and we can negotiate and we can -- again, we have choices. And so we don't always have to accept every vendor price increase that comes our way when we direct to sourcing ourselves and when we have multiple sources, that's really important. The other thing is, obviously, the amortization of this bucket of expenses allows us to see ahead, to anticipate what's coming.  So as you can imagine, when a vendor does come to us and has a price increase, that -- it takes a while to, first of all, build the inventory and then it goes to our distribution centers. And then for after a turn, it comes into our rental locations, and that's where the amortization starts. And in month one, we have 1/18th of that inflation for garments, for example, 1/48th of that for entrance mats. And so you can kind of get a feel for it. It takes a long time for those inflationary pressures to come to us. That means we can do lots of planning. We can think about initiatives that we have going on, and we can accelerate some of those. We can think about process improvement and we can implement those, but we can also give in at least one annual price increase and maybe multiple price increases before that full inflation hits us. So we can really get ahead of that kind of cost. So we have choices, and we can really see ahead of that. And that gives us a really nice opportunity to plan the business without a lot of disruption.  The other thing I'll say, Andrew, is we've got a lot of infrastructure. We've got a lot of facilities and trucks and things, rents. And those aren't quite as disrupted by inflation or at least immediately. And so again, we can get with our great growth, we can get some really nice leverage on that part of our cost structure. And then when you think about labor that you touched on, Andrew, we certainly want to make sure that we are maintaining the absolute best partner engagement that we can, and that means we like to be at market or slightly above market rates, that's important for us in terms of the labor rates. But we've talked about -- we've had a couple of things happen over the course of the last five or six years. One is, we had a lot of gene case synergies being realized over the course of the last six years, and that allowed us to be a little bit more aggressive on raising rates. So we were never caught flat footed in terms of when the labor challenges hit. That was -- that's been important to us, and it's been -- it has allowed us to kind of keep disruption down.  But the other thing is, we've talked a lot about initiatives like Smart Truck. We talked a lot about the technology impacts in our facilities that allow us to be more efficient. So that means as we are growing, we don't need to add as many resources within the plants or on the routes, and that allows us to leverage that labor environment even in this period of time where we've got raising labor rates. Todd M. Schneider: Mike, if I can add, Andrew, certainly, in this type of inflationary environment, it's challenging to grow gross margin. We've been quite successful in doing so. Getting good leverage on that revenue has been key for us. But managing our variable costs, it's -- that is just simply part of our culture, managing it very, very closely. So that's been big. But to Mike's point, in leveraging some of our digital transformation, Smart Truck has been very important to us. And then also the -- managing our inventory at our used stock rooms has been really important. And we have good systems in place there that allows us to get better reuse, which is better for the customer because the speed at which we can provide products goes up because it's right there available locally, don't have to get it from a distribution center and ship it into us. And it also, obviously, helps the amortization schedule when you can get better reuse of that current product that you're already paying for. So, the leverage that we're getting as a result of the systems and processes we put in place with technology have -- are paying off. Andrew Wittmann : Great, that's helpful. I guess just for my follow-up, I wanted to ask about, I guess, the balance sheet, Mike. I mean by -- in the next quarter or two, you'll be at about one times leverage, which is on the lower end of where you've historically run the company. And with the company doing effectively $2.2 billion of EBITDA and growing, there's a cash flow being very strong, you're going to have not only the ability to leverage the balance sheet plus the cash coming in, that's a lot of capital to deploy. How do you deploy that capital in a world where we haven't seen that amount of capital being -- having been deployed really since you guys did G&K, like you said six years ago, how do you keep the balance sheet geared appropriately and what are the opportunities that are out there for you? J. Michael Hansen : Well, the first thing that I'll say is the most important thing for us is to make sure that we're investing in the right way for a long-term success of the business. And so we want to make sure that we are growing capacity as needed with our growth, that we're training our partners, that we're doing the things that we need to do to continue to grow long term. We are still -- we still want to be very acquisitive. It's hard to pinpoint when those may or may not happen, but we want to continue to be acquisitive. We talked about the dividend a little bit and that we've raised it almost 20% this past year. And certainly, while we didn't do any buybacks in the last quarter, that remains an opportunity for us as we look forward. Andy, we want to make sure that we are prudent in the way that we invest our cash. And so sometimes that means we may take a little bit longer to deploy cash but we want to make sure more than anything. Job number one is, long-term growth of the business, both on the top line and on the bottom line and are we doing the right things in order to make that happen and then prudently look for ways to enhance that. Operator : And our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please go ahead Tim. Samuel Kusswurm : Hey, this is Sam Kusswurm on for Tim. Thanks for taking my questions here. I guess to start on the margin side, lower energy costs were 15 basis point benefit during the quarter. I'd imagine this dynamic is going to continue for the next few quarters. I was wondering if you could help frame for us the pacing and size of any benefit you're expecting, if you have any color to provide there? Todd M. Schneider: Well, certainly Sam, we watch the energy prices very closely. Fuel, as in diesel and gasoline, hasn't changed that much year over prior. Natural gas, we're watching, and we expect that, that will be a benefit in the near future and the electricity it doesn't change a whole lot. So I wouldn't say that you can count on significant tailwind there. We are certainly not when you think about energy as a percent of sales, I think we came in at 2.15% energy as a percent of sales. So we like when they're coming down, and we manage it as they're going up, but I wouldn't expect a real change there. J. Michael Hansen : Yes, just to frame it a little bit, Sam. Last year in the fourth quarter, our total energy was 2.5% of revenue. In the first quarter, it was 2.4%. This time, it was 2.15%. So we may see a little bit of a benefit in Q4 and Q1. But boy, we've worked so hard to get this to be such a small part of our cost structure that I'm not sure the benefit is going to be that significant one way or the other. Samuel Kusswurm : Got you. I appreciate the color there. I guess for a follow-up, you've spoken before about Smart Truck and I think you just mentioned the question previously for the riding software. Now it's been over a year since kind of for filling it out. I guess I'd be curious if you could help quantify a benefit to your margins and if you still think there is a sizable benefit remaining there from further durations or adoption? Todd M. Schneider: Yes. Good question, Sam. Yes, we absolutely see opportunities still to come with Smart Truck. It's -- one of the things that we are very careful about is it's -- when you route a new customer, that's one thing. But when you are rerouting your existing customer base, we're very judicious about that because changing the face of the service provider can sometimes bring issues, meaning they love their service provider and now you change it. So you got to be really careful with that. So you're going to see -- I would expect benefits in that area for years to come. And that shows up in energy, in emissions, but it shows up also in productivity because our partners have more time to spend with the customers and they can provide more value to the customers. And as one of the things we talk often about here is, we don't generate any revenue when the wheels are moving. It's only when the wheels stop. So we're very focused on that, but you're going to see it, I think, for years to come. Operator : And our next question comes from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead Seth. Seth Weber : Hey guys, good morning. Hey Mike, I just wanted to ask about free cash flow. It was a little bit below what we were looking for in the quarter. Is that -- do you feel like just a transitory function of revenue growth ramping a little bit better, and you're just kind of getting a little bit behind on working capital or can you just talk us through how you're thinking about working capital going forward? Thanks. J. Michael Hansen : Well, I'll say free cash flow, I think your point is a good one from the perspective of -- it's a little bit transitory, but in the way of, look, we're coming off of a fiscal 2021 year where there wasn't a lot of growth and then really getting some nice acceleration into fiscal 2022 and 2023. And so there is a little bit of -- as we have used capacity through the pandemic, we've gotten back into a time period where we need some capacity here and there. And we've been really good at managing the capacity in many different ways, whether it is, for example, better efficiency in our existing wash alleys to adding a washer to adding a dryer to maybe then adding a new facility. But we've gotten to the point where it's time to add capacity again, and that's healthy. But I would call that there is a little bit of a mismatch there that we're catching up a bit from that. Having said that, look, we still expect free cash flow to be very, very strong. And whenever we're growing nicely, we're going to use some working capital. That's just the nature of our business. And that's a good thing. But you're right, there's a little bit of a catch-up in our capital expenditures, and we'll start to I'll say, those will get more in sync as we go into the next year and following years, assuming there's no other economic disruption. Seth Weber : Okay, that's helpful. And so do you think CAPEX could go back to that 4% of revenue range where you kind of work towards the end of the last decade or -- and then it went to like 2% a couple of years ago, I'm just trying to understand where...? J. Michael Hansen : Yes, it's going to be close -- we certainly don't expect it to be down at that 2% level. It's going to be closer to that 4% level as we think about moving forward. Operator : And our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please go ahead Heather. Heather Balsky : Hi, thank you. You talked a fair amount during the call about your success with new customers and that a lot of them are what you call non-programmers. And I think a key theme that's been discussed on multiple calls is the shift to outsourcing and an acceleration kind of in that trend. I'm just curious, as you kind of look to what happened in the third quarter and as you're looking out, kind of your thoughts on how that trend continues, do you see it normalizing, or do you think there's further momentum into the next few years? Thanks. Todd M. Schneider: Yes, good morning Heather. I'd say that trend continues. There's still people, our customers still are -- there's still 10 million job openings, folks trying to attract talent and trying to run their business and provide the levels of service that their customers expect. And when we have the ability to outsource items for them at very competitive rates, and again, in many cases, because we're already there, then that makes it quite attractive. And it's one of these like, oh my gosh, you can take this off my plate, then please, take it off my plate. And we leverage that and we'll continue to leverage that. So economic cycle aside, customers still need to take care of their customers and we can help them do exactly that. So we'll be focused on providing that value and managing our cost structure so that we can do it at very competitive rates. Heather Balsky : Great, thank you. And I guess as my follow-up, you discussed earlier that you are looking for M&A opportunities, although you don't know kind of when those might occur. I'm curious, can you talk about your priorities with regards to M&A, are there white space areas you want to fill in, is it geographic opportunities, just what are your priorities? Thanks. Todd M. Schneider: Yes, good question, Heather. So we're interested in M&A, certainly in our rental business, in our First Aid business and our Fire business. And we make acquisitions every year, every quarter, it seems in each of those businesses. But they're usually reasonably small. Some of them are geographic expansion, some of them are tuck-in. So it's a real mixture. And M&A tends to ebb and flow a bit. It's tough to predict timing, but we're interested in M&A in all those businesses. They have to be the right businesses, meaning well-run businesses, but large, medium, small, we are interested in all and each of those businesses. Operator : And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead Toni. Toni Kaplan : Thanks so much. Wanted to ask about your staffing right now, are you being more cautious now because of the environment or not because I know you mentioned you haven't really seen a slowdown yet in your customer base. So maybe nothing has really changed, so I just wanted to think about how you're thinking of staffing going forward? Todd M. Schneider: Yes, Toni, [Technical Difficulty] today. The labor market in general is easier than it was six months ago. It's certainly not easy still. And so we're focused on staffing at the level to make sure that we provide really good customer service. And so that's where we are. We will adjust accordingly if the economic cycle changes. And we're watching it really closely, as you can imagine, to make sure that we're providing the right service, the right value to our customers. But we certainly have a watchful eye out to understand if demand starts to change based upon what's going on in the broader economy. Toni Kaplan : Terrific. And I wanted to ask about pricing. You mentioned a couple of times on the call that price contributed more this quarter versus in the past. And so is that -- I just wanted to understand, is this a function of you had been raising prices a lot and now you are sort of at -- and you're still raising or like is the rate of change on pricing still higher versus before or it's just the prior price increases still coming in? Thanks. Todd M. Schneider: Yes, Toni. So our pricing, it varies based upon -- pricing is a local subject. So we handle it differently in different businesses and different geographies. So that being said, yes, our pricing is above what it has been historically. That being said, the volume growth is the majority of our growth. And the reason being is the inflationary environment is such that we have to pass on a larger price increase than we do historically. Fortunately, the customers are -- they understand that. They understand the environment, and we've been very successful in providing the right levels of service so that they are open to those adjustments. We're not here to give guidance beyond Q4 but certainly, if the work of the Fed is such that it brings inflation down, then we'll manage our business accordingly to match that. J. Michael Hansen : Toni, I might just add that the pricing that Todd talked about earlier is relative to historical levels, not -- we were not pointing out that there is a sequential increase in that level of pricing. So if that's where your question might have been coming from, it's really that relative to the historical levels of pricing. We're certainly above that, but not a real change in practice sequentially. Operator : And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Please go ahead Shlomo. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, thank you very much. I want to ask back on kind of the questions Manav was asking about initially. Just in terms of the client base that you have, it's interesting like the ADP National Employment Report is talking about small businesses have been shedding jobs basically since August. Are you not seeing that at all in your client base or is it that you just skew more towards midsized and larger clients, I just want to get a little bit further into how to read some of the kind of economic reports versus the very strong results that we're seeing at Cintas? Todd M. Schneider: Yeah, thank you Shlomo for the question. We have a really diverse customer base. And so no, we are not more geared towards the medium-sized -- small, medium, large customers, geographic, different verticals. We have a really diverse customer base. And when you think about our business now, it is more geared towards the service economy than it is just goods producing. And so you name it, we've got it. We've got some small customers that are struggling. We've got some that are thriving. And that is really more dependent upon their business, there maybe -- their particular environment. And the same goes for the medium and the larger customers. It's a real mix and we work with them. So we have a customer who is particularly struggling, then we pivot and try to adjust accordingly. If their demand is such that it's coming down, then we pivot and handle it accordingly. But again, we also have other products and services that they might be procuring elsewhere where we might help them and provide cost savings to them. So, it varies based upon the customer but we are focused on providing that value and we will continue to focus on that. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, great and then just following up on Toni\u2019s question on the pricing, is there any change at all in customer behavior in terms of the continued pricing, is there any more pushback or its kind of the same that you have had over the last say two to three quarters? J. Michael Hansen : Yeah, well there is always pushback from customers, always have and always will be. The current environment with inflation levels make it an opportunity for us to do so better than historical, larger than historical. But I wouldn\u2019t tell you that the environment has changed dramatically. But certainly inflation is starting to, it appears to come down and so we are managing our business accordingly and we will manage our customers accordingly as well. Operator : And the next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead Scott. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks, good morning everyone. I guess, on -- the focus on margin question, could you provide a little bit of attribution, a 110 basis points just operating income improvement year-over-year is really impressive, could you kind of provide what was that via the topline as opposed to where were you getting efficiencies on the cost lines, and maybe elaboration to the extent you are able of what was Smart Truck, what was just automation in the facilities, what was SAP, really, that's where the question is focused on the cost lines, where are you getting the most benefit presently? Thanks. J. Michael Hansen : Well Scott, look, it starts with great growth. And when we are growing our top line at healthy levels, we're going to get some nice leverage. I talked a little bit about in a previous response, I talked a little bit about that the cost structure of having some costs that are a little bit in that infrastructure type of a bucket that when we grow real nicely, we get some great leverage. And that happened in all of our businesses. The growth that we saw in the third quarter was broad-based in all four of our businesses, and that leads to some really nice leveraging in each of those businesses. I talked a little bit about that amortizing aspect of material costs, particularly within the rental business, and again that allows us to see things coming, and it allows us to plan accordingly. And so again, the growth helps in that area, but it also allows us to think about things like process improvements, Smart Truck that you mentioned. And in all of our businesses, we've got those kinds of initiatives. And all of them are -- we're hard at work in all of them. And so we're seeing benefits from process improvement. Some are just simply better improvements, better training, and some are technology related, like the Smart Truck. We've got all of them in each of the businesses, and that is adding to it.  Now certainly, the First Aid margin moving from 12.4% last year to 20.4% this year, there is the mix benefit that we're certainly getting in that space. But we also have lots of other good things going on in there. We are sourcing better in First Aid and Safety. And we do have some really nice process improvement opportunities going on there, and we've initiated Smart Truck in the First Aid and Safety business and in the Fire business. So certainly, First Aid has been a big part of that margin improvement, but we've seen it all. So it's hard -- I don't have specific numbers to give you, Scott, but it starts with great growth and leverage and then we get into better sourcing, process improvement, technology gains, and certainly then healthy mix. All of those things have contributed. Todd M. Schneider: Scott, I'd just like to add, certainly what Mike was talking about, it starts with great growth. That is so critical to us. But part of our culture here is we're focused on extracting inefficiencies out of our business. And we've -- and I spoke earlier that there's a lot of inputs to revenue growth, and there's a lot of inputs to margin improvement. And Mike went through a list, which was pretty darn comprehensive. But generally speaking, the -- I'll just say that we're focused on and we're not going to just grow through pricing, and we're going to find a way in these types of environments to extract the inefficiencies so that we can grow margins, which in these type of inflationary environments are certainly is very challenging, but the team is doing a heck of a job, and we're quite proud of it. Scott Schneeberger : Sounds good, I appreciate the overview. Sounds like a lot of good momentum. You all touched upon My Cintas portal earlier. It sounded like maybe a little bit more you're willing to share. Just curious what percent penetration do you have there, where do you anticipate that to go? And you mentioned that gets used at all hours of the day, but I'm just wondering what inning are we in, and any quantification of benefit of if customers are using that, how much more is that efficient in financially if there's anything you can share on that? Thanks. Todd M. Schneider: Yes. Certainly, Scott. It is -- you're talking about changing behavior within customers. So it tends to be a higher percentage of new customers that are coming on board that are participating at a high level. And the reason being is, it's new behavior, period. So then changing the customer -- the current customer behavior takes longer. And because they're used to a certain way of how we're doing business and some are leaning into it faster than others. But we're -- we see a very long runway here of benefits that we're going to get. And where does it show up? It shows up in so many places, but certainly trying to be easier to do business with is a focus here, and it makes it easier to do business with us. So I think you'll see that benefit for years to come. J. Michael Hansen : It's a little bit of an evolution with My Cintas in that a customer starts to use it and they like the benefits. And so there's -- they then start to grow in the way that they use it and expand. And as we continue to see that growth too, we can add more options and other functionality to that, that over time grows and grows. And so this is not a -- we have flipped the switch on My Cintas and now let's see how many people we get, how many customers we get adopting. This is really -- we've opened it and this is going to grow -- just the product itself is going to continue to grow and add opportunity for us. So more and more customers will be added, but also more and more functionality will come with it into the future. And so to Todd's point, this is a journey, and it's an evolution, and we are in the very early stages of it. Operator : And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Paul Adler for closing remarks. Paul F. Adler: Okay, Ross. Thank you all for joining us this morning. We will issue our fourth quarter fiscal 2023 financial results in July, and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Good day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  I'll now turn the call over to Todd. Todd Schneider : Thank you, Jared. Fourth quarter total revenue grew 10.1% to $2.28 billion. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 10.3%. We are pleased with these fourth quarter results, where each of our businesses continue to grow and execute at a high level, especially coming off our highest growth quarter in fiscal '22.  Fourth quarter gross margin was $1.09 billion. Gross margin increased 210 basis points from 45.6% to 47.7%, an increase of 15.1% over the prior year. Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 of $470.8 million, increased 16.4% over the prior year. Operating margin increased 110 basis points to 20.6% from 19.5% in the prior year. Fourth quarter net income was $346.2 million, an increase of 17.6%.  Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter were $3.33, an increase of 18.5% over the prior year fourth quarter. These results conclude a fiscal year of significant accomplishments, including the following : Fiscal year '23 revenue was a record $8.82 billion, an increase of 12.2%. Organic growth was also 12.2% for the year. We saw double-digit organic growth for every quarter during fiscal '23.  We were once again named to the prestigious Fortune 500 for the sixth consecutive year. It is an honor to be recognized among the most successful and respected companies. Operating income grew 13.6% for the year. When you exclude both fiscal '22, $12.1 million gain on the sale of operating assets and a $30.2 million gain on an equity method investment transaction, operating income grew 16.7%. EPS grew 11.5% for the year, excluding the previously mentioned prior year gains, EPS grew 15.2%. We increased our quarterly per share dividend by 21.1%. We've increased our dividend every year since going public, which is 39 consecutive years. As part of our steadfast commitment to corporate responsibility, we issued our third environmental, social and governance, or ESG report. Each year, we continue to make the report more robust. Cintas was founded on a sustainable business model. Our corporate culture is based on doing what is right and challenging ourselves to improve. We're proud of these results and the efforts of our employees whom we call partners.  I'll now turn the call over to Mike, to provide details of our fourth quarter results. J. Michael Hansen : Thank you, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal '23 fourth quarter revenue was $2.28 billion compared to $2.07 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate, adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 10.3%. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 was $1.77 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 9.1%. As we've done in the past, I will share revenue mix of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment for the fourth quarter. Keep in mind, there can be small fluctuations in mix between quarters. Uniform Rental was 48%, dust [ph] was 18%, hygiene was 16%, shop towels were 4%, linen, which includes microfiber wipes, towels and aprons was 10%, and catalog revenue was 4%. These percentages are consistent with last year, which speaks to the robust demand across all of our products and services. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the fourth quarter was $249.8 million compared to $218.2 million last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 14.1%. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $261.5 million compared to $226.2 million last year. The fire business revenue was $173.5 million, and the organic revenue growth rate was 17.3% resulting in a strong finish to the year. The Uniform Direct Sale business revenue was $88 million, and the organic growth rate was 11.5%. This strong performance exceeded our expectations as robust demand continued for these products and services. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 was $1.09 billion, compared to $946.2 million last year, an increase of 15.1%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 47.7% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 compared to 45.6% last year, an increase of 210 basis points. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas and electricity were a tailwind, decreasing 65 basis points from last year. Strong volume growth from new customers and the penetration of existing customers with more products and services help generate great operating leverage. Gross margin percentage by business was 47.7% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 51% for First Aid and Safety Services, 47.9% for Fire Protection Services and 36% for Uniform Direct sale.  Fourth quarter SG&A was 27.1%, which was up 100 basis points from last year. We've continued to invest in selling resources and branding initiatives, and our insurance costs were higher. We are self-insured, which means our insurance costs can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Fourth quarter operating income was $470.8 million compared to $404.4 million last year. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 20.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 compared to 19.5% in last year's fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.4% compared to 22.8% last year. Net income for the fourth quarter was $346.2 million compared to $294.5 million last year. This year's fourth quarter diluted EPS was $3.33 compared to $2.81 last year. I'll now turn the call back over to Todd to provide his thoughts and our financial expectations for fiscal '24. Todd Schneider : Thank you, Mike. As we move into fiscal '24, we will celebrate our 40th anniversary of being a publicly traded company. Back then, we were excited about what laid ahead. Today, we are equally excited about the significant opportunities that the future holds. Our value proposition remains strong, and our prospects for continued profitable growth are great. Every business goods producing or services providing has a need for image, safety, cleanliness and compliance. We work with businesses to help them build a better workday. We provide the products and perform the services better, faster and more economically freeing businesses to concentrate on their core competency.  A year ago, I introduced three priorities : branding, ESG and technology to help drive our focus, continue to differentiate us in the marketplace and provide increased competitive advantages. I'm pleased with our progress in each of these key areas. Our branding efforts continue as more and more businesses have learned how we can help them get ready for the workday. We continue to make progress on our ESG goals and our sustainable solutions focus on reducing, reusing, recycling and repurposing our textiles. These solutions continue to resonate with our customers and prospects as we help them achieve their sustainability initiatives. I want to spend a minute speaking about technology, in particular, our digital transformation journey. We've been very successful thus far in using technology to drive efficiencies in our production facilities, efficiencies out on the routes with our trucks via our proprietary Smart Truck technology, and we are in the early innings of our My Cintas customer portal, which makes it easier for our customers to do business with us. As we look to the future, we're very excited to have great technology partners in SAP and Verizon, which are helping us to provide a better customer experience and improve efficiencies within our business. We are excited to announce today that we have an additional strategic technology partner with Google, leveraging their Google Cloud platform. As a result of these relationships, it positions us at the forefront of technology innovation.  We are still in the very early stages of our digital transformation journey, and we are excited about the impact it will have on our customers and our company in total. We are confident technology will be a competitive advantage for us now and well into the future. I will now provide our guidance for fiscal '24. Our fiscal year '24 -- for our fiscal year '24, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $9.35 billion to $9.5 billion, a total growth rate of 6.1% to 7.8%. We expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $13.85 to $14.35, a growth rate of 6.6% to 10.5%. Please note the following : fiscal year '24 interest expense is expected to be approximately $98 million compared to $109.5 million in fiscal year '23, predominantly as a result of lower variable rate debt. This may change as a result of future share buybacks or acquisition activity. Our fiscal '24 effective tax rate is expected to be 21.3% compared to a rate of 20.4% for fiscal '23. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '24 EPS guidance by about $0.16 and diluted EPS growth by about 120 basis points. Guidance does not include any future share buybacks or significant economic disruptions or downturns. And guidance includes the impact of having one more workday in fiscal '24 compared to fiscal '23. This extra workday comes in our fiscal third quarter. We're excited about next year and beyond. The future of Cintas remains bright.  I'll turn the call back over to Jared. Jared Mattingley : That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up as needed. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan Securities. Andrew Steinerman : Hi. I'd like to talk about net realized price as part of the organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter and into the guide. And I think you might need to remind me, I think there's no explicit gas surcharge that Cintas puts on, but obviously, gas prices are down year-over-year. And how does that factor into pricing? And just overall, how has Cintas done in terms of raising price to their B2B customers versus the input costs? Todd Schneider : Good morning, Andrew, thanks for the question. Yes, good question. We're -- from a pricing standpoint, as we have spoken about in past quarters, is our pricing has been certainly above historical during fiscal '23, as it needed to be because of the cost inputs. When we think about what that will look like moving forward in our '24 guide, we expect that pricing will return closer to historical and our cost inputs are in a similar spot, as you saw in the CPI report that came out yesterday and the PPI report that came out this morning. We are seeing inflation coming down. I think our team has done a pretty amazing job of managing input costs, both our operational team but our supply chain team which has really benefited us. So it's -- we do not rely upon pricing as the only lever to gain leverage to expand margin. We are committed to extracting out inefficiencies in our business, and you're seeing that. And you've seen that in fiscal '23. And our guide for fiscal '24 reflects incremental -- attractive incremental margins, and we're going to do it successfully, and we're going to expect that inefficiencies in our business to help us expand margins. J. Michael Hansen : Thank you, Andrew, I might just add two things. One, specifically, we do not have a fuel surcharge. And secondly, you made a comment about our price increases offsetting input costs and I think the best -- the way to think about that is margins in the fourth quarter were up 110 basis points. Margin for the fiscal '23 year were up 70 basis points and our guidance implies margin improvement throughout the range of guidance for next year. So, keep that in mind as we think about pricing versus input costs, et cetera, we're still raising margins, improving margins. Andrew Steinerman : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank Securities. Faiza Alwy : Yes. Hi, good morning. I wanted to talk about the type of economic or macro environment that you're embedding in your guide. I know you said that significant economic disruptions or downturn is not assumed, but give us a sense of what type of economic environment you're assuming? Todd Schneider : Faiza, thank you for the question. We're not guiding towards a significant economic disruption. Trying to predict economic indicators is certainly very challenging. But I can tell you what's going on, what we're seeing in our business, which is we haven't seen much change in our customer behavior.  Our sales productivity is very good. Our customer retention levels remain quite strong. And there is -- there's still really good interest in our products and our services. Know programmers are still going very well. And there's still the majority of the new accounts that we sell. So we like that very much. We like expanding the pie and those customers are seeing value in what we're providing. We also like our vertical strategy that -- the vertical sales strategy that has been working quite nicely for us. So I would say, reasonably so business as usual is what we would expect. We recognize there will be ups and downs in macro environments, but we're not guiding towards anything -- any economic downturn. Faiza Alwy : Great. Thank you. And then if I could just follow up on the -- you mentioned the Google partnership. Maybe give us a sense of where you see that partnership going over the next few years? What some of the benefits might be as you think about your digital transformation strategy? Todd Schneider : Certainly. Our relationship with Google gives us a better, faster, smarter, cheaper way to store our critical data. But we see it as it can do so much more, due in large part because of the relationship that Google has with SAP and the relationship we have with SAP and now Google. As you all know, we have had a very successful relationship with SAP for over a decade now. And we've spoken in the past that it is much more than just a customer vendor relationship. It's a strategic relationship.  So you combine that with just a couple of months ago, SAP and Google announced that they have an expanded partnership. And what that's going to do is it's going to allow our SAP data to be connected with the Google Cloud Data and analytics technology, which will give us access to their advanced AI and machine learning capabilities. So we're excited about that. It's going to -- we think we can benefit for many years to come as this type of relationship. But you asked Faiza for a few examples. So I'll give you a few to help give a little color around it. We see having these technologies connected, the opportunity to put in front of our sales organization instead of calling, I'll say, more blindly on who to try to sell our services to, we call it next best prospect for our sales team to have real technologies to push in front of them. Here's where you go spend your time. We think that's significant and can have an impact on our productivity and our retention and morale productivity, all those things. Next best product for the customer. So instead of just trying to figure that out, we can put that in front of our sales team to -- and our service team to make sure that they're talking to our customers about the next best product that would fit based upon other customer behaviors. We think certain customer service functions could be enhanced nicely over the coming years. There is -- we all use Google Maps, and we see an opportunity to leverage Google Maps to even further enhance our Smart Truck technology to make routing even more dynamic, which will save us time, saves us energy, saves us -- allows for more time in front of our customers instead of on the road. And then just one more, I would say is that, our service team, we're blessed to have a lot of customers. We want to make sure that they're spending -- they're in front of the right customers at the right time. And we see the potential to leverage that type of technology to point them in the right direction to make sure that they're focused on any at-risk customers and customers that we need to enhance the effort with them with the people in front of them. So hopefully, that gives you a little color around it. Again, this is not -- we don't see this as an event, we see this as a process and the coming years, we think it can be very impactful for our business and our customers. Faiza Alwy : Great. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it. Operator : Next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to turn down into the First Aid and Safety Services we saw some material acceleration in growth there. I was wondering if you can talk about what's driving that strength. And then as you think about '24 any puts and takes that you would call out? Or how do we think about that momentum going forward? Thanks. Todd Schneider : Thank you, Ashish. I'll start, and if Mike wants to chime in. The First Aid and Safety business is going quite well. We really like that business. We've -- we see significant opportunities in the future there. And we're getting leverage there, really growth -- the strong growth is really helping us get some real leverage but the mix of business is very attractive. We spoke about during the peaks of the pandemic now, there was more PPE sales and safety sales. And the mix is now back to what we really like, it's a cabinet sale that are repeat in nature and higher margin. So we really like the mix, but the growth in total is great.  And I would tell you that the value proposition is really resonating our customers are trying to make sure that they're reinvesting in their people. Health and wellness is a concept that is resonating very strongly in the marketplace, and we're leveraging that and benefiting from that. And on top of that, we're also -- we have inefficiencies in that business as well. So we're extracting out those inefficiencies. They're going to help us continue to expand our margins. But we like the position we're in, we like the tailwinds we have with the health and wellness, and we think the future is quite bright in that area. Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful color. I just wanted to drill down further on the vertical sales strategy. Obviously, you mentioned you're seeing some pretty good success on that front. I was wondering if you could drill down further on the key verticals. And then also on your health care initiative, how those are trending, but also any other verticals that you would call out? Thanks. Todd Schneider : Certainly. Our key verticals where we're focusing our time is health care, education and government. We've organized around those verticals. We have products and services that are attractive to them. Certain service functions dedicated to them. And as a result, we're really benefiting from it. And we very much think that they're smart verticals to invest in. And as a result, they're growing really attractively. And customer retention is good, new business is good. And we think that there's a real long opportunity here for us to continue to invest in these into the future. Certainly, the demographics of health care are quite attractive. But education and government are doing well in addition, and we're going to continue to invest in those areas. So it's paying dividends for us. Ashish Sabadra : That\u2019s very helpful color. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Manav Patnaik : Good. I think historically, you've talked about how almost two-thirds of that -- two-thirds of new sales come from those known programmers. I just wanted to update that and kind of tied to that. What is the competitive environment look like? Have there been any changes? Because your two public comps, obviously, there's a lot of changes going on at each of the organizations? Todd Schneider : Yes, Manav, you were -- I couldn't hear the first part, but I think I understand your question. I'll try to answer it. And if I don't, then please let me know. The know programmers are -- it's going quite well. And it has historically been a significant portion of what we sell, and it continues to be a significant portion of what we sell. And we have products and services that are attractive to them. We have a sales effort that is, I'd say, skilled at identifying and delivering the message to those folks. And I think it's important to understand that with know programmers, it's not always -- I would say rarely is it just all incremental new spend to them. Many, many cases, we are able to -- they're spending those dollars somewhere in many cases, with other vendors, maybe not a direct competitor, but they're spending money on compliance and image and safety and cleanliness, those types of things. And as a result, we're able to redirect those dollars to us, in many cases, save the money. So don't think of it all as, oh my gosh, is there an end to that because if the economy -- there's any stress in it that they're not going to be able to sell know programmers there, quite the opposite. We're -- we see a very, very long runway there. So that's attractive. As far as the competitive set, I mean, we operate in a very competitive industry, a very competitive environment. I would say I haven't seen any changes to the competitive landscape from that standpoint. So I'll leave it at that. Manav Patnaik : Okay. And then just one quick follow-up I had, I think I understand that the Google partnership the benefits it potentially brings with any sense of time line? Like when does this start happening, when you get the data on the cloud and then you start seeing some of these benefits? Todd Schneider : Well, it's certainly going to be a process. We just entered into our relationship with them recently. We've had meetings with them to talk about where we're going to go here. And as I mentioned, it's not an event. It's a process. But we see some low-hanging fruit, I guess is the best way to say it. But as we have gone down this path, more ideas are coming out. So we think we can benefit for years to come with this opportunity. And I won't go into too much detail just because we see some competitive advantages there. And so as a result, we'll keep those to ourselves. But we think the runway is long and attractive. Manav Patnaik : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Josh Chan with UBS. Joshua Chan : Hi, good morning, Todd, Mike and Jared, congrats on a strong quarter. My first question, when you are selling First Aid and Fire, basically those adjacent businesses, how much of that growth is selling to existing customers? And how much of it gets you kind of entirely new customers that don't run uniform from you? Todd Schneider : Yes. Josh, it's a good question. It's a mix. Cross-sell has been very helpful for us over the last number of years and will continue to be. But we love new customers. And the Fire and First Aid, there is some overlap, but not complete overlap. And so it allows us to get into speaking to customers about that. And the first time they may have done business with us at all. So -- and then we -- separately we have an enterprise sales organization that will call a customer or prospect.  And frankly, it doesn't really matter to us what they start with. It's whatever the customer is interested in. If a customer doesn't do any business with us and they want to start -- their interest is in Fire, wonderful, or if it's in First Aid, wonderful, or rental garments, then we go where the interest is and then we expand out that relationship from there. So we love the fact that there isn't complete overlap, and it gets us into new opportunities and then we cross-sell like crazy. Joshua Chan : Great. That makes sense. Thanks for the color. And I guess for my follow-up, if I look at your incremental margin, it's climbed pretty steadily through 2023. I assume if you got better alignment between price and cost. So how are you thinking about the cadence of incremental margins looking into 2024? J. Michael Hansen : Josh, our incremental margin for the total company in fiscal '23 was 26.8%, a little bit up from the previous year. And Josh, it's -- there can be ups and downs from quarter-to-quarter in the way that we invest or in the cost that we see. And so we don't necessarily try to predict one quarter at a time. We do certainly believe we can get incremental operating margins in that 20% to 30% range from quarter-to-quarter generally, but it's going to go up and down, again, based on what we are doing within the business, some initiatives that we may or may not roll out. So the bigger focus for us is on the full year, and our goal is to get those incremental attractive enough that it improves margins over the year. So I wouldn't call it linear at all, I wouldn't call it flat. It's going to be based on how we're managing the business. Joshua Chan : That\u2019s great. Thanks for the color and thanks for your time. Operator : Your next question comes from Justin Hauk with R.W. Baird. Justin Hauk : Good morning, everyone. I wanted to -- I guess, my first question, maybe a follow-up on Andrew's question, just on the implied revenue growth, the 7% in 2024. And maybe you can kind of pull out the puts and takes, but that's coming off of a 12% you just did here in '23, that was off of already a really strong 10%. 7% is more, I guess, kind of in line with kind of your long-term historical organic growth. And so -- maybe you can just give us the puts and takes. Is it all pricing that accounts for the delta because it sounds like your new business and retention and kind of existing sales are all still very strong? So I'm just trying to understand the moving pieces? Todd Schneider : Thanks for the question, Justin. I'll try to answer and see if Mike wants to expand upon it. So when you think about our growth, Q4 growth was around 10%, which is really nice growth, especially considering a strong comp of last year of 12.7%, which was our strongest growth of the year, that year.  So if you compare that 10% to the -- I'll call it the top end of our guide or in the mid-7s to higher 7s, you can think of that as really pricing returning back to closer to historical levels. And as I mentioned earlier, the reason that we see this as appropriate and is we're seeing an easing of inflation. And we saw that -- you can see that in the drop in the cost of energy that we've seen, the benefit we received in Q4. And as I mentioned earlier, also you saw it in the CPI report yesterday and the PPI report today. So -- and as you appropriately said, I mean, we're guiding towards a more historical type of growth volume growth is really good still. Pricing will return closer to historical appropriately so. But all that being said, we will still have -- we're guiding towards incremental margins and operating margin expansion. So pricing is a lever, but it's not our only lever available to us in order to expand margins. Justin Hauk : Okay. No, that's helpful. I mean that's I guess, kind of what you were implying, but I wanted to clarify that, that was kind of the magnitude of the change. I guess the second question, just on the insurance cost increase, and maybe SG&A as a percentage of revenue in general, how much of an impact was that in the quarter?  And then is that kind of a run rate headwind that you'll face next year? And the reason why I ask is, obviously, you're implying margin expansion here, but your SG&A as a percentage of revenue is still pretty low versus kind of pre-COVID levels. And so just trying to understand how much structural SG&A leverage gain you have here versus returning to more of a normalized level? J. Michael Hansen : Justin, because we are self-insured, those claims can -- they can kind of move up and down throughout the year. There's nothing that we would say is structural related to that. It's just a product of being self-insured. We ended the year at 26.9% in SG&A, that is, gosh, a couple of 100 basis points maybe lower than pre-COVID in the last few years, and you've heard us speak about this.  Look, we've worked hard to get it to that level, and we don't want to get back to historical levels. So our expectation is we're going to continue to find ways to better leverage SG&A, particularly G&A to make sure that it contributes to our margin expansion into the future. So we're going to continue to work hard to look for opportunities to bring it down and do not expect it to return to those higher 20 places that we were in pre-COVID. Justin Hauk : Great. Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : And we'll hear next from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. You mentioned there hasn't been much change in customer behaviors based on what you're seeing. Can you elaborate on how customer budgets, sales cycles in the sales pipeline are evolving with the current environment? Todd Schneider : Good morning, George. It's a pretty -- the environment hasn't changed significantly. The health of customers is varies based upon geographic, what type of business they're in, small, medium, large, those types of things. But generally speaking, the sales process and has not elongated the sales pipe looks very good. We like the spot we're in. And we have invested appropriately. We're in the right -- we've got the right products and services. We've got the right focus on our customers, and we think that we're well positioned for the future. And we certainly are trying to make sure that we're planning for the long term. And we're -- as I mentioned earlier, not trying to be an economic forecasting business, but we are making sure that we're watching our business very closely and hoping for clear sailing ahead with the economy. That being said, we will find a way to be successful as we have in the past. George Tong : Got it. That's helpful. And then I wanted to drill down further into your healthcare vertical, which you touched on earlier, COVID certainly provided a notable lift to the health care business. Can you talk a little bit about how quickly the health care business is growing, what new business trends there look like and what mix of revenue we currently represent? Todd Schneider : Certainly, George. The healthcare business has been strong for us for a number of years. And is large part not just having a sales focus, but organizing around those customers, products, services, our service organization. So it's more than just sales. It is making sure that we look at it as a business. And it's growing -- it's accretive to our growth rates. We see very long runway there. As I mentioned earlier, the demographics are really attractive. But the pipeline of sales growth looks robust. And that's because of years of investment in making sure we're really well positioned, and we see that continuing. George Tong : Got it. And just the mix of revenue? J. Michael Hansen : I don't have that in front of us, George, right now. In the past, it's been about 7%. And it's -- I'd say that it's growing faster than average. George Tong : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Tim Mulrooney : Yes. Good morning. On the First Aid business, specifically, pre-pandemic operating margins were closer to 15%. They went down several 100 basis points. I know from the sell through a lower-margin PP&E in '21 and '22. But now it looks like you're sitting at 19%. I mean that's a big jump from pre-pandemic levels. Would you expect, I guess, Mike or Todd a little bit of a give back at some point? Or do you expect to keep and build on those margin gains that you've made this year? Todd Schneider : Yes, Tim, we do not expect to give back, we expect to maintain and build on those improvements. And we're leveraging certainly the total growth, the benefits of health and wellness being important to people in the marketplace. The mix of business being attractive and we've fundamentally focused on extracting out inefficiencies in the business. So -- and we're not giving those back. So yes, we see the future is bright for that business. Tim Mulrooney : Yes. Okay. It was more than just sales mix. It sounds like you did some structural things. J. Michael Hansen : Yeah. Tim, we talk a lot about the mix certainly returning, and that's being -- that's a big part of it. But as Todd mentioned, our first aid safety partners have a lot of things going on in terms of business improvement opportunities from sourcing better, to routing better, to sales productivity improving, to penetration opportunities. There's a lot going on in that business.  And we've attributed a lot, you're correct, to the revenue mix, and that has been important in terms of the height of the pandemic to today. But there's also a lot that's going on in the business that is working towards structural improvements in the business that create long-term efficiencies and you're seeing that. And that's why we don't expect to give it back. There's nothing that we are underspending or underinvesting in to get these margins. These are real business improvements that are sustainable. And that's what we love about the business. It has been growing nicely, it's resonating with our prospects and customers. And it's pretty exciting to think about that business in our fiscal '24 topping $1 billion for the first time. So we do love the business, and there's a lot of good work going on there. Tim Mulrooney : That is exciting, and I appreciate the extra color there. Mike, that's very clear. If I could just shift gears really quickly. One of your competitors recently commented that they saw customer retention rates come down a little bit recently. But it was kind of more of a normalization, okay, like following a boost over the last several years, when things were good. Now that kind of back towards historical rates. I'm curious and some investors are curious if you guys saw something similar to any material degree, did you see retention rates kind of jump up a little bit in fiscal '22 and '23? And have you seen that pull back or normalize, so to speak, more recently? Thank you. Todd Schneider : Great question, Tim. So, over the past few years, we've seen a nice improvement to our customer retention levels through the pandemic. We think that we handle that really strategically, intelligently and thought about the long term. And we saw our customer satisfaction scores go up at that same time. And we've continued to see those same levels of customer satisfaction and retention levels.  So no, we have not seen a change from that standpoint. And we're always working on improving our business and making sure that we are super focused on making sure we're taking great care of our customers and staying attentive to their needs, is a big part of what makes us successful. So we've not seen a change, and we're focused on making sure that doesn't happen. Tim Mulrooney : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We'll hear next from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Good morning. I wanted to ask your expectations for ad stops as we go into fiscal '24. It seems as though companies are starting to slow down their hiring. And I'm wondering what type of impact that's included in the guidance or what you're anticipating? Todd Schneider : Kartik, we have not seen a change to our ad stops metrics, and we are expecting that, that will continue. We're -- part of it is because of the diversity of our customer base, not just good producing services providing and the broadness of our customer base. We're not dependent upon any one particular area and we expect to grow in multiples of GDP. And all that being said, we expect that and stops metrics will continue on its path. Kartik Mehta : Perfect. And then Mike, you might have said this, so I apologize if you already talked about this. But just the impact from energy costs in FY '24 versus FY '23, what you've included or anticipated. J. Michael Hansen : So let me -- I'll give you a couple of numbers. Fourth quarter total energy for the total company was 1.8% for the fourth quarter. For the year, that was 2.2%. So for the year -- this year -- fiscal '23 compared to '22, it was down 10 basis points. So it's roughly flattish. As we think about '24, look, the prices at the pump spiked in June of last year. And so our first quarter numbers of last year were fairly high. And so we may get a little bit of a tailwind in Q1 and then our expectation is we'll turn roughly flattish. Kartik Mehta : Okay. Thank you very much. I really appreciate it. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Seth Weber with Wells Fargo. Seth Weber : Good morning. I wanted to just circle back to the revenue guidance point again for a second. I'm just -- it sounds like First Aid Safety and the Fire business both have very strong momentum, so I'm just trying to understand the construct of the revenue guide, whether you think all three segments will be in that kind of 6% to 8% range or will there be some above and some below to kind of put out to that 6% to 8% range? Because it seems like there's still a lot of momentum in the First Aid Safety and Fire business. Todd Schneider : Well, Seth, good morning. We like the momentum in all of our businesses. So will there be some above, some below? Yes. But it's -- but generally speaking, we see in the mid-to-high single digits would be probably where you can think of it. And it's -- and as I mentioned earlier, the -- we're up against comps that are significant, partly because of pricing being above historical in the past, well above historical, now it being closer to historical. Seth Weber : Okay. Maybe, Mike, my follow-up question just on CapEx. It's kind of pushing up towards that 4%ish number again. Is that the right way to think about it for fiscal '24? And then can you just give us any color on what that -- whether that's brick-and-mortar or whether just where that spending might be going from a capacity perspective or whatnot? J. Michael Hansen : Sure. Yes, we would expect 3.5% to 4% of revenue. Look, when we've had a really good couple of years of volume growth, we have capacity needs in certain places. Capacity is local in our business, but we have capacity needs. And we want to continue to invest for growth. And so there will be everything from added washers and dryers and specific wash alleys to some of a few bricks and mortar new buildings and other investments in the business that allow us to continue to have the capacity we need to grow. So it is kind of back to that historical 3.5% to 4% range. That would be our expectation. Seth Weber : Got it. I appreciate guys. Thank you very much. Operator : And we'll move next to Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Heather Balsky : Hi, thank you for taking my question. I know you've got a question earlier about sort of the trend in sales and the difference is related to pricing. I'm curious, focusing specifically on the uniforms business. You've been growing organically 9% to -- and 11% the last few quarters. If presumably were well past the COVID recovery period. I'm just curious what's enabled you to drive that outperformance versus kind of pre-COVID levels? And if you think that sustainable going forward? Todd Schneider : Good morning, Heather. So yes, our Uniform Rental business is performing quite well. We've -- we think we have invested appropriately in the sales organization. We really like where we're going there. We like the productivity levels. They've continued to go up. And there's plenty of inputs to productivity and it's whether it's products that we launch, services that we launch, the retention levels of our people, the leadership of the organization to make sure that we're driving items that make them more successful.  So no, it's going well, and our service organization is doing an outstanding job with customer retention, making sure, as I mentioned earlier, our customer satisfaction scores are near all-time highs. And as a result of that, our lost business, our customer retention, the appropriate way to say it. Our customer retention is really attractive. So our new is up and our customer retention is improved over pre-COVID levels. So those are big for us and having a really positive impact on the business. Heather Balsky : Great. Thank you. That's really helpful. And I feel like I have to ask an AI question here. You guys talked about being early in your digital transformation journey. Are you guys looking at any investments on the AI side in terms of efficiencies and sort of behind the scenes type benefit? I'm just curious. Thanks. Todd Schneider : Yes, Heather, we're certainly investigating and investing in opportunities. And we think we're with the right partners. When you think about Verizon, SAP and Google, having those three as the -- our technology -- our strategic technology partners, we think we're with the right folks. And we don't just have a customer vendor relationship with them, we have a strategic relationship with them, and they're helping us -- they are and will help us to leverage those opportunities in the marketplace.  So I can't lay out specifics for you, but I'll just tell you this, we're -- we see the opportunity to invest in that area, and we are doing so appropriately because we think it will pay big dividends. That being said, it will be -- we'll be speaking about this for many, many years to come because we think the benefit has a real -- has a lot of legs to it. Heather Balsky : That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. Guys, kind of a cautionary question. It sounds like things are going really well and recent economic indicators feel pretty good, but just curious to hear what the plan is if -- as your guidance expects no softness in the economy, how are you looking at what levers would you pull on the efficiency side? What should give us assurance you'll be in good shape if you're not able to get some of the leverage you've been getting on the top line? Thanks. Todd Schneider : Scott, let me make sure I understand. You're saying if we can't get to leverage or if the economic environment changes? Scott Schneeberger : If the economic environment dips in below kind of status quo and really deteriorate, just curious what kind of leverage you guys would pull to maintain the financial sense? Todd Schneider : Yes. Certainly. Good question. I -- we have a very tenured, very experienced leadership team, management team that has been through the cycles. It seems like you name it, we've been through it, and we expect to be successful in all environments. Now -- so your -- the question is a tough one to answer because the economic downturn, how deep is it? How long is it? How broad? And so trying to understand that is challenging. But we expect to be successful in all economic environments.  If you're talking about a massive downturn in '08, '09, that might be different. But we're ready. We know how to do this. We have demonstrated our ability to be successful in and all these different types of economic environments. We have grown our sales and profits in 52 -- in the last 54 years. And my expectation is we will absolutely do so and we will find and fight and a way to be successful in whatever economic environment. So plenty of levers available to us. And we think we've got the right team in place to manage that. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. I appreciate that. And then for the follow-up, it's a bit of a two-parter and one to your housekeeping. I was just curious, your -- thanks for answering on Seth's question on CapEx, what that will look like, just other uses of capital as we head into fiscal '24, thoughts on buybacks, thoughts on M&A, any other cleanup on the balance sheet you were considering? And then that second part would just be, if you could remind us what a one day -- one extra workday quantitative impact is that in fiscal '24 versus '23? J. Michael Hansen : Sure. From a capital allocation, I'll start with our expectation is that cash flow is going to continue to be very good in fiscal '24. And secondly, our balance sheet is in great shape. We -- as of May 31, we have no variable debt. And so we can do a lot of things with great cash flow and a great balance sheet. We would love to use that on M&A if the opportunities come along, and we'll be as aggressive as we can be in terms of looking for them and making sure that they come at the right value, but we love that opportunity. Buyback is another great opportunity, again, with good cash flow and a great balance sheet, we can put that cash to work, and we certainly could do it in the form of a buyback. So, look, our capital allocation philosophy and strategy hasn't changed. And with -- again, with a healthy balance sheet and a healthy cash flow, we can do some good things with that as we look forward to fiscal '24. Your second question of the one workday for a fiscal year. In this case, it would be about a 40 basis point benefit to growth -- sales growth. And think about it as about a 12 basis point benefit on bottom line on operating margin. Scott Schneeberger : Great, thanks. Appreciate all the color. Operator : Your next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicolas. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to just ask a little bit more on kind of the hiring environment at your clients. You said you're not expecting it to change. It's been a very strong hiring environment for the last several years since that kind of initial dip in COVID. Is there a way that you think about it in your mind in terms of the strong hiring environment and just kind of clients adding personnel driving some of that revenue growth, particularly in the Rental Uniforms division? Or do you think it's really a lot more of the company's own efforts in terms of cross-selling, finding new customers and pricing? Then I have a follow-up. Todd Schneider : Good question, Shlomo. We love it when our customers are hiring more employees and it certainly allows you to swim a little bit downstream then. But we've got to find ways to add value to customers even when they're in the more flattish type environment. That being said, there is still almost 10 million job openings. So that's very encouraging.  We'd love to see those jobs filled. But we are -- we're going to find a way to be successful whether our customers are hiring at rapid rates or at much lower rates, we're going to find a way to be successful. And that is impacted by our ability to -- we would call it cross-sell, bring more value to the customers in other products and services that they may have with maybe a new business unit, but maybe within that business unit just selling more items. So there's a lot of inputs to that and how we categorize it. But we're -- we like the spot that we're in. And we think the products and services and the value proposition that we're providing is resonating with people. And would certainly love the economic to continue or even improve. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Great. And then just on a follow-up. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the margin just on a sequential basis of looking at the First Aid and Safety. And then kind of the other division, you had a sequential decline despite revenue going up in the Rental Uniforms you have continuing to go up? Or was there something particular on the insurance side that hit the other divisions? Or is there some particular investments that are going on right now? Just if you can give a little bit of a sequential color on what's going on with the operating margins? J. Michael Hansen : Sure, Shlomo. Look, the First Aid margin was at 18.8% in Q4, still a really healthy place to be. And nothing noteworthy other than growth is -- organic growth still is very good, gross margin is still very good, and we continue to invest for the future. So nothing noteworthy there. From the all other perspective, the Fire operating margin in Q4 was slightly over 20 and so that's a great place for us in that business. The direct sale business was 3.5%. So quite a bit lower. And that business can move up and down and have a little bit more volatility than the other businesses just because of the nature of it. We still love the business. It grew nicely, but mix can have an outsized effect on that operating margin and it sort of did in the fourth quarter. As we move forward, from a First Aid perspective, we still expect the really positive margins that we've seen as we've discussed a few minutes ago. And we still expect Fire to continue to perform very, very well like it has in fiscal '23. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to follow up on First Aid growth. You talked about the Cabinet business contributing it again, which is great. I was hoping you could talk about, is that sort of an industry penetration is growing? Or is it the product set relatively new. I know you're investing in it during COVID. Have you been sort of incentivizing your sales force to sell more cabinets? And are you taking share? Just wanted to get a sense on how long the sort of 20% growth in cabinets can continue and if there are any other factors you'd call out as well? Thanks. Todd Schneider : Thank you, Toni. We -- the answer is yes. All the above is what we're doing. We see a long runway in the First Aid business. We're -- the vast majority of what we sell are people that are do-it-yourself. There's -- as you think about, there's 16 million businesses in North America, there is a significant opportunity to sell our First Aid cabinet services, but our other services as well, whether they be AEDs, wash stations, those types of items that really have value to customers. And that health, safety, compliance tailwind, we don't see that changing. People are investing in their organizations, and we see that as a tailwind for many years to come and the market is really, really big. So that's where we're -- we love the growth that we're seeing in that business, and we're continuing to invest appropriately to make sure that it continues. Toni Kaplan : Terrific. And this should be a short one, but hoping you could talk about maybe the sensitivity of the business from inflation. So presumably, your costs come down as if inflation comes down, so how should we be thinking about maybe like the impact to margin for each point inflation comes down or however you want to frame the sensitivity there? Thanks. J. Michael Hansen : Toni, that's a really difficult thing to try to say one point of inflation equals x points of margin. That's pretty difficult to do. But I'd maybe say this. When you think about our cost structure, we've got a really nice mix of cost types, if you will. So we certainly have things like labor that are impacted by inflationary pressures. And we work very, very hard on that over the course of the last five years, I would say. And we're in a good spot. But then we also have this large part of our cost structure that is amortizing. And it allows us to effectively see any inflationary impacts coming if they are coming and plan for them accordingly. And so we may plan for that in terms of our pricing approach, we may plan for that in terms of other initiatives. But the point is, because we're amortizing those costs, it takes a while for inflation to get to us, and during that period of time, we can plan and we can anticipate better. While we're on that bucket, I would say our global supply chain really does a nice job of not being single sourced. And so when there are some inflationary pressures in various parts of the world or in our supply chain, because we're not single source, we have the ability to move volume a little bit in flex, we have choices. And that's important for us. And it has been important for us over the course of the last two years in the high inflationary environment. And then the third bucket that I would throw out is sort of that infrastructure. We've got a large infrastructure, 400-plus locations around the country. And when we are growing really nicely, we're leveraging it very, very well, and we've done that over the course of the last few years. And so Toni, we're not a product company that is dramatically affected by today's inflation. And you hear us talk about pricing is just one lever that we have to get margin improvement.  And that's because of, number one, we've got this sort of diverse cost structure. And number two, we've got a lot of initiatives and things that we're working on. And it gives us choices. And that's the -- that's really the key for us in terms of fighting inflation. So hopefully, that answers the question. It's not an easy metric for us because of the cost structure that we have and the initiatives that we have, and it also depends on where the inflation comes from. Toni Kaplan : Super. Thanks a lot. Operator : And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Mattingley for any additional or closing remarks. Jared Mattingley : Thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our first quarter fiscal '24 financial results in September. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jared Mattingley, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Jared Mattingley : Thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our fiscal 2024 first quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts.  The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'll now turn the call over to Todd. Todd Schneider : Thank you, Jared. We are pleased with our start to fiscal year 2024. First quarter total revenue grew 8.1% to $2.34 billion. Each of our businesses continue to execute at a high level. The benefits of our strong volume growth and revenue flow through to our bottom line. Operating income margin increased 110 basis points to an all-time high of 21.4%, and diluted EPS grew 9.1% to $3.70.  I thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders and each other. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the first quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.83 billion compared to $1.7 billion last year. Their organic revenue growth rate was 7.6%. While price increases moved near historical levels, revenue growth continues to be driven mostly from increased volume. Our sales force continues to add new customers and penetrate and cross-sell our existing customer base. Businesses prioritize all we provide, including image, safety, cleanliness and compliance. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the first quarter was $260.7 million compared to $234.2 million last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 11%. Our value proposition continues to resonate in our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment. Health and safety of employees remains top of mind.  We provide businesses with access to quick and effective products and services that promote health and well-being in the workplace. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $254.8 million compared to $234.5 million last year.  The Fire business revenue was $174.3 million, and their organic revenue growth rate was 14.2%. The Uniform Direct Sale business revenue was $80.5 million which was down 2.7% organically compared to last year. Now before I turn the call over to Mike to provide details of our first quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $9.35 billion to $9.5 billion to a range of $9.4 billion to $9.52 billion, a total growth rate of 6.6% to 8%. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $13.85 to $14.35 to a range of $14 to $14.45, a growth rate of 7.8% to 11.2%. Mike? Michael Hansen : Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2024 first quarter revenue was $2.34 billion compared to $2.17 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate, adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 8.1%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.14 billion compared to $1.03 billion last year, an increase of 11%.  Gross margin as a percent of revenue was an all-time high of 48.7% for the first quarter of fiscal '24, compared to 47.5% last year, an increase of 120 basis points. Strong volume growth and continued operational efficiencies helped generate this record gross margin. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas and electricity were a tailwind, decreasing 50 basis points from last year. Please keep in mind that some of the energy benefit is the result of efficiencies we've created with our proprietary SmartTruck technology. Certainly, we've also seen a benefit from a drop in prices at the pump compared to a year ago. Gross margin percentage by business was 48.1% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 55.9% for First Aid and Safety Services, 49% for Fire Protection Services and 38.7% for Uniform Direct Sale. Operating income of $500.6 million compared to $440.1 million last year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue was 21.4% in the first quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 20.3% in last year's first quarter, an increase of 110 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 19.2% compared to 14.8% last year.  The tax rates in both quarters were impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. Net income for the first quarter was $385.1 million compared to $351.7 million last year. This year's first quarter diluted EPS of $3.70 compared to $3.39 last year, an increase of 9.1%.  Cash flow remains strong. Net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter grew 13% over the prior year. On September 15, we paid shareholders $138.3 million in quarterly dividends, an increase of 17.8% from the amount paid the previous September. Todd provided our annual financial guidance. Related to the guidance, please note the following : fiscal '24 interest expense is expected to be $98 million compared to $109.5 million in fiscal '23, predominantly as a result of lower variable rate debt; our fiscal '24 effective tax rate is expected to be 21.3%. This compares to a rate of 20.4% in fiscal '23. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '24 EPS guidance by about $0.16 and diluted EPS growth by about 120 basis points. Our financial guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks. Guidance includes the impact of having one more workday in fiscal '24 compared to fiscal '23. This extra workday comes in our fiscal third quarter. Jared? Jared Mattingley : That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow up if needed. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy : I wanted to see if you could provide a bit more color on the new business environment. And if you've noticed any change in terms of the macro environment. Certainly, you guys are talking to your customers every day. So just a bit more perspective around what you're seeing out there in the marketplace. Todd Schneider : Great. Yes, our new business pipeline is quite good. We love the state of our sales organization, the focus that they have, the scope. And so new business is quite good, and that's a big driver of our growth that you're seeing and we see that continuing. As far as macro environment, it is -- we haven't seen any real change in our customers' behavior, I would say, since we reported last.  So it's pretty consistent with what we have seen over the past few quarters. And we are watching it very, very closely and monitoring it as we move forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Manav Patnaik : I just wanted to see if you could give us a little more color, I think, in terms of the pricing strategy and then also the strong volume growth. So I think you said pricing is back to historical levels. So I'm guessing that's down in that low single-digit camp versus almost every other company talking about still, I guess, pricing higher than above and average. So it just maybe the first question is just how do we think about your pricing strategy here? Todd Schneider : Yes, it is certainly closer to historical levels, and we like that. That's, we think, appropriate based upon our cost inputs. But we're very proud of the fact that we're growing our business attractively, and we think we can continue this based upon new business being robust and our customer retention levels, being very good as well.  And we're seeing that in our customer satisfaction scores as well. And then the status of our customers is -- they're continuing on in the operating environment as they have in the past. So we like where we're positioned. We like the momentum in our business, and we like how we're growing it as well, and we think it's -- it bodes well for the future. Michael Hansen : Manav, I might just add -- Manav, I might just add to that, you asked about our pricing strategy. And as we've talked in the past, our goal is operating margin improvement, right? And pricing can be a lever within that, but we have other levers. It's not the only way for us to improve margins. And so as we think about the operating margin strategy of increasing, we've got a lot of good things going on. And this is a great quarter that shows where pricing is sort of returning back to that historical level. We still increased margins quite nicely even to record levels. And again, it's just that pricing is a part of that strategy. Manav Patnaik : Yes, that make sense. That's quite impressive. And then maybe just on the strong volume growth. Could you just help provide some color on how much of that is new business, cross-selling, maybe share gains? Any color around that? Todd Schneider : Yes. Good question, Manav. I mean, it's everything. As I mentioned, our new is quite good. Our retention levels, we're very happy with, and we're cross-selling. And we've -- we're continuing to make good progress there. We're never satisfied. But our value proposition is resonating with our customers, and we're trying to make it easier to do business with us through various technologies. And I think it's showing up in our results, and we're again bullish. Operator : And our next question comes from Josh Chan from UBS. Joshua Chan : I guess could I ask about inflation and what you're seeing across your different cost buckets, labor, energy, material? And how you expect that to kind of transpire over the coming quarters as well? Todd Schneider : Yes, I'll start, and Mike wants to chime in as well. Yes, so what we're seeing from an input cost standpoint, labor is still higher than historical. But to Mike's point earlier, we're finding ways to improve operating margin in that environment still. And part of it is because productivity is quite attractive.  And we're trying to position our employee partners so that they can be more successful in the marketplace, which is good for them and it's good for ourselves. And obviously, with that retention levels of our employee partners being much back -- very close to historical levels. That's good for our customers as well.  Other input costs, you saw where energy was down year over prior. That is really a Q1 subject because if you recall last year, the price at the pump was very high. And so we got a little bit of a tailwind there. But we think that will be pretty muted through the balance of the fiscal year.  And then last, material costs. Our global supply chain team is doing one heck of a job in trying to make sure that we're well positioned to have very competitive prices and access to all that product. And we've spoken in the past about how a very small percentage of our products are single sourced. So that positions us well as far as having access to product, but also being giving them at very competitive rates. Joshua Chan : And I guess for my follow-up, could you talk about what your CapEx expectations are this year and kind of the types of projects that you're investing in? Michael Hansen : Sure. We did see a little bit of an increase in CapEx in Q1. We are -- as we've talked, we are in the midst of implementing SAP for our Fire Protection business and that adds a little bit of CapEx. In the first quarter, we also saw -- over the last couple of years, supply chains, our vendors have had some disruption in their ability to deliver trucks being the best example.  And in the first quarter, we saw a little bit of a catch-up in terms of us receiving more of those trucks. And so we saw a bit of an increase there too in the first quarter. I expect for the year that we're going to likely be right around 4%. Longer term, we still believe 3.5% to 4%. But because of SAP and sort of that catch-up might be a little closer to 4% this year. Operator : And our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Heather Balsky : I was hoping, first, you could talk about your exposure to the auto sector and any exposure you may have to, I guess, some of the current disruption? And then two, if you could talk about through the end markets, are there any areas where just in this macro, you're seeing softness and areas where you're seeing strength would be great? Todd Schneider : Heather. Yes, we're certainly watching what's going on with the auto worker strike, but it is not affecting us in any material way whatsoever. We have a very broad-based customer base. And as a result of that, it's not affecting us to any material degree whatsoever.  And keeping in mind that we have no one customer that's greater than 1% of our revenue and no even sector that's greater than 10% for 3-digit NAICS codes. So that helps us and insulates us a bit from all that. As far as the macro environment, it really -- it varies based upon the sector, geography, whether they're goods producing or services providing. But the labor market is a little easier, but still not easy. And you see that through the -- what we've -- what we're reading with the job openings, still 9.5 million job openings. And that affects our customer base from a standpoint of them trying to attract and retain people. We would love to see those jobs filled because we think that would be really good for our customers and for the economy in general. Operator : And our next question comes from Justin Hauke from RW Baird. Justin Hauke : I wanted to ask about the First Aid margins because it kind of sustainably been higher than they have been historically and really more comparable to the Uniform Rental and the Facility Services segment. And I guess the question is, I mean, for years, that was kind of a scale business where you were building it out and it had lower margins. Are you at the point now where like that business has reached a point where it has very comparable margin sustainably to the Uniform Rental business? Todd Schneider : Yes, we really like the First Aid business. I mean it's -- that it resonates with our customer base. They -- a strong value proposition is helping our revenue growth. The mix has returned closer to historical with First Aid and Safety. And Justin, just like our other businesses, we're using various technologies to extract inefficiencies out of our business.  And there's certainly no exception to that. I mentioned that our global supply chain team has done -- doing a great job in sourcing product, and we're benefiting from sourcing there. But yes, we see -- certainly, there is -- running a business is not linear. But that being said, we certainly think that gross margins in excess of 50 are sustainable in that business. Justin Hauke : Okay. Great. And then I guess the last one is kind of more procedural, I guess. But you did -- it looks like on the cash flow about $56 million spending on acquisitions in the quarter, which is a little bit higher than what you guys typically do. Do you have any comments on kind of where that was, where we should see the revenue flow from it? Todd Schneider : Well, I'll start, and Mike can chime in. The -- Justin, as you know, we love leveraging our balance sheet for M&A. And we think it's a great use of cash, and we're very happy with the fact that we were able to deploy some of the cash to leverage that opportunity. And we are acquisitive in all 3 of our operating segments that are route-based. And we made acquisitions in all 3, so -- in Q1. So we're pleased with that, and we think that will -- is a great opportunity for us to bring those customers into the fold, those partners, those employee partners into the fold and provide more value and cross-sell to those customers that are now part of Cintas. Operator : And our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. George Tong : In the past, you've talked about strong demand from the health care, education and government verticals in driving Uniform Rental's growth. Can you discuss the latest trends you're seeing in these end markets and what's fueling the growth? Todd Schneider : Yes, those are 3 great verticals for us. I mean, they're 3 great segments of the North American economy. And so, yes, we're still seeing outsized growth in those markets. And as we've chatted about in the past, it's more than just a sales effort. We've organized around them. We've got products for them. We've got technologies for them.  And that is resonating with that customer base. So we think we've chosen them quite well, and there's plenty of runway in all of them. So we're, again, quite bullish on the future of those segments. George Tong : Got it. And then with respect to margins, your gross margins expanded 60 bps year-over-year in your Uniform segment. Most of that appears to be driven by lower energy costs. Can you discuss puts and takes around Uniform gross margins in the quarter and opportunities for additional margin expansion over the remainder of this year that comes above and beyond tailwinds you're seeing from lower energy costs? Todd Schneider : Yes. George, we're -- the nature of the math around our businesses, the Rental business is obviously a large percentage of it. And we're guiding towards margin expansion for the year. And we do not see energy being a tailwind for the balance of the year.  So we expect margin expansion based upon certainly leverage on revenue growth, that's going to be helpful. But we're extracting those inefficiencies out of our business. And as Mike mentioned earlier, we're proud of the fact that pricing is returning back to historical levels, but we're still able to grow operating margin -- gross margin and operating margin at very attractive levels and to levels that are all-time highs. So that's part of our plan. And our team is actually treating at a very high level, and we expect that, that will continue. Michael Hansen : George, I might just reiterate what I mentioned in the prepared remarks that keeping in mind that the energy benefit that we are getting is partly because we are working really hard at things like our SmartTruck initiative. So in other words, as we continue to grow really nicely with volumes, we don't need to add as many routes and trucks as we have in the past, and that creates then better fuel efficiency, if you will, throughout our network. And so that's a -- it is a proactive initiative to get energy down. And one of those proactive ways is through that SmartTruck technology. Todd Schneider : And Mike, I might add that when we extract those inefficiencies out, that's better for our customers because we're able to spend more time in front of them instead of on the road. It's certainly better for our partners, our employee partners because it makes them that much more productive, and that's good for them and our organization. And it's really good for the environment. So we think -- let's say there's a lot of boxes checked there, and we've worked hard on that technology over the years, and it's showing up. And it's benefiting not just the P&L in a more simplistic fashion, but in many ways. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Samuel Kusswurm : This is Sam Kusswurm on for Tim. I guess I want to start with another health care question here. But as it relates to your health care clients, you've talked a lot about the opportunity here, especially as more no programmers convert. But I guess I'd like to know for those health care operators who already use a service partner, what do you think your penetration rate is? And how might that compare to some of your other customer verticals? Todd Schneider : Sam, that's a good question. I don't have that in front of me. But we know this. We're in the early innings with health care. And we're coming up with more products and services that they find attractive. And that's part of our culture. We will enter into a business. But then we get out from behind our desk and we go spend time with our customers. And when we find that we find the answers to what they are most interested in by speaking to them, and our customers and our employee partners. And we're hearing from them on various areas where we can help them, and we're taking action there. So again, a very long runway in that vertical, and that's again part of our culture and will be part of how we go to market moving forward. Samuel Kusswurm : Got you. Appreciate it. Maybe just another quick one on the margins. I see SG&A as a percentage of sales picked up again in the quarter compared to last year. I guess I'm wondering if there was any variable costs like your insurance expenses? Or if it was mainly some of the selling and branding investments you've talked about previously? Maybe you could just help break that out for us a little more. Michael Hansen : Nothing unusual in the quarter. We did see the -- we talked in the fourth quarter about some claims getting higher, but not structural. We saw those come back down to something more normal. But as it relates to the quarter, just some puts and takes, nothing of any significance. Our goal is to continue to leverage particularly the G&A piece of that, and we're going to continue to work at that. Operator : And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan Securities. Andrew Steinerman : I wanted to talk to you about incremental margins, which were super strong in the quarter and last quarter on a year-over-year basis. I surely know, Cintas historically has targeted 20% to 30% as a range for incremental margins. But kind of given where we are right now, it definitely feels like that kind of low end of the range, the 20%, might not be as appropriate. And so my question is, has your medium-term range for incremental margins been creeping up? Todd Schneider : Yes. 20% to 30% is our target. We -- Q1 was a very attractive incremental margins. And there's always puts and takes in every quarter as I mentioned. Running a business is not linear. But we will expect that we will be in that 20% to 30% range. I certainly like higher in the range than lower. And we are -- and I think our guide speaks to where attractive margin improvement for the year as well. Operator : And our next question comes from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo. Seth Weber : I wanted to ask just about the small tick down in Uniform Direct Sales organic growth here in the quarter. It's the first, I think, decline that we've seen there in a while. I know the comp was hard. Is there anything else that you'd call out there for that business? Todd Schneider : Certainly, what we have seen outstanding performance from that business over the past really 2 years. And -- but it is -- as we've spoken about in the past, the Uniform Direct Sale business tends to be a little bit lumpier based upon rollouts of large programs, whether it's hospitality or a Fortune 1000-type customer. So nothing more than that. We still are bullish on the future of that business and for the year and moving forward. Seth Weber : Do you think, Todd, do you think that business could be up for the year? Or do you think that's kind of flattish or down? Todd Schneider : I would suspect -- well, we expect all of our businesses to grow. So I would suspect that we would see that up. But just the comps are set with the level of what we dealt with hospitality in that vertical, in Fortune 1000, the level of where employees came back so strongly. I wouldn't suspect that you'll see anywhere near the level of growth that we've seen in the last couple of years, but we expect it to grow. Michael Hansen : Seth, I might point out that the last 2 years have -- they have been a significant recapture of what we sort of lost in that pandemic period of time. In our fiscal '22, that business grew organically over 50%; in fiscal '23, it was almost 30%. So there was a lot of recapture going on, but keep in mind that our longer-term goal for that business, Todd expects it to grow, but it's probably more of a low single-digit to mid-single-digit grower in our portfolio. Seth Weber : Right. Okay. Understood. And then maybe just on the First Aid and Safety business, given the margin strength that you're seeing there, can you talk about are you seeing any incremental competition in that space? Are you seeing any bigger players trying to get into that space or just smaller regional players getting more active? Todd Schneider : Yes. Good question, Seth. Certainly, it's a very competitive marketplace and First Aid products, Safety products, there is hundreds of competitors out there. There's many, many ways to procure those products, whether it be van delivered or e-commerce, you name it, we see it there.  But as a result of that, it's a very competitive market. And we've talked about the health and safety of employees being the #1 item that businesses are focused on. And when that occurs, there's certainly -- it attracts plenty of people into the marketplace because the value proposition of taking great care of employees is resonating with folks. And so yes, it's a very competitive environment, and I'm sure it will continue to be. Operator : And our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Stephanie Moore : Actually, maybe continuing on that last question there. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of the competitive landscape and your more core Uniform ancillary product segment? As you continue to win new business, where are you seeing the majority of that new business coming from? Is it nonprogrammers, some of the regional players, larger players? Any color there would be helpful. Todd Schneider : So I've been in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services business my entire career, 34 years. It's been highly competitive my entire career, and I'm sure it will continue to be that way. But we haven't seen a change in the landscape. It's always really competitive. So that being said, we -- our sales organization is highly skilled. And what we know is, there is a massive opportunity with the no program market. And for years, our organization has been focused on expanding the pie, and they are continuing to do exactly that. And when we talk about expanding the pie, they are -- those employees at a no programmer mean -- they're wearing garments, right? It's -- but they are -- they may be buying it themselves. They may be buying it through a catalog, it might be a centralized program for the company, but they're purchasing them.  And then we provide more value to them with the products and services that we offer, whether they're unique products like Carhartt or Chef Works or Landau, great branded programs. But the no-program market is really attractive for us, and we find that market sees really good value in what we're offering. So we're focused on expanding that high, and that will continue. Stephanie Moore : Got it. And just a follow-up, if I may. You noted that retention level continue to be really high. I'm just curious, in this current environment, what do you think is resonating the most with your customers that your sales force kind of goes in? Is it kind of the willingness to work with them on price? Is it the product offering, your scale? I'd love to just get your thoughts on what do you think is resonating the most to drive such a nice retention level. Todd Schneider : Yes. Great question, Stephanie. That's a very complicated answer because there's so many inputs to it. But it starts with being highly focused on taking incredibly good care of our customers and attracting and retaining the very best people. But then giving them product, services, tools so that they can not only have the intent to take great care of our customers, but do just exactly that. So -- and that gets into great products that I mentioned earlier, the service -- focus that we -- or the tools that we're making that make it easier to do business with us. But it gets down to our people and positioning them to take a really, really good care of our customers and then executing on that. And they're executing at a really high level.  And we talk often about when markets -- when things are challenging, when it's hard to attract people, when it's hard to procure products, when it's hard to operate in the marketplace, it gives us a chance to shine. And our culture is shining through. And our people are doing one heck of a job in taking care of our customers. Operator : And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Scott Schneeberger : Guys, you've certainly -- it sounds like you really want to speak to a SmartTruck because that's been going very well. I was hoping you could add also on automation to facilities. And where I'm going here, just kind of an update on where I'm going here is it sounds like you've been getting nice efficiencies and you still see more room to run. Is there any quantification you can put on that? I know you're looking for margins up this year overall business. But maybe just help us get an idea of what's at play there and how much you can do. Todd Schneider : Scott, I'll start. Mike, if you would like to chime in there. We're deploying technology, and you can call it automation, you can call it technology, you can call it digital. We're deploying that across all of our businesses and across all areas of our business as well, and we've been focused on that for years.  But there certainly is -- we're seeing some real benefits there with our investment with SAP, with our investments -- our partnerships with Google and with Verizon. And it's -- those are -- we see that there's plenty of opportunities still to come there to improve in the efficiencies of our business and to automate certain functions.  And we call it -- make it easier for our customers to do business and make it easier for our employee partners to take great care of our customers. The more we can invest there, we think it's an incredibly good use of our balance sheet because it positions us well for not just the short term, but the long term as well. Michael Hansen : Yes. There are so many details that go into all of the things that Todd just talked about, that it's really hard to put a number on it. Our goal is, as you've heard us say, is continue to improve margins. We have a number of different levers to do so. Our goal is incrementals in that 20% to 30% range, recognizing we're at the bottom of that range today. But it's hard to put a specific number on what's left because we're always working on what's -- what more can we do. And there are so many details and so many different projects we're working on. So our guide certainly does imply for continued margin improvement over last year, and that's the way we think about it. Scott Schneeberger : Great. Appreciate that. The -- you just referenced SAP, and you mentioned CapEx may be high end of the range this year, working on some implementation in the Fire segment. Could you just speak to -- would that have a tail to next year? How much more -- I mean, are we going to see SAP projects for years to come? Just a sense of what you have on the spend side going forward. Michael Hansen : From a Fire perspective, the -- we are in the midst of the early innings of the implementation. And so we'll see some pressure in the Fire margins a little bit this year and a little bit next year. The synergies and the benefits don't come overnight. It's not a flip of the switch.  And so we -- just like we did with the Rental business and the First Aid business before that, we need to get onto the platform. It takes a little bit of time to get really good at using the platform, and then we really start to see the benefits accelerate just like we have in First Aid and Rental. Now that's a -- Fire is a smaller part of our business, but we certainly expect that those benefits will come.  As it relates to SAP, SAP is not -- it's a journey, right? And we are -- even though we are on SAP and will be for most of our business after the Fire Protection business gets on, there are constant things to learn from SAP. There are new initiatives in working with SAP and Google and Verizon that create new and different things. And so we look at this -- I think Todd's talked about it as one of his largest initiatives in terms of technology.  And it's a journey. It's not a flip of the switch. We turn on new systems here and there. So we're in the midst of that. We'll continue to invest in all of that. And our expectation is, it's going to continue to bring benefits into the future. Todd Schneider : Scott, to expand upon what Mike said, it is a journey. But when you're on that journey, there is benefits -- a long, long tail of benefits as well. And so we will continue to invest appropriately. We have relationships at a very high level in each of those organizations, and it's going to bear fruit for us. And that's part of our plan.  It's not easy. It's very challenging to go through these processes. But our team has shown the wherewithal to not only digest the change, but then leverage the opportunities that are in front of them. Operator : And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Todd, maybe you can just peel the onion back a little bit more on that margin on the First Aid side? I know you pointed to some sourcing and stuff like that. But it seems like the business has gone from mid-teens to low 20s in the course of the year. And I was wondering if there -- is there something to do with the route optimization?  Is it mix related, pricing? Anything else that operationally made such a significant difference? And after that, I have just a question on the labor environment for you guys yourselves? Are you -- is it easier for you guys to source people for what you need? Todd Schneider : Good question, Shlomo. Yes. Again, we love the First Aid business. But we're -- there's so many inputs to margin expansion, and we're leveraging them all. It starts with really good revenue growth, and we're seeing that. And that's in a big way because the value proposition is resonating, the products, the services that we offer in the marketplace, trying to attract and retain people is still challenging. And people are trying to -- customers are trying to take really good care of their people. And we're benefiting from that and we're helping them accomplish exactly that. We're helping them run their business better. So that's helpful. The mix, as you know, has -- back during the pandemic, it was certainly so much more focused on safety products, a lot of clubs and a lot of sanitizer and those types of items. And that has abated a bit, and the mix is back focused on First Aid and those types of products, more recurring revenue type. And yes, we are absolutely leveraging technology to make it easier to do business, but also to position our partners, our employee partners to provide more value to our customers.  And SmartTruck is a component of that. We did have a little bit of energy tailwind, 40 basis points. But as Mike cited earlier, not all that's because of the price at the pump. That is also because we are extracting the inefficiencies out. And we always talk around here about how we don't make money when the wheels are moving. We make money when the wheels stop.  That's better for our customers, that's better for our employee partners. And all that is contributing. And then lastly, as I mentioned, our supply chain team has done a great job. They are leveraging the opportunities there. The larger we get in that business, the more leverage they have, and they're executing at a high level.  And -- so many inputs that are contributing to it, and -- but the -- what's really encouraging is, we see those having an opportunity to continue in the future. So certainly, no event is more of a process. Shlomo Rosenbaum : And then just the labor environment on your own, like for the people that you're sourcing? Todd Schneider : Yes. Pardon me. So from a labor standpoint, yes. As I mentioned earlier, it is easier, but not easy. And we are looking for great people. We want to hire not only people that are employed somewhere else, but happily employed, which is very challenging. And -- but we think we have a great employee value proposition as well.  And so we're highly focused on that. So -- but yes, easier than it was a year ago. But Shlomo, throughout my career, it's always been challenging. It's a little bit more challenging than it has been historically, but not what it once was a year ago or so. Operator : And our next question comes from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : I know there's a lot of questions and maybe thoughts on what happens to new sales. And I'm wondering, if you go back to kind of 2008, 2009 and hopefully never have that recession again. But if you look at new sales back then, how did Cintas perform for new sales? And any lessons from that you would take as we move forward? Todd Schneider : Yes, Kartik. First of all, we're a really different company today than we were in 2008, 2009. We have a much more diversified customer base. We're now -- today 70% of our customers are service is providing, 30% are goods producing. We have significant verticals that we didn't have as well, health care, education, government.  So we think we're really well positioned for whenever the next recession is. And I remember '08, '09 because I was running the sales organization back then. And our value propositions still resonated with people, and we still sold new business. And we did so at attractive rates. As I mentioned, it's not always are we asking for new money. Sometimes it's just a redirection of those from somewhere else to us, not only in a -- maybe a direct competitor standpoint, but also they're purchasing clothing, they're purchasing items to take care of the facilities. So we think we're well positioned. I might also mention, you didn't ask specifically about it, but we love having a pristine balance sheet. And we think whenever the next recession is that might open up opportunities for us. And just the fact that we've -- our organization is focused on fighting through whatever the economic environment is, taking great care of our customers, taking great care of our employee partners.  And we've grown sales in 52 of the last 54 years. And we suspect that whatever the economic environment is, we believe we're going to be successful in it. Michael Hansen : Kartik, I might add, Todd might be a little modest. He was running that organization. It was a difficult environment, and he and the sales team exceeded their internal goals and really continued to show that value even in tough times, as Todd mentioned. And as he also talked about, our customer base is quite a bit broader than it was back then, and our sales team is a little bit different. But the really good news is even back then, in the deepest, longest, broadest recession we'd seen in 100 years, we still sold a lot of new business. And it's a nice reflection of the value proposition that we have. Kartik Mehta : Yes. And just as a follow-up, if you look at the First Aid and Safety business, you're doing really well in it. Is there a way you would look at to say a certain percentage is recurring? Do you consider a certain percentage recurring? I know you don't have long-term contracts in that business. But just from a demand standpoint and what you've seen from a historical standpoint? Todd Schneider : Yes, Kartik, it's a good question. I don't have that in front of me, but I know it's -- it has returned much closer to historical or even higher as far as what we see from a repeat -- recurring type of revenue. And we want to provide value to the customers, whatever product services they want. It's just the nature of it, what we provide, whether it be First Aid supplies, access to AEDs, access to eyewash stations, access to clean water through our WaterBreak offering.  Those are all items that are really important to our customers more so today than they were pre-pandemic, and we think that, that trend will continue. Operator : And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Toni Kaplan : So one of your competitors has been talking about using a strategy where they're incentivizing their drivers to cross-sell products. Can you talk about why you don't use that strategy? What the disadvantages are that you have found when doing that? Todd Schneider : Yes. Great question, Toni. I'm glad you asked because my first job 34 years ago was on the trucks. And we have been cross-selling our products via our -- we call them our service sales representatives. We've been cross-selling them since I started, and I'm sure it was in place well before I started as well. So we see -- the fact that we have 12,000 or so trucks that roll out of our parking lots every single day that are focused on taking great care of our customers, when they roll out of those parking lots, they're spending time in those businesses.  And they have eyes. They have ears, they have minds, and they see what's going on in those businesses, and they see opportunities. And it always has been and always will be a key component of our growth trajectory because we see that infrastructure as a real advantage. And we leverage it and make sure that those service providers, either they provide more products and services or they provide a lead to provide more products and services based upon the nature of the product that the customer might be interested in. Michael Hansen : And Toni, we've talked a lot about this over the last -- more than 10 years, we've got customers of all different sizes, verticals, et cetera. And so while we do certainly expect those service sales reps to continue to penetrate and sell, we recognize that some businesses are just more complex than others, are larger than others.  And so sometimes, there's a strategy to enhance that opportunity. And it might be through, for example, in health care. We have dedicated people that really do reach out to the decision makers. So it's not just the service sales rep, but it's also other people that have relationship responsibilities that are looking for those new and different penetration opportunities.  It's not as simple just to simply say we're going to go in and have a service sales rep or an SSR go into each customer and sell it, all customers are so different. And so we need a strategy that can attack all types of customers, and we do. Todd Schneider : Toni, we know that our customer satisfaction scores are really good. And in large part because they really like our people. They like our service providers, our frontline service providers. And we leverage that. And whether it be, as Mike mentioned, a more -- a smaller type customer, we can cross-sell via the service provider. A larger one that's a little bit more complicated.  There might be a need for some air cover, for some help there. But nevertheless, that's always been an important component of our strategy and always will be. Toni Kaplan : That is super helpful. I wanted to also ask, I think the last few calls, you've been talking more about technology and investments and things of this sort. Are there any, I guess, technology capabilities that you think you still need? Will -- that you either are getting through hiring technology people or maybe even doing M&A? Like -- and maybe you've done it, maybe you still have yet to do, but are there any technology capabilities that you need that basically would be helped through M&A or hiring internally new technology people? Todd Schneider : Yes, Toni, great question. So we are always on the lookout for those opportunities. We think we have a really strong technology platform that we can build off of. But we know that the answer for what our customers are interested in is with spending time with our customers, and our employee partners are the ones who discern those opportunities.  So we're always asking now, how do we make it easier to do business, what -- is there any void? And frankly, that's where most of our investments have come from, that information, been trying to make it easier to do business with us. So we're always in search of trying to be a world-class service provider, but having an incredibly strong technology platform that makes it easier for our customers to do business with us, that makes it easier for our employee partners, our service providers to create a world-class experience for those customers. So yes, we're in search of whether it's -- we buy it or we bolt it on to our current platform or we created ourselves, all of those are of interest to us, and we'll be moving forward. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jared Mattingley for closing remarks. Jared Mattingley : Thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our second quarter of fiscal '24 financial results in December. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Jared Mattingley, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Jared Mattingley : Thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our fiscal 2024 second quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussions on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I will now turn the call over to Todd. Todd Schneider : Thank you, Jared. We are pleased with our second quarter results and are excited about the future. Second quarter total revenue grew 9.3% to $2.38 billion. Each of our businesses continue to execute at a high level. Our momentum in the business is good and volume remains robust. We can grow in a number of different ways. Contribution to our growth from new business remained strong and comes from companies that either outsource their program today or they are managing it themselves. We continue to have great success cross-selling to existing customers. Retention levels are strong and remain at very attractive levels, and our value proposition of image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance continues to resonate across businesses of all sizes and in all verticals. We continue to be pleased with the results from our focus on prospects within the verticals of healthcare, hospitality, education, and state and local government. We recently announced the opening of two cleanroom facilities, one in North Carolina and the other in Wisconsin. These facilities will provide additional capacity in these regions in order to expand our efforts in this area of attractive growth from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The benefits of our strong volume growth and revenue flowed through to our bottom line. Gross margin for the second quarter grew 11.6% and operating income grew 12.3%. Diluted EPS grew 15.7% to $3.61. Cash flow remained strong. Net cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter grew 17.8% over the prior year. Our strong cash flow gives us flexibility to choose how we deploy our capital. In the second quarter, we continued to invest in our businesses. We also acquired several smaller businesses. On December 15th, we paid shareholders $137.5 million in quarterly dividends, an increase of 17.1% from the amount paid the previous December. During the second quarter, we also purchased $320.3 million of Cintas common stock under our buyback program. I would like to thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders, and each other. Now, before turning the call over to Mike to provide details of our second quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $9.40 billion to $9.52 billion to a range of $9.48 billion to $9.56 billion, a total growth rate of 7.5% to 8.4%. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $14.00 to $14.45 to a range of $14.35 to $14.65, a growth rate of 10.5% to 12.8%. Mike? Mike Hansen : Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2024 second quarter revenue was $2.38 billion compared to $2.1 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate, adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 9%. Organic growth by business was 7.9% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 12.7% for First Aid and Safety Services, 17.8% for Fire Protection Services, and 4.7% for Uniform Direct Sale. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was $1.14 billion compared to $1.02 billion last year, an increase of 11.6%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 48% for the second quarter of fiscal \u201824 compared to 47% last year, an increase of 100 basis points. Strong volume growth and continued operational efficiencies helped generate this strong gross margin. Gross margin percentage by business was 47.4% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 54.5% for First Aid and Safety Services, 48.6% for Fire Protection Services, and 40.9% for Uniform Direct Sale. Gross margin for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment increased 40 basis points from last year. We continue to leverage our strong revenue growth and extract inefficiencies out of the business in order to expand margins. Our year-over-year improvements are no accident. Our Six Sigma and Engineering teams have helped us create efficiencies in the plant that allow us to maximize the utilization of our equipment, labor, and energy. Our SmartTruck technology allows us to improve our route efficiencies and provide density to our existing routes. While energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas, and electricity were a tailwind of 40 basis points from last year, please keep in mind that some of the energy benefit is the result of efficiencies just mentioned. As an example, our rental revenue grew organically at 7.9%, but we only added 1% to our route structure since last year. Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services segment increased 400 basis points from last year. Our revenue growth is strong and value -- our value proposition continues to resonate in this segment. Health and safety of employees remains top of mind. Our mix of revenues continues to be healthy, including growing high margin recurring revenue products like AED rentals, eyewash stations, and WaterBreak. We continue to use technology like SmartTruck to optimize our routes and improve efficiencies. And our first aid dedicated distribution center allows us to lower product costs. All of these contributes to our improved margins. Selling and administrative expenses grew $64.4 million or 11.1% over last year. Strong revenue growth creates leverage, which allows us to invest in the business. We continue to invest in our people, adding selling resources, investing in our management trainee program to develop future leaders, and expanding our talent acquisition efforts. Operating income of $499.7 million compared to $444.9 million last year. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 21% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 20.5% in last year's second quarter, an increase of 50 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 20.9% compared to 22.1% last year. The tax rates in both quarters were impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. Net income for the second quarter was $374.6 million compared to $324.3 million last year. This year's second quarter diluted EPS of $3.61 compared to $3.12 last year, an increase of 15.7%. Todd provided our annual financial guidance. Related to the guidance, please note the following. Fiscal \u201824 interest expense is expected to be $100 million compared to $109.5 million in fiscal \u201823, predominantly as a result of less variable rate debt. Our fiscal \u201824 effective tax rate is expected to be 21.3%. This compares to a rate of 20.4% in fiscal \u201823. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal \u201824 EPS guidance by about $0.16 and diluted EPS growth by about 120 basis points. Our financial guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks and guidance includes the impact of having one more workday in fiscal \u201823 compared to fiscal -- I'm sorry, fiscal \u201824 compared to fiscal \u201823. This extra workday comes in our fiscal third quarter. I'll turn it back to Jared. Jared Mattingley : Thanks, Mike. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now, we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up, if needed. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ashish Sabadra from RBC. Please go ahead, Ashish. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question. Just on the four verticals that you highlighted as areas of strength in particular. I was wondering if you can quantify how big the combined revenues are from those verticals and how does the growth profile there compare to the company average? Any color? Thanks. Todd Schneider : Good morning, Ashish. This is Todd. Thanks for the question. We don't -- I don't have any specific number for you as far as that exact number, but I can tell you that our verticals are performing quite well. We're having really good success. Our focus around not just selling but organizing around those is really paying off for us. And I've just got a couple of wins I can share with you regarding the verticals. In healthcare, in the acute space, we're having good success and non-acute as well. We\u2019ve got a scrub rental program to a big hospital network in South Carolina that is benefiting from a new consistent image but also identification. The customer told us that they were interested in being able to -- pardon me, identify their people, understanding who was supposed to be in what area and this new scrub program did that. We had a really similar experience with a nursing home in Virginia. Same thing. They were buying their own and they -- but the leadership wanted to be able to identify and have a consistent image with their people. We had a -- on the acute side, again a hospital in Florida that we rolled out a new microfiber program because they were struggling with inventory control and product quality, which led to cleanliness concerns. And our program offered some great products, technology to control the inventory, which allow them to focus more on their patients, instead of having a full run with trying to manage the microfiber. Excuse me. And then I've got a couple of other examples I thought might be helpful for the group. In our government sector, we have -- we just recently rolled out a first aid and AED rental program to a public library system in California, which is -- you wouldn't think of a public library system as being a great prospect for us, but it is. They realized that the value would bring to their employees and being prepared with the AEDs in case it was needed because the publics in their locations. And then lastly, I'll just share with you a little bit on education. A variety of wins there. We had a chemistry department at a nice-sized university in Virginia. They put all their educators and students in a lab tour program. The maintenance department at a University in California put all of their people in Carhartt uniforms, a rental program from us, they love the Carhartt. And then the last item would be there was a dining facility at a university in Arizona where they put all their culinary people in Chef Works, which is a big win for those folks. The branded programs with Carhartt and Chef Works were big wins. So, I don't want to belabor it, but I thought I would just share a few wins because I know verticals are of interest to yourself, Ashish, but also plenty of other folks on the call. Mike Hansen : Yeah. The only other thing I might add is, as Todd just talked about, we have so many ways to win, and clearly, those verticals are growing faster than the average. So we still are seeing really good momentum in each of those. Ashish Sabadra : That's great color and thanks for sharing those events. It does provide a lot more clarity on those verticals. And if I can ask a quick follow-up. I was just wondering if there is -- if you could share any update on your technology, the SmartTruck program, and particularly the partnership with Google, Verizon, and SAP, any updates on that front? Thanks. Todd Schneider : Certainly. I think how -- one of the things we have around here is we don't make money when the wheels are moving. We make money when the wheels stop. And -- so we're -- or the way Mike described it, in total for our company, we grew revenues over 9%, but we only added 1% to our route structure in total. So that means we're spending more time with the customer, less time driving, which is better for our customers, better for our partners, and better for Cintas. So we're pleased with that. Our technology and we still have plenty of room to go there. We're focused on bringing those efficiencies, extracting out the inefficiencies in our business. We sent out a note -- a press release regarding our migration this quarter to the Google Cloud, that has been very successful for us. There's a number of benefits that we get from moving from a server farm to the Google Cloud. The first one is it's more secure, so very important to us. Second item is, over time, we believe we will -- that'll be more cost-effective for us. And the third is it gives us access to Google's AI platform. So certainly in the very early innings, we just migrated, but we think that that will be able to help us longer term in making it more attractive, making it easier to do business with Cintas, making sure that we are positioning our people to be successful, to point them in the right direction and leverage that type of -- those types of tools. Operator : And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead, Manav. Manav Patnaik : Thank you. Todd, just to follow up on all the wins and contracts you talked about, maybe, I guess the question is more around the competitive environment versus is this just first time outsourcers? Any trends, any changes you're seeing from that front, the new business percentage you've called out before, but whether that's more market share or just first time outsourcing? Todd Schneider : Good morning, Manav. Great question. As Mike said, we win in many ways. We have been selling no programmers since the inception of my career, I can tell you that, and we continue to. And I'll just remind you, there is -- we service a little over a million businesses, but there's 16 million businesses in the US and Canada, so there's plenty of opportunity there. And we like both. We certainly win some from the competitors. We like growing the pie. And then the examples I was giving, it's a mix. But in large part, it is -- they were either doing it in house, meaning they were processing microfibers in house, or they were telling their employees to go buy product. So there's different variations of no programmers, meaning some are just -- were buying products and providing to their people and telling them to wear them. Some of them, they were just telling them to show up to work and look good. But nevertheless, we bring so much better consistent program identification, cleanliness, all these and compliance are big drivers for our customers. Manav Patnaik : Got it. And then just on the capital allocation front, I mean, the buyback number one of the bigger quarters for a while now. I mean, is that any indication of the M&A market slowing down or just how we should think about that balance there? Mike Hansen : Manav, we -- no change in what we're seeing in M&A. Still we're working the pipeline as best we can. We've made some nice acquisitions this year. From a buyback perspective, you've heard us speak to it being an opportunistic execution. And that's what you saw this quarter. As we think back about our first quarter results, and we thought they were pretty good, the stock reacted a little bit negatively, and we saw that as a nice opportunity and we took advantage of it. So that is a -- it was a good example during the quarter of an opportunistic execution of that buyback program. And the beauty, Manav, as we speak about our capital allocation, we don't always have to choose right in the quarter or maybe let's call it for the year. We've invested in the business as we've talked about. Our CapEx is up, which is important to us as a part of that investment. M&A is up from last year. Dividends are up 17% from last year, and we've been able to execute on the buyback program. So when you hear us talk about the sort of the four levers of capital allocation, we've done them all, I think, nicely this year. And again, the beauty of our cash flow and our balance sheet is we don't really have to choose. Todd Schneider : Mike, I would just add that we think we're being really good fiduciaries of our shareholders' investments. Mike mentioned all the levers. And the net-net of that is we still have great dry powder, which allows us to take on M&A of all shapes and sizes and we're interested in that. Operator : And our next question comes from Joshua Chan from UBS. Please go ahead, Joshua. Joshua Chan : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, Todd, you mentioned the opening of the cleanrooms. I was just wondering if you can kind of frame for us what you see as the attractive parts of this business. How is it attractive? And what kind of opportunity does it mean for Cintas going forward in the cleanrooms? Todd Schneider : Thanks for the question, Josh. Yeah, the cleanroom business is, it's an attractive sector for us. I mentioned pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and there's -- it seems like there's more and more every year that need that level of cleaning, that level of cleanliness. So, that is -- we think that bodes well for that business in the future. And there has been -- you've seen some momentum onshoring in that area. And we want to make sure that we have the appropriate capacity to serve our current customers and that we're prepared for the future as well. So, we like the trends in that business, and we like the business. Joshua Chan : Great. Thank you for the color there, Todd. And, in fact, if I can follow up with the margin question, I guess, if in the future, the energy favorability were to lessen, could you talk to the opportunities that you still have to drive margin expansion and the targeted incremental margins going forward without as much energy tailwind? Todd Schneider : Yeah. Great question. Yeah. So, we recognize that energy prices go up, they go down. But one thing that's going to be consistent is, we're going to be focused on extracting out inefficiencies in our route structure and in our production facilities. So, that will be really important to us. And we think there is certainly ample opportunity there still to go. We've talked about the SmartTruck technology, that's been impactful to us in many ways. But what's also impactful is, as Mike mentioned, our Six Sigma team of professionals, our Engineering professionals, and then layering in with that technology allows us to have a centralized visibility into our operations at a level that we've never had before in the history of the company this technology allows us. So -- and it allows us to maximize our labor, our equipment, ultimately our energy spend. So -- and we're focused on extracting out those inefficiencies, so that we can manage it moving forward. We love when energy goes -- costs go down, but we recognize those markets will move, but we're going to be focused on extracting out those inefficiencies. Operator : And our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please go ahead, Heather. Heather Balsky : Hi. Sorry about that. Thank you for taking my question. And first question with regards to the programmers and non-programmers, as we're further and further out from the COVID period, are you still seeing the shift in demand in terms of more non-programmers looking to outsource, or do you think it's starting to normalize back to pre-COVID trends? Todd Schneider : Well, Heather, it's a great question. I'll start. Mike, feel free to chime in. We're -- there's various reasons why a prospect would turn into a customer. Going from a no programmer to a customer. One of them is, hey, where we'd like to outsource it, because we're not very good at it or we're not -- we don't have -- we're struggling to staff and we're struggling to find people to manage this. So, that still continues. But there's other reasons. It might be, we don't like the image that we're portraying. We don't like the lack of identification. We don't like the lack of compliance. You can provide them, and we know that they're hygienically clean. So, there's many different motives. One of it might be, hey, we can't staff, and we need help. And we still see that, frankly. And it allows our customers to focus on what's most important to them, taking care of their customers, their patients, their guests, whatever it is, instead of having to manage through these various programs. Mike Hansen : Heather, the no programmers is still -- we get -- more than 60% of our new business comes from no programmers. Your reference to the pandemic might be, we did certainly, in the early days of the pandemic, see an increase in personal protective equipment and things like hand sanitizer. Those have normalized back to what we would call normal and ongoing levels, so that might be the only change that we had, and back to normal. Heather Balsky : Thank you. And then, on the margin front, we're just kind of curious, when you think about -- you talked earlier about opportunities for efficiencies and further route productivities, when you think about the source of those savings, how much are just organic Six Sigma efforts, how much is coming from your SAP, and are there still G&K synergy or opportunities that you're kind of benefiting from? Thanks. Todd Schneider : Heather, it's a good question. We don't really discern the difference between our Six Sigma team, our Engineering team and our Technologies. They all have to work, be orchestrated appropriately to get the efficiencies, so -- and that's exactly what we're doing. So, everybody has to be involved. And that's what produces the great results. As for G&K, yeah, we're -- we now -- we\u2019re I think about six and a half years since we acquired, if my math is correct. So, yeah, I wouldn't say that there's anything left on the bone there. Operator : And your next question comes from Andy Wittmann from RW Baird. Please go ahead, Andy. Andy Wittmann : Yeah, great. Thanks. Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. I guess, I just wanted to ask on the outlook a little bit here, Mike. The second half total revenue guidance is in the 7% range at the midpoint against an organic 9% quarter here. So, a degree of deceleration. I guess that was implicit in your previous guidance as well. But just thought maybe give you a chance to elaborate a little bit more on that, talk about what you're seeing in the macro, if that's just you guys being kind of your normal prudent approach, or if there's something that we should be considering? Mike Hansen : Andy, I'd lead with it's our normal prudent approach. And when you think about where we are, we've talked a little bit already about growth is still good, momentum is good, and so we like where the business is going. The range for the back half of the year does -- certainly does imply a little bit over 7% at the midpoint, a little over 8% at the high point. We like that range. The cadence is good for us, as you know. But, look, as we look into calendar \u201824, there certainly is a little bit of uncertainty as to what the new economy may bring, what the Fed movements may bring, and so we think it is wise to be prudent as we look out. Andy Wittmann : Great. That's my only question for today. Have a Merry Christmas, guys. Todd Schneider : Thank you, Andy. Operator : And our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, George. George Tong : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Earlier you mentioned that business momentum was good. Volumes were robust in the quarter. Can you provide more color on overall customer budget trends and customer sentiment, and any changes that you might be seeing in the sales cycle? Todd Schneider : George, we -- good morning, George. We -- forward-looking, as Mike said, there's always -- we're not trying to prognosticate exactly how our customers will react to the turning of the calendar year, but we're not seeing any change in sales cycles, and we haven't seen a change in our customer base and they're -- how they're reacting to what's going on in the marketplace. So, it's kind of business has been consistent, and it's more what Mike referred to the turn of the calendar year. And we'll see how businesses react coming out of the holidays. George Tong : Got it. That's helpful. And also you mentioned cross selling was good in the quarter. Can you elaborate more on cross selling trends that you're seeing, in which areas you're seeing most amount of bundling or upsell, cross sell from? Todd Schneider : Yeah, George. Cross sell is -- it's an important component of our growth, and the nature of it is we're having good success across all of our areas of our business. We're blessed to be in a position where our customers, fortunately, they really like us. They like our relationships. We have people in their businesses on a really frequent basis, mostly on a weekly basis. So they -- and we have -- so that means we have eyes, ears, and minds in their business and we can help. And it doesn't matter to us what a customer might lead with, whatever they're interested in, but then we will quickly pivot and we can help them in many ways. So -- but just the nature of the size of the rental division is such that because there is -- are so many customers there, there's plenty of opportunity for our First Aid and Fire business to cross onto that just because of the numbers there. But nevertheless, it's working quite well across all of our organization. We share leads, we share thoughts, and we make sure that the customer is well taken care of. Operator : And our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please go ahead, Tim. Tim Mulrooney : Yeah, good morning. I just wanted to ask one question. Pricing now normalized back to the 2% range. That means your organic growth was comprised of approximately seven points of volume. I was just hoping you could dig into that a little bit more as it was a little stronger than I think most of us were expecting. Did you see an uptick in retention? Did you have a strong quarter with that cross sell? Or maybe new account growth and any details would be helpful. Todd Schneider : Yeah, good morning Tim. So our new business is robust. As I mentioned, retention levels are very good and our cross-sell is very good. And the pricing is still, it's lower than last year. It is higher than historical, but it's certainly getting much closer to historical. So -- but when you -- so when you think about that, it is -- our various inputs to growth are all performing well, and we expect that to continue. Mike Hansen : And as we talk, we win in a lot of ways. And the momentum in the rental business is still really good. But we also saw in the quarter some really nice acceleration in First Aid and Safety from 11% in the first quarter to 12.7% organically in the second quarter. And we saw some nice improvement in Fire where we went from a little over 14% in the first quarter to 17.8% in the second quarter. So we just see some really good momentum in all of our businesses. And particularly those two had some really nice performance in the second quarter. Tim Mulrooney : Yeah, I did notice that re-acceleration across both those businesses. That's helpful color. Thanks, guys. Happy holidays. Todd Schneider : Thank you, Tim. You as well. Operator : And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead, Andrew. Andrew Steinerman : Hi. Could you just mention if your ad stops directionally and the uniform rental business was up, down, or flat recently? Todd Schneider : Good morning, Andrew. Our ad stop metrics are -- have been pretty consistent. We haven't seen much of a change in our customer base. And so I'd say that's how I would describe it. We see still positive trends in our ad stop metrics, but that's pretty consistent as it has been for the last six to twelve months. Andrew Steinerman : Okay, thank you very much. Todd Schneider : Yes sir, thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Jasper Bibb from Truist Securities. Please go ahead, Jasper. Jasper Bibb : Hey, good morning guys. You mentioned year-on-year tailwind from energy. But was just hoping to get some additional color on other cost inputs, I guess specifically, labor and materials. Todd Schneider : Yeah, I'll start, Jasper. Good morning. Our -- we're seeing -- just like you're seeing with inflation in total, we're seeing that come down. It's never coming down as fast as we like, but we are seeing it. Cotton is stabilized. We're seeing freight come down and that's important to us. And the labor market is easier. It's still not easy, but it is easier. So I think that probably the right way to think about it would be as the labor market eases, and that will lessen pressure on wage growth as well. Jasper Bibb : Thanks. And then I wanted to follow up on first aid. Operating margins there were really strong in the first half. Should we think about these like low 20% levels as sustainable going forward? And would you say there's anything that's changed there that's unlocked another leg of operating margin expansion here today? Mike Hansen : Sure. Jasper, we have seen some nice performance in that business and I spoke to a few of them where from a margin perspective, first of all, the value that we sell with, nothing is more important than the health and safety of your employees is really still resonating well. And so our growth has been really good in that business. We talked a little bit in the opening comments about sort of the recurring revenue streams of AED rentals, our eyewash stations and our WaterBreak. And these have been great businesses for us. The growth has been really good and the margins are great for us. Many times these are add-on products to existing customers. But in all three of them, we install, and then we have a recurring service program that goes on after that. And again, it leads to really nice stickiness and also nice margins. The other thing that I'll point out is we opened a first aid and safety distribution center a couple years ago and that allows us to source more. It allows us to centralize some of our sourcing, and those kind of things lead to a better product cost, and that again drives down the material cost in our first aid and safety business. So the combination of really good sales mix, really good growth in the business, good sourcing, the one I didn't mention was SmartTruck technology that is also having a benefit there. All of those things are contributing. And so this is not a case of six months of sort of unusual items. This is a little bit of a lot of hard work and execution by our first aid and safety partners to really get this margin going. Jasper Bibb : Very helpful. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : And our next question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank Securities. Please go ahead, Faiza. Faiza Alwy : Yes, hi, thank you, Todd. So I wanted to follow up on both the first aid business and the fire business. You touched on the first aid a little bit, but curious on what's driving the acceleration, if you could expand on that, both on first aid and fire. And then as we think about your outlook, do you expect this level of growth to sustain looking ahead? And, I know in fire, you talked about an SAP implementation that was happening in this fiscal year. So maybe is that helping the top line? Has that happened? How should we think about margins going forward in that business? Todd Schneider : Good morning, Faiza. Thanks for the question. We really like the fire business. It's the only business we're in where you legally have to have it. So there is, I'll call it double negative, no program market. Everyone is a programmer. But we are able to cross-sell very well into that market. We're using various technologies that Mike referenced to make sure that we're positioning our partners to be more successful, meaning we use SmartTruck technology in all of our businesses, and that helps us. But we're getting leverage from our growth. And the growth is attractive. And we think it's \u2013 there\u2019s certainly -- running a business isn't linear. So there will be ebbs and flows, but we like the long-term outlook for the fire business. That being said, as you mentioned, we are going through an SAP implementation. We certainly -- we haven't even implemented at this point, so we haven't seen any benefits just yet, but we're optimistic about how that can help our business over the coming years. Mike Hansen : Maybe I'll add two things to the fire, and a little bit of first aid too. The market opportunity in those businesses is really large and our expectation as we've talked about is that those businesses will continue into the future near that double digit type of a place. Again, the market opportunity is really large. One last comment on the SAP, we've not started it. And so as we get into that, which is likely going to be more about next fiscal year, we may see a little bit of pressure in the fire segment because as you can imagine, when you turn -- when you start to go into an SAP conversion, you don't get benefits overnight. It takes a little bit of time. So we'll have some additional costs in \u201825 and certainly then setting up really nice benefits into the future for that business. Faiza Alwy : Great, thank you. And then if I could just follow up on the macro environment, you made some comments in response to a previous question around just you\u2019re being prudent and there is some uncertainty. Just given sort of how well you are doing [with no programmers] (ph) and the momentum you are seeing in sort of these other businesses, I'm curious if you can give us a framework in terms of how we should think about the impact of macro on your business. Todd Schneider : Well, I'll start, Faiza, with, our history has been we grow certainly in multiples of GDP and employment growth and you hit it. We are able to sell into no programmers. Even when they're not, let's say, adding people, we can take pressure off of them by managing programs for them. So our new business effort is always really good. But certainly, if we see turns in the economy, we've got to adjust potentially. If we see our customers start to reduce their number of people, we've got to adjust. And so it is prudent for us to sort of think about that as we look into our guidance and into the future of the business. Faiza Alwy : Understood, thank you so much. Operator : And our next question comes from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Seth. Seth Weber : Hey, good morning and happy holidays, guys. I wanted to just go back to the clean room discussion for a minute. If there's any way to frame how we should be thinking about that, new facility openings, and are those facilities higher CapEx relative to a traditional facility? Is there any way to combine facilities or I'm just trying to get a better understanding of this opportunity and what the investment might be for Cintas going forward? Thanks. Todd Schneider : Yeah, Seth, thank you for the question. As you know, that's a segment of the uniform market. As I mentioned earlier, it does seem more companies over the last decade or so have higher cleaning quality requirements, so we think there's a tailwind there. As far as the CapEx required for a facility like that, you can think of it as very similar to a uniform facility. The only difference I think that you may want to think about is, it serves usually a larger geographic area than we would with a traditional facility. And the reason being is we only have so many of them and they have to cover the customer base. So as a result of that, we do cover a larger geographic area for -- out of each of those facilities. Seth Weber : Okay, that's helpful. Is there any way for us to think about how many of these facilities you might be opening over the next couple of years relative -- I mean I saw the press release for the Wisconsin facility, but is this order of magnitude ones and twos or could this be much bigger going forward? Todd Schneider : Yeah, Seth, I wouldn't -- you're not going to see ones and twos coming out every quarter or every year based upon the size of the market. So it certainly won't be anywhere near that pace. But it will be paced based upon the demand from the marketplace. If there's more and more customers that are interested in it, then we'll be prepared to meet that demand. Seth Weber : Okay, that's helpful, thanks. And then maybe just a quick follow up on the direct, it's nice to see the direct sales business turn positive again in the quarter. Is there any color on whether that's coming more from the service side of your customer base, more of the manufacturing side, and any just detail there or is it just kind of across the board? Todd Schneider : Good question, Seth. The design collective business, the direct sale portion of it, we've spoken in the past, it's certainly lumpier. And so as far as where that growth is coming from, it's really more national accounts, where we would get it, hospitality, lodging. And when they have rollouts or new allotment programs, you tend to get spikes. And then -- so we love the spikes and then the, what comes after the spike isn't as good, but I wouldn't think about it as a big growth engine for us. Mike Hansen : Yeah, we typically would say in the low to mid-single-digit growth. So this quarter is sort of in line with that expectation. Operator : And our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Please go ahead, Stephanie. Stephanie Moore : Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to touch a bit on maybe the cross-sell opportunity over time. I think you've provided -- you continue to execute very well on your investments, particularly on the technology front and called out this enhanced visibility that you have. So maybe you can talk about, given some of these investments, what this might mean for cross-selling, meaning the opportunity to add those additional products and kind of continue to further penetrate each existing customer. So kind of how are you balancing the incremental products that you can offer over time? Thanks. Todd Schneider : Good morning, Stephanie. Well, you can think about it -- we call it cross-sell. There's -- cross-sell is really division to division. There's also upsell which would be, we have products that our customers don't use all of our products, even within the rental division, or the first aid division, and what have you. So, those are all components of growth for us, and we see a significant, massive, frankly, runway in all those areas. So we're trying to position our employee partners to make sure that they're in the right spot and have the right information to help the customer. And then we're also continually, it's part of our corporate culture, is to invest in new products and new services. We're always working on that. And we get those ideas from those customers and then we test them and then we launch them and we're always working on that. It's always been a component of our growth and always will be. Stephanie Moore : Thank you. Appreciate it. Todd Schneider : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, Scott. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Happy holidays. I -- my first one, I'm going to delve into the SG&A running low double digits growth, something you did last year as well. And you cited investment in selling resources, management training program, tech, and also some talent acquisition efforts. Just curious, and you guys have said on this call, labor is getting better but still a little tough. Could you elaborate on the labor aspect and kind of what you guys are doing pushing the selling? And then also curious about the tech aspect. Maybe you've already covered it in the call if that's what you meant, but just wondering if there's anything extra there? Thanks. Todd Schneider : Yeah. Good morning, Scott. We\u2019re -- the items that you mentioned, they're all really important to us. We are -- there's not one that I would call out, but I would think about it this way. We think the future's really bright and we want to invest for the future. We know we need the talent acquisition team to be attracting the very best talent. The management trainee programs are leaders of the future, and we think they are a critical pipeline, and we're going to need those leaders. And then the selling resources are, we see the -- it looks, we think the future's bright with our, how many customers we have, what the size of the market is. I mentioned 1 million customers, about 16 million businesses. So that's all great. And then you kind of wrap it all with technology, because technology will, we want to make it easier to do business with us, and we want to leverage technology to make our partners more successful. Point them in the right direction, give them the right tools in their toolbox to spend their time in the right spots, but also to make it easier for the customer to buy, easier to do business with in totality. Scott Schneeberger : Great, thanks, appreciate that. And then, not a lot of acquisition activity in the quarter, but there was some, and there was a good amount in the first quarter. I remember you saying it was across all businesses, but we didn't hit it up too much last quarter. Could you talk about what it is that you're acquiring and clearly across segments, but what the strategies have been there? Thanks. Mike Hansen : Sure, not a lot of change in the strategy, Scott, and that is we love rental tuck-in opportunities and we've made a number of those this year. And as you can imagine, when we do that in a marketplace, we add immediate capacity utilization improvement, route density, and so those things really help us in the rental business. So we've made some of those. We certainly have made some first aid acquisitions, and we've made fire acquisitions. Again, the dynamic is similar in all three of these. These are really nice tuck-in opportunities that just strengthen our business in the local markets in which we acquire them, and we'll continue to look for those opportunities as best we can. Todd Schneider : One thing I might add is, to Mike's point, we get synergies. It helps us with density, helps us with capacity utilization, allows us to spend more time with the customers. So all that's valuable, but in each of the businesses, depending upon the business we acquire. But normally when we make an acquisition in rental, first aid, or fire, we're able to provide an offering to that customer base that's broader than what they had in the past. So the rental waiver broader offering than most companies out there, certainly in the first aid we do as well. And depending upon the [fire] (ph) acquisition, that's very consistent. Separate from, then we can cross sell. So it adds nice value. Operator : And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Please go ahead, Shlomo. Shlomo, is you line muted? Shlomo Rosenbaum : Sorry, my line was muted. This is a question basically for Mike, just a little bit going through some of the technical items in the quarter. Receivables days were up two days sequentially. I was wondering if there was a lot of business that came in at the end of the quarter. Are you seeing any changing patterns in what clients are paying or any other factors in that because the last time we saw 48 days was during COVID. Mike Hansen : Shlomo, when our quarters end on a holiday and it seems like too many of them do, it does create a little bit of disruption in terms of the ability to collect the mail, the application. We have seen maybe just a touch of slowing in the AR, but we've not seen any, I'll say deterioration from the standpoint of additional write-offs. But we did see a little bit of slowing, and the Thanksgiving holiday can usually contribute to that. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Then in the OPM, the operating margin, the other unit was up very nicely sequentially, even though there's one less day sequentially in the quarter. Could you just give us some of the mechanics or tell us just what's going on on the ground over there? It's increasing the margin very nicely and is that something that we should expect to continue at kind of that 16% level? Mike Hansen : Well we -- certainly the revenue growth is powerful in all of our businesses and when we see some really nice revenue growth, that's important. The other thing that I would say is you know the uniform direct sale business went from a negative 2.7% in terms of revenue growth to 4.7%. And that is important for operating margins too. So we did see some nice improvement there in the direct sale. Nothing I would say that is noteworthy other than, again, some nice acceleration in the revenue. Operator : And our next question comes from Leo Carrington from Citigroup. Please go ahead, Leo. Leo Carrington : Thank you, and good morning. If I could ask a follow up on that point around the one-off or the cost that you called out in Q2 around current acquisition, training, technology. Were you calling them out to any of these one-off increases in nature or more to highlight where the spend is? And then in terms of the underlying margins and drop through in Q2 on your organic growth, do you see that as sustainable when you factor in the additional investment this quarter? Mike Hansen : Well, Leo, I\u2019ll start with, we call them out because we think it's important to make sure that our investors understand that we are looking at the long term and we want to continue to invest in the business. And those investments are really important and they set up, let's say, more penetration opportunities, more cross-sell opportunities, but also productivity improvements, capacity utilization opportunities. In these cases, we wanted to call them out to show that, look, we're focused on the long-term and we're going to continue in the business. As Todd said a couple times, the future is bright for us and we want to make sure that we take advantage of that bright future by investing in the business and the call outs were really more about that. The future is bright. In the quarter, we had incremental margins of 27%. Look, our expectation is that we're going to be in the 20% to 30% range going forward. We recognize that when we're sitting at 21%, they need to be in the higher level of that range. And we think that\u2019s -- that we can continue to do that. And when we talk about things like SAP and technology and other investments, and by the way, we're able to get 27% even when we're investing in the business. But we give those to say we're setting up those future margin and revenue opportunities. It's important for us to, I think, communicate that. Leo Carrington : Very clear. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Toni. Toni Kaplan : Thanks very much. You mentioned the success that you've had with the branded products earlier, particularly with Carhartt and Chef Works. Could you just remind us if these are exclusive relationships and how long the relationships are for and then are there any other areas that could benefit from branded products or equipment that you could offer as well? Todd Schneider : Good morning, Toni, thank you for the question. So we've had a long standing relationship with Carhartt and Chef Works, and we are the exclusive licensees for those folks, for those companies on the rental programs. And so we work with them to design products that the end users want, want to wear, and -- but also that goes very well through our processing systems. So that's all very important to us. As far as, we don't get into contractual arrangements with them, but I can tell you this. We love products that our end users are, that get excited about wearing them. And Carhartt and Chef Works are two great examples of that, in great companies, great brands, great products. And as far as are there other opportunities, we're constantly looking for that. And we spend a lot of time with our customers and with our working partners to talk about that and to see where those opportunities do come from. But those are two great relationships, long-standing relationships that are really important to us. Toni Kaplan : Yep, terrific. And maybe if you could just give us your latest thoughts on potential international expansion, that'd be great. Thanks. Todd Schneider : I'd say, similar to products, we're always looking at those types of opportunities. We certainly know, stay in contact with the people that are running those businesses. But the great news is we don't have to do that to -- in order to be really, really successful in the future. We look at it and say there's, again, we're servicing about 1 million businesses. There's 16 million businesses in US and Canada. Here's what's really exciting is by the time we get to 2 million customers, there will be more than 16 million businesses in the US and Canada. So that's kind of a bummer if you're running a race but it's really exciting if you're running a business because once we get to the 2 mile mark, the race is going to be extended. So that's separate from -- we're going to have more products and services over the coming year. So all that being said is, we continue to watch it, we evaluate it, we look for the right opportunity, and if that opportunity presents itself, then we will seize it, but it's certainly not -- it's not required in order for us to be successful in the future. Operator : And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jared Mattingley to close out the call. Jared Mattingley : Thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our third quarter of fiscal \u201824 financial results in March. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jared Mattingley, Vice President and Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Jared Mattingley : Thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our fiscal 2024 third quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'll now turn the call over to Todd. Todd Schneider : Thank you, Jared. Due to the outstanding dedication and execution of our employees, whom we call partners, we delivered very strong results for our third quarter. Total revenue for the third quarter grew 9.9% to $2.41 billion. The revenue dollars represent record quarterly revenue. We are pleased with the performance of each of our businesses. Our revenue growth remains robust and we have good momentum in the business. New business remains strong. Our sales team continues to operate at a high level. We are seeing broad success across the many verticals, particularly within our focus verticals, as well as our cross-selling efforts and penetration of new products and services within our existing customers. Retention levels are strong and remain at very attractive levels. Our strong revenue growth flowed through to our bottom line. Gross margin for the third quarter increased 220 basis points to a record 49.4%, an increase of 14.9%. Operating income was a record 21.6%, an increase of 16.6%. Diluted EPS grew a robust 22.3% to $3.84. Cash flow remains strong. Net cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter grew 32.8% over the prior year. In the third quarter, we continued to invest in our businesses through capital expenditures of $107 million. During the third quarter, we made acquisition purchases of $111 million. On March 15th, we paid shareholders $137.6 million in quarterly dividends, an increase of 17.1% from the amount paid the previous March. Our strong cash flow gives us flexibility to choose how we deploy our capital and through three quarters, we have deployed over $1.4 billion of capital across our priorities of capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, and buybacks. I would like to thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders, and each other. Before turning the call over to Mike to provide details of our third-quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $9.48 billion to $9.56 billion to a range of $9.57 billion to $9.6 billion, a total growth rate of 8.6% to 8.9%. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $14.35 to $14.65, to a range of $14.80 to $15, a growth rate of 13.9% to 15.5%. Mike? Mike Hansen : Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2024 third-quarter revenue was $2.41 billion, compared to $2.19 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and a difference in the number of workdays was 7.7%. Total growth was positively impacted by 170 basis points due to the extra workday. We remind you, as you update your models for next fiscal year that there will be two less workdays compared to this current fiscal year. Each quarter next year will have 65 workdays, which means, the first and the fourth quarters will each have one less workday than this fiscal year. Organic growth by business was 7.1% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 11.5% for First Aid and Safety Services, 13.9% for Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale was down 3.9%. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.19 billion, compared to $1.03 billion last year, an increase of 14.9%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 49.4% for the third quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 47.2% last year, an increase of 220 basis points. Strong volume growth, technology improvements, and continued operational efficiencies helped generate this strong gross margin. Gross margin percentage by business was 48.8% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 56.3% for First Aid and Safety Services, 48.8% for Fire Protection Services, and 41.1% for Uniform Direct Sale. Gross margin for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment increased 170 basis points from last year. Energy was a tailwind of 40 basis points. In addition, we continue to leverage our strong revenue growth, our technology investments and extract inefficiencies out of the business through our Six Sigma and engineering teams. Our technology investments have allowed us to improve garment sharing among our plants, which improves material cost. Our SmartTruck technology allows us to improve our route efficiencies and provide route densities to our existing routes, which positively impacts truck purchasing, labor, and energy. Our Six Sigma and engineering teams have helped us create efficiencies in the plant that allow us to maximize the utilization of our plant equipment, labor, and energy. Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services segment increased 470 basis points from last year. Strong revenue growth continues to help expand our margins in this segment. Strong revenue performance in some of our high-margin recurring revenue products like AED Rentals, eyewash stations, and WaterBreak continues to provide a healthy revenue mix. Our technology investment in SmartTruck continues to provide route optimization and improved efficiencies. And our First Aid dedicated distribution center allows us to lower product costs. All of these contributed to improved gross margins. Selling and administrative expenses increased 90 basis points from last year. The increase was driven by investments in selling resources, technology and our management trainee program, as well as costs associated with an agreement in principle to settle the purported class action contract dispute brought by plaintiffs City of Laurel. We determined that settling the claim is in the best interest of Cintas. The total monetary payment agreed to in the proposed settlement, including the 60 basis points recognized in this quarter is $45 million. We expect that the settlement costs will not impact our financials in future periods. As Todd mentioned earlier, we generated strong cash flow. For the year, our free cash flow increased 31.6%. This has allowed us to invest back into the business, which has resulted in capital expenditures of 4.3% for the year. Our investments include technology to grow the top line and expand margins, automation to improve efficiencies in our plants and additional processing capacity where needed. We expect capital expenditures to finish around 4.25% of revenue for the year. Operating income of $520.8 million compared to $446.8 million last year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue was 21.6% in the third quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 20.4% in last year's third quarter, an increase of 120 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 19.9% compared to 22.1% last year. The tax rates in both quarters were impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. Net income for the third quarter was $397.6 million compared to $325.8 million last year. This year's third-quarter diluted EPS of $3.84 compared to $3.14 last year, an increase of 22.3%. Todd provided our annual financial guidance. Related to the guidance, please note the following. Fiscal '24 interest expense is expected to be $99 million compared to $109.5 million in fiscal '23, predominantly as a result of less variable rate debt. Our fiscal '24 effective tax rate is expected to be 20.6%. This compares to a rate of 20.4% in fiscal '23. Our guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks. As I mentioned earlier, we expect that the proposed settlement will not impact our financials in future periods and accordingly, there is no impact on our guidance. Guidance includes $17.4 million of acquired revenue for the fourth quarter. This revenue includes the impact of the recently announced acquisitions during the third quarter. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now, we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Manav Patnaik from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead, Manav. Ronan Kennedy : Hi, good morning. This is Ronan Kennedy on for Manav. Thank you for taking my questions. Can I just ask, with regards to the strong margin performance, can you kind of assess or characterize the contributions from, whether it's the SmartTruck, the Six Sigma, the engineering extracting of inefficiencies? But also how we should think about those as drivers in the context of the sustainability of the margins, if you could elaborate on that, please? Todd Schneider : Thank you for your question, Ronan. It's -- when you think about the gross margin, it really starts with our culture, how we run our business, the expectations we have, the intensity of which we run it, and the focus. That being said, there's many, many inputs to those numbers. Certainly, our investments that we are making are paying off. The investments in SmartTruck, the investments in our Six Sigma team, the investment in our engineering team, the investment in our supply chain organization are all helping us to improve those results. So I can't give you an exact number with, hey, SmartTruck gave us X basis points, what have you. It's -- there's many inputs, and we're pleased with the investments that we've made, and we're pleased with the leadership and the culture of the organization, where they're focused on driving those results, providing a better experience for our customers and providing a better experience for our employee-partners. Ronan Kennedy : That's helpful. Thank you. And then with regards to obviously, strong performance on the top line as well, can you just talk about the contributions from new business and penetration versus expectations, how pricing is trending, and also retention, please? Todd Schneider : Yeah, good question. So when we think about our growth, again, there's many contributing factors. We really like where we are from a growth standpoint, the internal growth, certainly we like the acquisitions that we've made. They're really good businesses. But when we think about the components of it, certainly pricing is a component, but it is not the majority. The majority of our growth is from volume growth. And that's really pleasing to us because we want to be able to grow our business in that manner. Pricing is -- has moderated and it's much closer to historical, and that's exactly what we had planned throughout the year. Where we're really benefiting is from our new business. Our team is performing at a high level. Our service organization is -- the retention levels are very attractive. And then we are cross-selling appropriately. We have a great breadth of products and services that we want to make sure that our customers and our prospects are aware of. And so we're benefiting kind of across all, not kind of, we are benefiting across all of those areas, and they're all big contributing factors, but we like where we are and we like how we're growing the business. Operator : And our next question comes from Joshua Chan from UBS. Please go ahead, Joshua. Joshua Chan : Hi. Good morning, Todd and Mike. Thanks for taking my questions. Could you talk about the -- I guess, piggybacking on the prior question, could you talk about the sustainability of growth that you're seeing now that the pricing has moderated to a historical level? Do you see the current run rate staining based on what you're seeing out there, talking to customers and retention rate dynamics, and all that? Todd Schneider : Yeah, Josh, good morning. Again, we like where we are from a growth standpoint. The exciting thing is there's -- we service a little over a million customers. There's 16 million businesses in North America, so we're -- we think there's an incredible runway for us. So we're selling to -- about 60% of our new accounts come from no programmers, and that is continuing. So we're seeing great results from talking to prospects and showing them a better way to do it than they are today. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that, that is new spend. They might be spending that money somehow. It's just we're redirecting it to do it better, smarter, faster, in some cases, even less expensive than the way they're doing it. So we think the runway is very attractive because of the number of prospects that are out there and our business -- or, excuse me, our buying proposition resonating with prospects and customers. So, we expect that we like where we are from a growth standpoint. As I mentioned, we like how we're growing and we want to continue in that manner. Joshua Chan : That's great color. Thank you. And for my follow-up, you talked about incremental margins being in the 20% to 30% range historically, and now you're sort of at the higher end of that in recent years. Is this the right level of incremental margins going forward on revenue growth that comes ahead? Todd Schneider : Yeah. So we're -- we recognize the math of 20% to 30% incremental margins. We need to be the higher end of that in order to continue to improve our margins and we're focused on doing that. We're doing so by extracting out those inefficiencies, getting really good leverage on our revenue growth, so many ways. But running a business is not linear. And so, we know there's going to be some puts and takes and some quarters will be higher and some won't be as high. But generally speaking, we like that range. And I prefer the higher end than the lower end, that's for sure. Operator : And our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please go ahead, Heather. Heather Balsky : Hi. Thank you. I was hoping you could just talk about the M&A you did this quarter and what attracted you to the assets. And then an update on how to think about M&A going forward. Todd Schneider : I'm certainly happy to start, Mike. Regarding -- Heather, good morning. And regarding M&A, so it's an important component for us. You certainly cannot pace M&A. So they kind of come as they do, and it takes two to dance. And -- but I can tell you the two that we announced this past quarter are great businesses first off, really good operators, really attractive businesses. In the case of the one in Kentucky, it provided us with some needed capacity in that region of the country. In addition to the added capacity, we were able to absorb that volume into seven of our facilities. So some really nice synergies allows us to, as we're closer to the customers, to spend more time with the customer and less time driving. So that's important to us. In the case of the acquisition in the M&A in Pennsylvania, we did not acquire any additional capacity. But in that case, we were able to absorb it into 16 of our facilities. So again, attractive synergies, more time with the customer, less time driving. And in those cases, we also then get to talk to our new customers about the broader breadth of products and services that we have. So we think it's -- overall it's very attractive. As I mentioned, it takes two to dance. You can't pace it. But in this case, these were two really attractive businesses, great operators that really made sense for us. Mike Hansen : Maybe a couple added points. As Todd said, these are great acquisitions, and we've had a handful of them this fiscal year. Each of the two that Todd talked about is less than $20 million in annual revenue. The $17.4 million that we gave you in our prepared remarks includes the impact of those. But keeping in mind, we've made acquisitions all year long, and so that fourth quarter impact would include all of the acquisitions we've made throughout the last 12 months. Just something to keep in mind as you're thinking about our fourth quarter. Heather Balsky : Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : And our next question comes from Andy Wittmann from RW Baird. Please go ahead, Andy. Hello, Andy. Is your line muted? Andy Wittmann : I'm sorry about that. Mike, I just want to build on that last question where you were commenting on the M&A contribution. Is there any -- in your fourth quarter guidance, is there a change in your fundamental outlook for the company, recognizing that it is up now somewhat on these two -- somewhat larger acquisitions that you did? And then as an addendum to that, was this 60 basis points or $45 million legal settlement that you just talked about, was that included and considered in your initial guidance? Or are you absorbing that and still able to raise your guidance here? Mike Hansen : Yeah. So, Andy, I already forgot your first part of the question. What was your first part? Andy Wittmann : First question is, does your fundamental outlook for the business unchanged? Mike Hansen : Yeah, yeah. Andy Wittmann : Is your fundamental outlook unchanged for 4Q or is there a change\u2026 Mike Hansen : Yeah. I apologize. No, as Todd talked about, our market remains very large, the momentum in the business remains good, the adoption remains good, and the guide for the fourth quarter is right where we want to be in terms of sort of the stated profile of growth that we want to have. And so, all of that put together with not really any change in customer behavior would mean, no, continued performance like we've seen, and we continue to like the momentum of the business. As it relates to your second question, the 60 basis points, that was not contemplated in the initial guide from the beginning of the year and that was simply absorbed through -- well, in this third quarter, the 60 basis points simply absorbed. Andy Wittmann : Okay, thank you. That's all my questions for today. Operator : And our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, George. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Can you provide an update on the external selling environment, including how client budgets and sales cycles are performing? Todd Schneider : Yeah, I'm certainly happy to start. George, good morning. We haven't really seen much of a change in sales cycle as far as our -- the interest in our products and services remains good. We're always continuing -- we're continuing to invest in new products and services. Tweaks, I guess, certainly to them to make it as attractive to the prospects and the customers as possible. But we're not seeing a change. Momentum continues to be good. Outsourcing still resonates and we're seeing, as I mentioned earlier, the no program market is still really, really large. And we've become pretty darn proficient at presenting to those prospects to help them run a better business. And we help them with all the products and services we provide. And as I mentioned, it's not always new money. Usually they're spending something. It's just redirecting it to us to do it better, faster, smarter, cheaper type thing. George Tong : Got it. That's helpful. And then separately, can you talk a little bit about your focus verticals, including healthcare, how much additional runway is there for these focus verticals to serve as a tailwind to organic revenue growth? Todd Schneider : Yeah. So, George, so it's in our internal growth. So it is helping us -- that focus is helping us to organize around the customer and provide the products and services that they want. And that has been a good strategy for us over the past number of years. So we like all the verticals we're in. We find them very attractive. Whether it's healthcare, hospitality, education, state, local government, business, it's all attractive and we're organized around it and our value proposition is resonating with them. Operator : And our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please go ahead, Tim. Luke McFadden : Hi, good morning. This is Luke McFadden on for Tim Mulrooney. Thanks for taking our questions today. So I wanted to ask, too, just on first date, I'll start with the first one and then move on to the second one after. But First Aid and Safety has been growing at a double digit rate for quite a few quarters in a row now. I know there's a penetration story here with your established base of uniform customers, but I'm also curious if new product introductions are an important driver of this growth. How much of your growth in that segment is from new product introductions? Todd Schneider : Good morning, Luke. We really like the First Aid business. Part of our culture is continued innovation. So we're always looking at improving our -- improving our processes, improving our products, improving our services, so it's always a component. I cannot give you a number of, hey, it was X basis points of growth due to a product rollout or what have you, but I can tell you this. The value proposition in the First Aid business and all of our businesses, but in First Aid, as you asked about, it's really resonating. And the mix of business that we have there is really good. And we're able to be better sourcers, better providers of products with our investment and our distribution center. So when you have a robust supply chain that allows us to get products to the customers in a really timely fashion, it puts us in a great spot to be successful. And so yeah, cross-sell, we're absolutely, we want all of our customers, whether they're uniform or fire or direct sale customer, we want them all to know about our First Aid business. And we try to make sure that that occurs in many different conduits, but it's, yeah, we're benefiting from that cross-sell. Luke McFadden : Understood, really helpful, and maybe just sticking on first aid and safety here. As you think about that segment of your business, does it feel like you've essentially built out the full suite of products and services there, or at some point should we expect that potentially you're more about other product introductions as you continue to build out the portfolio? Because the room here for more is essentially what I'm curious to know. Todd Schneider : Yeah, Luke, yeah, again, I'll go back to our culture. Our culture is such that we are constantly innovating and pushing ourselves to be the -- to provide the best products and services. And so you'll see more of that to come. We're constantly innovating to put our partners in the best position, our employee partners in the best position to provide the most value for our customers. Mike Hansen : And maybe one added comment Luke, when we think about this business, you may have heard us speak to umbrellas of image, safety, cleanliness and compliance and when we think about this business, safety is a fairly large umbrella and when our first aid and safety people are speaking with customers and thinking about that innovation that Todd talked about, we're thinking quite broadly about how do we keep our customers, how do we help our customers keep their employees safe. And that can mean opportunities into the future. And that's the way we look at it from a broad perspective. Operator : And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan Securities. Please go ahead, Andrew. Andrew Steinerman : Hi. In the quarter, when you look at your rentals and facility services segment, how much of the growth is actually coming from uniforms versus ancillary services directionally? Like, is there good growth in both? And also if you can make a comment about ad stops within uniforms. Todd Schneider : Good morning, Andrew. As you know, we don't give out those specific numbers, but directionally to your question, yeah, we're seeing growth across them at all. It's -- there's good demand for our uniform business and our facility services business, frankly for all of our business products and services. So, nothing to point out to one particular area there. As far as ad stops, we haven't really seen a change to our customer behavior there. So, it\u2019s -- I'll call it kind of business as usual. There's many inputs to that number, but nevertheless, I'd say it's kind of business as usual. Andrew Steinerman : Thank you. Todd Schneider : Yes, sir. Operator : And our next question comes from Jasper Bibb from Truist Securities. Please go ahead, Jasper. Jasper Bibb : Hey, good morning, guys. I wanted to follow up on the earlier discussion on first aid. The gross margin there was really impressive at 56% this quarter, but you also had SG&A at 25% from the prior year. So, could you provide just maybe a bit of color on the investments you're making in that business? And when do you think the first aid segment should start to deliver a bit more margin leverage over that G&A base? Todd Schneider : Yeah, Jasper, good morning. As I mentioned, we really like the business and it's performing really well and we're investing appropriately. The amount of prospects out there are massive. And to Mike's point earlier, the value proposition is resonating. We talk about the mantra in that business is what's more important to a business than the health and safety of their employees and their customers. So that is resonating. We're in a great position to invest to provide those products and services. So we're doing just that. And so we're investing in selling resources, we're investing in marketing resources, because we really like where we are and it makes sense to invest. And I think you're seeing it show up in the operating margin and the gross margin. Mike Hansen : Yeah, we've -- each quarter this year has been 22% or higher, which is quite a big improvement from a year ago. And so, as Todd said, these -- and we want to continue to invest in the long-term growth of all of our businesses. And you can really see those investments playing out, particularly in the gross margin line of first aid and safety. But we love the margins. They're up quite a bit over the last few years. And we'll continue to invest as we see appropriate. Jasper Bibb : Thanks, that makes sense. And then just was hoping to get an update on what you're seeing for expense growth on labor and fleet related costs in the quarter? Todd Schneider : Jasper, good question. Certainly, labor is an important component. We want to make sure that we're providing attractive wages, competitive wages. And we've spoken on previous calls that we were not flat-footed when it came to the wage inflation that I'd say North America has seen over the past few years. So we've been in a good position and we like where we are from that perspective. And here's what's really exciting, is we have, I mentioned earlier, our Six Sigma teams, our engineering teams, they're helping us to automate certain items to bring transformation technology to portions of our business, whether it's SmartTruck or plant efficiencies, that allows us to mitigate that subject as best as possible. And so we're investing and have invested for years in those organizations and it's paying off in -- and what we're seeing with our total labor costs as we manage through and make sure we're still in a really good spot to be a competitive and attract the very best people. Operator : And our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra from RBC. Please go ahead, Ashish. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to focus on the Google partnership. I was wondering if you can provide an update on that front. I believe you've already migrated your SAP onto the GCP. And how should we think about those benefits that you may have seen in the quarter, but also benefits as we go forward? Thanks. Todd Schneider : Good question, Ashish. I would characterize -- well, first off, we have a great relationship with Google. You're correct, we did migrate to the Google Cloud platform and I would characterize it as we're in the early innings there. And so we certainly hope to maximize our relationship and put our employee partners in a position to provide more value and to be as successful as possible. Because we believe there's tools that will be available to us to provide more value to the customers and to put our people in a better position to provide that value which makes them more successful. So early innings, but we're optimistic about where that can go. Ashish Sabadra : That's a very helpful color. And if I can ask a quick accounting clarifying question. So in the balance sheet, the uniform and other rental items and service that's moderated sequentially quarter to quarter, I was just wondering if you can provide any color on what's driving that, is that better efficiency or any color on that front? Thanks. Mike Hansen : Yes. Todd talked a little bit about how we are working on all pieces of the business, but certainly one of those is inventory, and he touched on a little bit of garment sharing. So you can think about when we improve garment sharing, for example, we don't need to inject as many new garments into that in-service inventory. So the more sharing means better utilization of our existing in-service inventory, and it means we don't have to add as much into the in-service inventory from new purchases. That's one of the areas. Certainly, though, there are others like improved sourcing as well. Volume growth, as Todd said, remains really strong, and so what we're seeing is some nice offsetting of the volume growth with some of these initiatives. Operator : And our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Please go ahead, Stephanie. Stephanie Moore : Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to continue the discussion on the pretty impressive margin front for the quarter. I appreciate the color in terms of kind of discussing the route optimization, the merchandise management, Six Sigma, the likes. But maybe if you could provide a little bit of color of your major initiatives, which ones you think are kind of still in the early innings, or we could kind of continue to see some more improvement or accelerated improvement? And then maybe taking it a step further, what is next for you guys, in terms of other areas of opportunity that haven't been as major focused yet? Thank you. Todd Schneider : Good morning, Stephanie. From our strategic initiatives that we're focused on how can we impact our business in total, certainly our material costs, our energy, our labor. And Mike referred to earlier, our energy spend is down 40 basis points. That's not all just price. That is, those initiatives that we referred to earlier, the material cost is -- our two largest costs are material costs and labor. So we're very focused on driving efficiencies in all those areas, because to Mike's earlier point, we love the volume growth, but we don't want to sacrifice margin because the volume growth is so robust that we've got these strategic initiatives to extract these inefficiencies out of our business. And I wouldn't speak to any one in particular that it's in the earlier innings or the others. We've got a nice runway forward for doing that. A little bit of that is our culture, is that we're constantly trying to innovate and push ourselves to be better. So I think you'll see that continued. As far as acceleration, it's built in. We're constantly doing it. So I think we're focused on those incremental margins and this is an important component of making sure that we can hit those numbers. Mike Hansen : Yeah, the only thing I might add is we're certainly in the very early innings of technology and we believe there's a nice runway there. Todd talked about just the recent migration to the Google Cloud and that creates a foundation for us to do some interesting things moving forward. Stephanie Moore : Great. Well, thank you so much. Operator : And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, Scott. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning, it's [Daniel] (ph) on for Scott. Thanks for taking our question. Could you please speak to the outlook for uniform direct sales and fire protection as well as some perspective on the margins for all others going forward please? Thank you. Todd Schneider : I'll start on the outlook and, Mike, if you want to speak to the margins. The uniform direct sale business is strategic business for us. We have some really large strategic accounts, whether it's national accounts or in the hospitality, gaming area of our business. And so strategic meaning that those customers spend a lot more money with us not just with garment direct sale but also outside of that. So that's important. That being said, that business certainly can be a little lumpy due to the nature of it with rollouts and purchases. But we like where we're positioned there. We like the value proposition that we're -- where we are there. So we think the outlook's very positive there. As far as the fire business, it's been a great business for us. The results over the last several years, we've seen great revenue growth, we've seen great margin improvement, and it's the only business we're in where you legally have to have those products and services. So we think it\u2019s -- the outlook is really positive because of the prospects that are out there and the runway we see for opportunity. So, Mike, if you want to comment on margin. Mike Hansen : Sure. So as Todd said, the fire business in particular, the margins have increased quite a bit in the last handful of years, and we've seen a lot of the same initiatives and other initiatives specific to that business really take off like we've seen in our other businesses. The one thing I might point out there, we did see some increase in SG&A and the fire business year-over-year, and we're starting to get into that SAP implementation for the fire business. So we might see a little bit of pressure as we move into fiscal \u201825 on the fire margins, the overall margins because of that investment and that move. But as you've seen with our rental and first aid and safety businesses, once we understand how to use that and get proficient at it, it can create some really nice opportunities. So maybe a little bit of -- we've seen some great improvement, maybe a little bit of next year and the following year pressure on SG&A because of that implementation, but we certainly expect those margins to continue to improve in the longer term. From a uniform direct sale margin perspective, as Todd said, that business is going to go up and down. It's going to be a little bit bumpy from quarter to quarter. And because of that, the margins will be as well. So I don't think there's anything specific to call out other than it isn't quite as consistent of a business as the other three that we have. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead Shlomo. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Hey, Todd, can you talk a little bit about the macro environment with regard to employment? And specifically if you could touch up on some of the areas where they're looking for more automation to reduce the employment due to raises in minimum wage in areas like California, are you -- how exposed are you to those kind of verticals? And then after that, I have a follow up. Todd Schneider : Good morning, Shlomo. Yeah, from a macro environment, as I mentioned, we haven't seen much change in our customer behavior. Certainly there is always some puts and takes. And as you mentioned, our employer is under pressure to figure out ways to automate things because wage inflation, that has occurred and will continue to occur, it's occurred for many, many years. Now there's also some -- the infrastructure bills that are out there, the on-shoring. I can't speak to specifics of, oh, boy, we're benefiting from this or this is a headwind here. But generally, we like the spot we're in. And we think it's, the macro environment where it's been reasonably stable and that's -- we find that attractive and we can be really successful in that environment. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay, thank you. Just for a follow-up, you have a competitor there that was spun out, say, six months ago. And I was just wondering, has there been any change in the environment with them competitively in terms, either positively or negatively? I mean, have you seen any changes in the way that they bid? Are you taking more business from them? Maybe you could just comment in general. Todd Schneider : Yeah, Shlomo, I would characterize it as, it's pretty well business as usual. They're a very good competitor, always have been, I'm sure they always will be, and we have a great deal of respect for them. And it's a very competitive environment, always has been as far as -- as long as I've been with the company, it has been, and I'm sure it will be in the future and -- but we're focused on putting our employee partners in the best position to be successful in providing our customers the best value proposition. So really none of that has changed. Operator : And our next question comes from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Please go ahead, Kartik. Kartik Mehta : Yeah, thank you. Hey, good morning. Todd, you have been able to execute extremely well this year, beat guidance. And as you look at the business, is that the result of maybe metrics like non-programmers being a little bit better than you thought? Is it sales being better than you thought? Maybe you're just more cautious about the economy than actually happened. If you look at why you have been able to do better, what would you point to? Todd Schneider : Yeah, Kartik, it starts with our culture and our expectations of our employee partners and the pace and the intensity of which they run. But that being said, we\u2019ve -- our value proposition is really resonating in each of the businesses we're in. The first aid business we spoke about, it's very good. Outsourcing is resonating nicely. Maybe it has to do with, it's not as easy to hire people as it has been in the past, so if you want someone to outsource it, it's that much more attractive. Yeah, we like the spot we're in, and it\u2019s -- and we have exceeded our internal expectations, and we're pleased with that. But there's so many inputs to it, because we're trying to focus on providing better products, better services, better technologies to make our people more successful and to make our customers that much happier. So a lot of inputs but we like where we're positioned and we're continuing to invest for the future. Kartik Mehta : And just one follow-up, you obviously discussed M&A a lot. I'm wondering, and I know some of these acquisitions can take years to come to fruition. But as you look at the market today, are you seeing any change in the pricing environment, maybe what expectations are from sellers, or has it remained about the same? Todd Schneider : Yeah, Kartik, good question. I wouldn't speak to any change there. It's more about -- certain events might cause them, whether it's an owner's age or succession or -- there's many different life events that would cause them to make a move. And it's more about that to your point. It's in certain cases, these are decades in the making. And you can't really pace them, but when they are ready, we're ready. And we're highly acquisitive, very interested in M&A from all shapes and sizes, big, little, medium, everything in between, we think it\u2019s -- we're very interested. Operator : And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Toni. Toni Kaplan : Thanks so much. I wanted to ask a question on the focus verticals. Are you able to share sort of the growth between focus verticals versus non-focus ones? And how do you assess whether to add a new vertical into that sort of focus designation? Is there a different go-to-market strategy for focus verticals as well? Thanks. Todd Schneider : Yeah, good morning, Toni. Well, I'll say this about our focus verticals. I certainly expect them to grow faster than the business in general. And when you have an organized approach and you're organized around a customer base, you certainly expect that. And we've chosen what we think are really good verticals that are very attractive. So yeah, I can't give you a specific of -- boy, it's adding X amount of basis points to our total growth, but we think we've chosen well. And we're always analyzing what's -- should we have another one or should we not? And what's the best way? And it really gets down to what puts our employee partners in the best position to be successful and what creates the most value for the customer base. So we're looking, we're evaluating, always doing that, but we like where our investment is at this point. Toni Kaplan : Terrific. I wanted to also ask about your marketing budget and whether you've increased that year-over-year. I recently heard some Cintas commercials on Bloomberg Radio for example, just wondering if that's coincidence or if there's been a greater push towards more marketing? Thanks. Todd Schneider : Yeah, Toni, first off, thank you. I'm glad to hear that. The algorithm is working and it's hitting our target audience. So I wouldn't say there's been a step change there. It's just trying to be -- make sure our investment is well-placed. And we're trying to leverage analytics and technology to make sure that the investment is deriving the very best ROI as possible. So it's just a matter of tweaks versus a step change in investment. Toni Kaplan : Terrific. Thanks a lot. Todd Schneider : Thank you. Operator : And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jared for closing remarks. Jared Mattingley : Thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our fourth quarter of fiscal \u201824 financial results in July. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Todd Schneider : Thank you, Jared. Our fourth quarter performance marked a strong finish to another successful year for Cintas. Fourth quarter total revenue grew 8.2% to $2.47 billion, an all-time high for revenue in a quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 7.5%. And importantly, each of our businesses continue to perform well and execute at a high level. Fourth quarter gross margin was $1.22 billion, an increase of 11.6% over the prior year. Gross margin increased 150 basis points from 47.7% to 49.2%. Operating income for the fourth quarter of $547.6 million increased 16.3% over the prior year. Operating margin increased 160 basis points to 22.2% from 20.6% in the prior year. Fourth quarter net income was $414.3 million, an increase of 19.7%. Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter were $3.99, an increase of 19.8% over the prior year fourth quarter. These results conclude a strong fiscal year marked by significant accomplishments, including robust revenue growth and margin expansion and excellent cash generation, which continue to fuel our balanced capital allocation strategy. The following are specific highlights of fiscal '24. I'd like to begin with revenue. Fiscal year revenue was a record $9.6 billion, an increase of 8.9%. Organic growth was 8% for the year. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment exceeded $1 billion in annual revenue for the first time. Our top line growth is a function of the total value proposition we offer customers of all sizes and across industries and unique Cintas culture that drives our partners to deliver an outstanding customer experience. Business across our focused verticals of health care, hospitality, education, and state and local government continue to perform well. We experienced strong demand for our services not only from existing customers but across our new business pipeline. About two-third of our new customers continue to come from no-programmers, underscoring our ability to capitalize on the vast growth opportunity that remains ahead. In addition, our retention rates remain strong. Our strong revenue performance also translated into continued growth in profits and earnings, including the following highlights. Fiscal '24 operating income grew 14.8% for the year, and our operating margin of 21.6% was an all-time high. EPS grew 16.6% for the year. Our enhanced profitability and earnings growth is a reflection of our relentless focus on operational excellence in every aspect of our business, spanning strategic sourcing and supply chain initiatives, route and energy optimization opportunities with SmartTruck, and leveraging the SAP system to support greater stockroom visibility and efficient garment sharing. Our cash flow from operating activities exceeded $2 billion for the first time. Strong cash generation provides us even greater flexibility to deploy capital across each of our capital allocation priorities throughout the year. Our number one capital allocation priority is investing back in the business. We prioritize investments in technology, infrastructure, and people to support our sustained growth and value creation over the long term. As we continue to grow and create value, capital is required to add capacity in a number of ways, including new facilities, new equipment, new vehicles as well as technologies to make our partners more successful. We spent $186.8 million in fiscal '24 on acquisitions. This is the most we've spent on acquisitions since fiscal '17. We love acquisitions as they provide us with new customers where we can offer a broader range of products and services. Sometimes they can bring needed capacity that can also bring attractive synergies that involve leveraging our existing route structures, providing more time with customers and less time driving. Another of our priorities is returning capital to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. In fiscal '24, we increased our quarterly per share dividend by 17.4%, marking the 40th consecutive year that we've increased our dividend, including every year since going public. We also bought back $1 billion of shares during fiscal '24 and up through yesterday. Lastly, we were named to the prestigious Fortune 500 for the eighth consecutive year. It is an honor to be recognized among the most successful and respected companies. We're proud of these results and the value we continue to deliver for the Cintas shareholders. That performance reflects the focus and great execution by our employees whom we call partners. I'll now turn the call over to Mike to provide details of our fourth quarter results. Mike Hansen : Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal '24 fourth quarter revenue was $2.47 billion compared to $2.28 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 7.5%. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.22 billion compared to $1.09 billion last year, an increase of 11.6%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 49.2% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 47.7% last year, an increase of 150 basis points. Strong growth from new customers and the penetration of existing customers with more products and services helped generate great operating leverage, aided by the performance of our global supply chain and focused efforts to extract inefficiencies from the business via our Six Sigma engineering teams as well as technologies like SmartTruck. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.91 billion compared to $1.77 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 7.1%. As we have done in the past, I will share revenue mix of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment for the fourth quarter. Keep in mind, there can be small fluctuations in mix between quarters. Uniform rental was 48%; dust was 19%; hygiene was 16%; shop towels were 4%; linen, which includes microfiber, wipes, towels and aprons, was 10%; and catalog revenue was 3%. These percentages are consistent with last year and demonstrate we are experiencing strong demand across all our products and services. Gross margin for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 48.6% compared to 47.7% last year. This 90 basis point improvement was the result of good top line growth that continue to generate great operating leverage and excellent sourcing and process improvements, which continue to create additional efficiencies such as garment sharing and SmartTruck. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the fourth quarter was $277.6 million compared to $249.8 million last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 11.1%, capping off another year of double-digit organic growth. Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment was 55.4% compared to 51% last year. This 440 basis point improvement was a result of our double-digit revenue growth that created solid operating leverage, an improved sales mix, a dedicated first aid distribution center that has lowered costs as well as efficiencies from our SmartTruck technology. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $282.1 million compared to $261.5 million last year. The Fire Protection revenue was $197.9 million, and the organic revenue growth rate was 12.9%, resulting in another year of double-digit organic growth. The Uniform Direct Sale revenue was $84.2 million, and organic revenue decreased 4.4%. The organic growth rate in Uniform Direct Sales can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Gross margin for Fire Protection Services was an all-time high of 50% compared to 47.9% last year. This 210 basis point improvement was primarily the result of robust revenue growth that generated strong operating leverage along with route productivity improvements. Gross margin for Uniform Direct Sales was 40.9% compared to 36% last year. This 490 basis point improvement was the result of higher margin accounts from a disciplined approach to the market. Fourth quarter selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue was 27%, which was a 10 basis point improvement from last year. We were able to create leverage with these costs while continuing to invest in technology and selling resources. Fourth quarter operating income was $547.6 million compared to $470.8 million last year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue was 22.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 20.6% in last year's fourth quarter. The fourth quarter marks the first time that all three operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services, and Fire Protection Services exceeded 22% in operating income in the same quarter. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 21.4% compared to 22.4% last year. Net income for the fourth quarter was $414.3 million compared to $346.2 million last year. This year's fourth quarter diluted EPS was $3.99 compared to $3.33 last year, an increase of 19.8%. I'll now turn the call back over to Todd to provide his thoughts on next year and our financial expectations for fiscal '25. Todd Schneider : Thank you, Mike. As we move into fiscal '25, we expect to exceed $10 billion in annual revenue for the first time. This outlook, coupled with our strong fiscal '24 results, demonstrate that our value proposition continues to resonate. Every business in North America, goods-producing or services-providing, has a need for image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance. We help our customers meet those needs so they can focus on running their businesses. As we deliver on our customers' needs, our culture remains our greatest competitive advantage, and it drives our focus on continuous improvement and evolving for the future. We will continue to prioritize investments in technology, infrastructure, and people. Our technology investments include our continued investment in SAP with our Fire division currently going through the implementation process. In addition to SAP, we have partnered with Verizon and Google to deploy technology solutions that make it easier for our partners to run their business and easier for our customers to do business with us. In addition, technology initiatives such as SmartTruck and garment sharing are helping to drive customer satisfaction as well as efficiencies throughout the organization. Our working partners really are the key to our success. We know that when we take care of our partners, they will, in turn, take great care of our customers. We are investing in training our partners and giving them the best and latest tools to make their jobs easier while also investing in talent acquisition in order to ensure we are properly staffed to support our growth initiatives. The future of Cintas remains bright, and our fiscal '25 guidance reflects that outlook. For fiscal '25, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $10.16 billion to $10.31 billion, a total growth rate of 5.9% to 7.4%. Please note the following : fiscal '25 will have two fewer workdays compared to fiscal '24. Each quarter of fiscal '25 will have 65 workdays. The two fewer workdays will impact the first and fourth quarters by one day each. The revenue growth rate in each of those two quarters will be negatively affected by about 160 basis points. Please keep that in mind when modeling. Adjusting for the impact of two fewer workdays, acquisitions already completed and at constant currency, our total organic growth rate for next year is expected to be 6.4% to 8%. We expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $16.25 to $16.75, a growth rate of 7.3% to 10.6%. Fiscal '25 net interest expense is expected to be approximately $106 million compared to $95 million in fiscal '24, predominantly as a result of higher variable rate debt used to complete a portion of the previously mentioned share buybacks. Our fiscal '25 effective tax rate is expected to be 20.4%, the same compared to our fiscal '24. Guidance does not include any future share buybacks or significant economic disruptions or downturns. I want to end by thanking our partners for their tremendous efforts to achieve a successful fiscal '24. As we look ahead to fiscal '25, our outlook reflects our continued confidence in our strategy. We remain focused on delivering outstanding customer experiences, reinforcing the unique Cintas culture that drives our success while making the necessary investments in the business to sustain our growth through fiscal '25 and long beyond. I'll now turn the call back over to Jared. Jared Mattingley : That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Joshua Chan from UBS. Please go ahead, Joshua. Joshua Chan : Congrats on a strong quarter. I was wondering if you guys could comment on your retention rates. I know that you've said it's generally stable. Have you seen any slight uptick in industry churn or downtick in retention, I guess? How are you seeing your customers behave in this environment? Todd Schneider : Thanks for your comments. We really haven't seen a change in our customer behavior. As I mentioned, our retention rates are still at very attractive levels. And when you have as broad of a customer base as we do, there are certainly some aspects that are doing -- that are thriving and some that are struggling. It varies based upon industry. It varies based upon geography. But when you speak as a whole, I would say our customer base is -- we haven't seen much change in it so far. Joshua Chan : That's great to hear. And then for my follow-up, could you just kind of talk about your reasoning behind choosing the 6.4% to 8.0% organic growth for next year? I guess in the context of just doing 7.5% in Q4, what are the scenarios that would lead you to the bottom and the top end of the growth range? Todd Schneider : Well, Josh, we really like where we -- our guide is. We like where our business is. And that's where we -- that's kind of where we target our business to grow at those types of levels. Certainly, we read the overall macro data that we -- that you all read about what's going on in the economy. So, we watch that. But we don't expect much change at this point. And as a result, I'd say we expect to be right in that guide. We'd love for the economy to go even faster. But nevertheless, we find ways to be successful. Our value proposition is resonating. We have -- we service a little over 1 million customers or 16 million businesses in our market, and we have all kinds of ways to grow. And I think we've shown that we have the ability to exceed GDP growth and exceed employment growth. So, we would certainly love for our customers to be thriving and adding people all over the place. But nevertheless, we're going to find a way to be successful and we're confident in our guide. Operator : And our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please go ahead, Heather. Heather Balsky : Can you just kind of update us on how you're thinking about incremental margins and how you're thinking about the margin story for 2025? What are the bigger tailwinds? What are you most excited about? And anything going on in the cost environment as well? Todd Schneider : Well, I'll start, Heather. As we think about margin expansion, and our guide reflects margin expansion with the first item we think about as it comes to that is leverage, leverage on revenue growth. And we've demonstrated that we have the ability to do that, and we'll continue to do that. And that's easy to say, hard to do, but the team has done an incredible job in so many areas, starting with our global supply chain, which is a competitive advantage in the marketplace. How they go about their jobs, the fact that they have dual source or many sources for 90% or more of the products that we source, so how they go about that. The great work that's been done on material costs, again, starting with sourcing. But also, we leverage our SAP system to help us to improve our garment sharing. And we've been working on this for years and it's bearing fruit not only in our cost structure but also in turnaround time for our customers. So, it helps us to get product to our customers faster when it's in our stockrooms versus having to order new out of our distribution centers. Better for our customers, better for our financials, and that's paying off for us. Operator : And our next question comes from Andy Wittmann from R.W. Baird. Please go ahead, Andy. Andy Wittmann : I just thought I would start with the competitive environment. Both of your largest competitors have noted increased competition out there. And I know that your product and service offering is a little bit broader. But I thought just given those competitor comments, I would take your temperature and have you comment, if you could, please, on what you're seeing out there in the competitive environment. Todd Schneider : Andy, here's what I'll tell you is that we operate in a highly competitive market. Always have, always will. I'm sure. I've been with the Company for 35 years. It's been competitive every day since I've been here. Now that being said, our revenue retention rates, as I mentioned, are attractive. And part of it is because our new business wins tend to come from the no-program market and less from the competition. So, as I mentioned earlier, there's 16 million businesses out there. We service about 1 million. So, the white space out there is incredible. And we're focused on converting those folks from, I'll call it, a do-it-yourself type to a customer of ours. And that value proposition is resonating because we help them focus on taking care of their customers or their patients or their guests or whatever, however you want to describe it, and we take that for them. And we're able to do it better, faster, smarter and, in many cases, cheaper than what they were doing it. So yes, is it competitive? Heck yes. It's always been competitive and we're focused on growing the market and that's been a good model for us. Andy Wittmann : I appreciate that. And then I guess, maybe Mike, I guess I wanted to kind of ask some of the margin questions in a little bit different way. First, as I was just kind of doing the math between the EPS and the revenue, I was getting somewhere around 20 or 30 basis points of implied operating margin expansion for the year. So maybe you could just clarify that. But that's a pretty decent deceleration from the amount of margin expansion certainly you saw in the quarter or even over the course of the past fiscal year. So, I was just wondering if you could comment on if there's anything, any categories inside the P&L that we should be aware of that are inflating more materially, or if there's other areas, maybe energy costs, I don't know, that we should be aware of that could be weighing on continued margin expansion like we've seen here in recent quarters. Mike Hansen : Andy, the short answer to are there any new headwinds, the short answer is no, with the exception of maybe the two fewer workdays where as you've heard us talk about, for example, in the first quarter, we talked a little bit about the top line impact being 160 basis points of growth headwind. But also, you've also heard us talk about margins. When we lose a workday, we've generally talked about a 50 basis point impact. We lose two workdays next year. We've done such a good job of leveraging our infrastructure that the loss of a workday in a quarter is probably more like 30 to 40 basis points now. But we lose two workdays, and so there'll be a little bit of headwind from that. That is just sort of a product of the calendar and not necessarily the business. Having said that, the business is still operating really well. And if you think about the -- we think about the guidance range is generally in the, you can call it, the 25% to 35% incremental margin range. And so, it is a pretty good margin range of the 30 basis points that you referred to, Andy. We would kind of say, look at the very bottom. There still is margin expansion at the very bottom of our range. At the top of the range, there's more than 30 basis points, probably more like 70 basis points. So, the year, we think this is a typical guide range for us. As you saw in our fourth quarter, the initiatives and the operational excellence that we have worked so hard on have continued in the fourth quarter. And given this guide, we expect those to continue into fiscal '25. Operator : And our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, George. George Tong : Can you talk a bit about the progress you're making with penetrating your high-growth focused verticals, including health care, hospitality, education, and government? Where are you seeing particularly good traction? Todd Schneider : Yes, we really like the verticals that we've chosen. And as a reminder, it's not just a sales strategy. It is also how we organize around those customers, those industries, those verticals to make sure that we're meeting, exceeding their needs because they're a little different. And as we do that, the products, the services that we provide, the support that we provide all comes along with that. And so yes, they're all operating at attractive levels. And I wouldn't call anyone out specifically where I'd say, oh my gosh, that one's exceeding. They're all doing quite well. I thought it might be helpful to talk a little bit about a recent health care win that we had. We recently sold a large hospital network with scrub dispensing technology for the scrubs in the various departments throughout an acute care hospital. But we're also having really good success with surgery centers and those types that are attached to the large acute care hospital networks. And you're probably seeing some of that acute care hospital networks having investments in other areas. So, in fact, I'd say three large health care systems came to us for help with their non-acute facilities. When I say non-acute facilities, I'm talking about really surgery centers, clinics, physician offices, those types. And they came to us and said, \"You're doing a great job for acute care. Can you help us with the non-acute?\" And what does that do for them? It allows them to have a consistent supply but also allows them to consolidate vendors. So, we're seeing good success certainly in health care. But the other verticals are all performing well. And we like the decisions, the investments that we've made in those areas, and we think they're going to continue to pay dividends for us. Operator : And our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please go ahead, Tim. Tim Mulrooney : Just one from me, and I hopped on late so apologies if this has been addressed, but a few of your competitors have recently cited more pricing pushback and an increasing number of customers putting their contracts out to bid. I'm wondering on this pricing idea if you're seeing a similar dynamic where customers are becoming more price sensitive in this environment. Or do you think that this is less of an issue for the industry overall and could perhaps be more specific to these individual companies or markets? Todd Schneider : So, I'd say nothing to call out specifically there. It's still really a normal operating environment. As I mentioned earlier, we operate in a highly competitive market. So, we've got to make sure that we're -- our value proposition is resonating with our customers and we're providing outstanding customer service. We've said that our plan is to lower pricing back towards historical levels and that's what we're seeing. And I would just point out that as we've moderated pricing, even in fiscal '24, we were able to expand operating margins 120 basis points. And so, we're finding ways to provide great value for our customers while moderating pricing but still extracting inefficiencies out of our business so that we can improve operating margins. Tim Mulrooney : Okay, so not really seeing pushback on pricing. And Todd, would you say it certainly is not lost on us that you had strong incrementals this quarter as pricing moderated. Would you say now pricing has fully normalized? That there is no more headwinds as we head into 2025 from moderating pricing? Or is that -- are you still in that process? Todd Schneider : Tim, we've -- as I mentioned, it's a highly competitive market. We have continued to moderate pricing. And pricing is a local subject. It really depends upon the customers, what their operating environment's like, what their customer base is doing, those types. So, we continue to monitor that and manage it appropriately based upon our local businesses and making sure that we're meeting our customers' needs and thinking about the long-term value of a customer because we don't look at it and say, we're focused on the near term or in the short term. We're focused on the long term for our customers, and we'll continue to manage pricing in that manner. Mike Hansen : And I might just add, Tim, to your question, probably not a lot of fiscal '25 to fiscal '24 year-over-year pricing change. Operator : And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, Andrew. Andrew Steinerman : If you could believe it, I'm just going to ask you to clarify something you just said. So, you talked about moderating pricing. When I hear the words moderating pricing, I hear price decreases. I assume what you mean is you're moderating to a more normal type of modest price increase. And then when talking about fiscal '25, are you talking about modest price increases or really flat pricing year-over-year for existing customers? Todd Schneider : Just to clarify, moderating pricing is the way you characterized it, which is we are passing through modest price increases based upon our agreement and relationship with that customer. And that varies based upon customers, geographies, industries, et cetera. But yes, the way you described it is appropriate. It's a modest price increase with customers in general. Andrew Steinerman : That's true for the fiscal '25, too, right? Todd Schneider : That would be correct. Andrew Steinerman : Good clarification. Operator : And our next question comes from Jasper Bibb from Truist Securities. Please go ahead, Bibb. Jasper Bibb : Was hoping you could give a bit more color on what you're seeing as far as net headcount at customers or their hiring posture and any expectations there embedded in your fiscal '25 organic growth guidance. Todd Schneider : Yes, it really varies. As I mentioned, we have such a broad customer base in geographies but really not much change in customer behavior when it comes to hiring. We're seeing a pretty -- the environment is, I'll call it, stable and hasn't really changed much in the past few quarters. Jasper Bibb : Got it. Last one for me. Maybe asking an earlier question a little bit differently. With this whole dynamic of peers talking about increased churn, including at some of the larger national accounts, if you're not seeing a pricing or retention hit, are you potentially taking away some of this competitor business at a higher rate, given these market dynamics? Todd Schneider : Well, here's the way I'd describe it is we operate in a really competitive environment. And so, we're out there trying to do the best to take care of our customers fighting for business every day. And I wouldn't characterize it as really much of a change in the environment. It's always really competitive. And we're continuing to try to position our organization with the best products, the best services, the best technology so that they can be successful in the marketplace. Operator : And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead, Manav. Manav Patnaik : I just had one question. Earlier, you talked about how you've been the most active in M&A for many years now. So just curious if you could just talk a little bit more about why now and perhaps what the pipeline in each of your segments looks like for future M&A? Todd Schneider : As you know, M&A, it's tough to predict. We think about it long term and make sure that we have relationships so that when someone does decide that they want to transact, that we're well positioned. So, it's really tough to predict deal flow. But again, we think about long term, and we want to be -- we find M&A really attractive and in large part because of, as I mentioned earlier, it gives us a new set of customers that we can offer a wider breadth of products and services that we offer. There can be highly attractive synergies. In many cases, we get some infrastructure that is important to us. And we always get great people and we learn from those. So yes, we're highly interested in M&A of all shapes and sizes and we're active in those markets. Tough to pace it. It takes two to dance. And we just want to make sure we're at the dance and ready. Operator : And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, Scott. Scott Schneeberger : The first one is just you've been speaking over the course of the year about investing in your selling capabilities, technology, management training. Just an update there. And also, you've been alluding a lot to myCintas portal. Any quantification you can put on that about penetration or anything else about how that's progressing? Todd Schneider : It's tough to put a number on that. It's kind of like, how do you put a value on the culture of Cintas? We're constantly reinvesting in those technologies, in those trainings to position our people to be more successful. We talk about making it easier for them to do their jobs and make it easier for our customers to do business with us. So those are all investments that are long-term thinking, long-term investments that positions our people to be successful in the marketplace. Some of those investments pay off faster but it's a continual investment. And when we think about those investments, it is -- we have an amazing team of partners that are out every day taking great care of the customers. We want to make it easier for them. And we want to make it -- give them data that allows them to provide more value to the customers, make it less laborious for them to do their jobs and allow customers the ability to self-serve and have many conduits to do business with Cintas and also communicate with Cintas. So, all those investments are ongoing and will be, frankly, probably ongoing in perpetuity because that's the nature of business now that technology plays a key role. And we're blessed to have a balance sheet where we can invest appropriately and position our team to be really successful. Scott Schneeberger : And the follow-up is, I just figured fiscal year-end and all-time high in the fourth quarter on the operating margin. So, kind of a conceptual longer-term question. You guys have done great since implementing the ERP and reaping benefits from it. What can you get to for peak margins? I mean, you've talked about incremental margins, 25%, 35% range. Can you get to 25% promptly? Can you get to 30% longer term? Just some consideration on what aspirational targets would be reasonable. Mike Hansen : Scott, I would say this, we don't like to put a ceiling on our aspirations, but we certainly think that we can continue to improve margins. And so maybe a couple of points. First of all, 25% to 35% incremental operating margins, we've got locations that are operating at the 30-plus level today. And so, we -- and that's in all of our businesses. And so, there is a pathway there and we are continuing to work on it. Sometimes it's better scale and density. Sometimes it's a little bit of product mix. Sometimes it's the newness of the location. But we have those examples, and we're continuing to get all of our locations closer and closer to those highest operating locations. And that incremental operating margin range of 25% to 35%, in our minds, tells us, certainly, we can work -- continue to work to get there. As you go back to the -- you've talked a little bit about technology. I would say that we're still in the early innings of technology. We've become much, much better at operating on the SAP system. And it's only been about four years since we've been -- since our rental business has been fully on and Fire is not on yet. And so, we have been getting better and better at using that system. But as you know, as we've talked about over the course of the last year or so, there are still a lot of things that can come with our Google and Verizon and SAP partnerships that we are just touching the surface on. And we think that can be a big driver of continued margin expansion into the future. Not ready to put a date on when we can hit 25% or 30%, but we certainly have that in our sights and we'll continue to work hard to get there. Operator : And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead, Shlomo. Adam Parrington : This is Adam on for Shlomo. Could you just maybe provide a little bit of outlook for Uniform Direct Sales and Fire Protection businesses for '25? And how much of a margin impact should there be in the Fire business from the SAP implementation you alluded to last quarter? Mike Hansen : From a Fire Protection business perspective, we're still in the implementation phase of that. And there's going to be a little bit of pressure on there. I'm not going to give a specific guidance in terms of their margin. But there'll be some pressure as we go through, keeping in mind when we go through an implementation, there is the work of the implementation, the work of training all of our people to use it, the inefficiencies that come along with that, and we will then get better and better. And fiscal '25 is going to be a little bit of a year of that training and implementation period. And so, I would say that's going to be a little bit of pressure on the margins there. Certainly, that's incorporated within our overall guide of margin improvement. From a Uniform Direct Sale perspective, our margins have been really good. We've been working on selling the right types of programs, and our Uniform Direct Sale partners are doing a great job in that area. But having said all of that, a little bit hard to tell based on that SAP implementation in Fire, but keeping in mind that's included with our overall guide. Operator : And our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, Ashish. Ashish Sabadra : Maybe just a question on the guidance philosophy because when we think about the organic growth in the quarter, still continues to be pretty robust compared to the industry growth profile at 7.5%, but it has moderated over the last eight quarters. The higher end of the guidance implies -- the 8% organic growth implies an inflection in growth. And historically, you've always set your guide where you have beaten and raised to guidance throughout the year. So, as we think about where do we really see the inflection? And in terms of guidance philosophy, when you say, is it equally conservative as we have seen in the prior years? Mike Hansen : Well, I'll say maybe this, Ashish. We had an 8% organic growth rate year this year, and that was a really good year in a year where, again, last year, we were at about 12.2% and 10% the previous year. And these were years where there was just heavy inflation. And as you know, our pricing was a little bit higher than norm. And we got the 8% this year in sort of that bringing the price increases back to something closer to historical levels. As we think about our guide, maybe I'll throw out a couple of numbers to you. And as Todd has been mentioning, we've had a -- we've not seen a lot of change in customer behavior. And we've had some really good performance in our full fiscal '24 year but I'll point out a couple. In our third quarter, if you adjust for the workdays, our total growth was 8.2%. In the fourth quarter, our total growth was 8.2%. In our guide, when you think about just simply the workday, our guide range is 6.7% to 8.3%. So, our guide range is effectively telling you we're seeing the business operate in much of the same manner as we saw in the second half of the year. If you look at the organic numbers in those -- in the third quarter, fourth quarter and next year, same story. And so, the philosophy is a little bit of, look, we have to build a bit of a range because we have to consider certain alternatives. But effectively, the guide range for fiscal '25 on the top line is right in line with what you've seen particularly in the second half of fiscal '24. And that is really nice growth in all of our businesses, certainly in Uniform Rental, First Aid and Safety, and Fire Protection. So hopefully, that helps a little bit, Ashish. Ashish Sabadra : Yes. No, that's very helpful color. Operator : And our next question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, Faiza. Faiza Alwy : So, you mentioned earlier in the call about the white space opportunity and just the traction you're getting with no-programmers. I think relative to historical levels, the contribution from no-programmers to growth has been higher. So, I'm curious if you can talk about what you're doing differently. Are you maybe using technology? Has the pit changed a little bit? Is there something about the underlying environment? So just curious on what's driving sort of incremental contribution from no-programmers. Todd Schneider : I'll start, and Mike, if you'd like to contribute. Faiza, good morning, and for several decades now, we have had a focus on trying to grow the pie of the business, and that white space is significant. So, we teach our organization about how to attract no-programmers. And it's a little different process. And it takes -- it's more of a conceptual sell versus something, I'll call it, more about -- well, you've got to coach them and teach them about how to do something different instead of simply doing it yourself. And again, that's a conceptual sell and we teach our folks on how to do that. And we happen to be blessed with being in a spot where there is a massive white space out there. And I'll say it's a harder concept to get across to people. But we've been doing it for so long that it's just part of how our organization operates. And we think that's exciting for us. No real obvious change I would point to. It's just part of our culture. It's part of how we teach and train our partners on how to approach that. And it resonates with people because they get the concept of outsourcing. They get the concept of, yes, maybe I am struggling to keep up with all this. And you can do it, you can do it better, faster, smarter, cheaper than I can. And that's been a key fundamental of how we've grown our business over the years and how we'll continue to grow our business into the future. Mike Hansen : Faiza, maybe I'll offer this a bit. If you think about the health care vertical that we've been in for maybe a decade or so now. When we got into that, we needed to create a sales team because it's just a different kind of sale, different kind of relationships. And so, we had to create a different kind of sales team. When we did that, we started with sort of maintenance uniforms, uniform rental and maintenance because we didn't have a broad product offering. As we continued in that business, we started to learn through dialogue with the customers how else we can help them, and we started things like microfiber and we started rental programs in microfiber. And that started to take off and has become a nice product for us. As we continued to have dialogue with them, that sort of evolved into then scrub rental programs. These came out of, again, dialogue with how can we help our customers. And so, this health care has grown from almost nothing to, call it, 8% of our revenue now. And it's largely because of the adaptation of our people to this new type of vertical, along with our dialogue with our customers and creating a real nice partnership, that then creates some innovation, that gets innovation flowing for us in new products and services. And then if we couple that with technology of having more information at our fingertips, of being able to find better prospecting. As we can better able to tell what customers have, which products and where might the warmest leads and so on be, over time, we have been able to grow the business and through that, grow the productivity. And so, all of these things that we do that Todd talks about, they don't happen overnight. They are the evolution and continued dialogue and collaboration with our customers to become more and more ingrained in what we do with them. And so, the -- you asked about the white space. This is just a continued evolution of that collaboration, innovation, technology wins, productivity improvement. Faiza Alwy : That's very helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on CapEx. You mentioned at the outset as a priority. I know we saw an increase in CapEx in 2024. And apologies if I missed it. I don't know if you gave a specific number, but just talk a bit more about some of the CapEx investments and how we should think about that going forward. Mike Hansen : We were about 4.3% in fiscal '24 as a percent of revenue. You might remember, we had a little bit of a catch-up in truck purchasing through the year. We had some of the SAP investment for Fire Protection. We largely believe that CapEx in the future is the 3.5% to 4% of revenue range. I think that's where we'll likely end up in fiscal '25. Operator : And our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Please go ahead, Stephanie. Stephanie Moore : I wanted to follow up actually on just the last question there and just one quick question. Are you finding potentially some increased activity from new customers that are viewing maybe a value proposition differently? So maybe taken another way, with higher inflationary environment, maybe not looking to kind of do it in-house and kind of have that initial capital outlay and your value proposition is coming in. Has that been a contributing driver to the growth? Todd Schneider : Yes, there's many inputs to it. Certainly, if you are with a rental uniform program, if you want to buy garments, there's a large capital outlay versus us doing that for the customer, and other areas where you might have to go buy dispensers for chemicals or soaps, towels, what have you, in restrooms. And we do that for the customer. We make that investment on their behalf. And then again, we free them up to take care of their business, focus on their people, their customers, their guests, their patients. So, I'm sure that contributes to it. Certainly, when it's -- I think we've benefited from the environment where people are busy, and whether they're trying to hire people, take care of customers and they say, again, wow, I didn't realize you could do that for me, you can do it at those competitive rates, and that frees me up. And over the years, we've spoken to many, many customers who were surprised that our average-sized customer, how small it is. And they didn't realize that they were big enough to have a service like ours, where our average-sized customer is really small. And that's part of our responsibilities to get the message out, that we can help customers and our sales team out there actively pursuing those. But I've seen that over and over again throughout the years. Stephanie Moore : Great. Got it. No, that's excellent color. Just last question for me. You talked about M&A being a bit more aggressive in this past year. I'm curious what your appetite would be to maybe more aggressively expand in the Fire and Safety or Fire and Security space. It's been a good vertical for you. I think it is an area or a market with a pretty considerable white space. So just curious your appetite within that vertical specifically. Todd Schneider : Yes. Stephanie, the way I would describe it is, again, we were able to invest more in M&A this year than going back all the way to fiscal '17. That being said, that is a byproduct of just timing, deal flow, when people make decisions. I wouldn't call it a change in strategy on our part. It was more about timing and flow. And that's tough to predict. As far as the First Aid and Safety Services and the Fire business, we're acquisitive in every single route-based business that we have. And so, we like to evaluate every single deal and make a good decision. In the Fire business specifically, we want to make sure that we're competitive and aggressive after good, attractive deals. The mix of business matters to us, meaning we like a business that meets the mix of test and inspect that we have and repair along with that as well. And there are some deals that have come across our desks that we have chosen not to participate in because there's a significant amount of installation in those businesses. And the installation business tends to be kind of tied to new construction. And that is really a very business and not one that's as attractive to us. It's tougher to staff, tougher -- it's kind of like bid and chase business. So, we've chosen to avoid those. But we really like both the -- all the route-based businesses. Again, we're highly acquisitive and would like to continue on that path. Operator : And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jared for closing remarks. Jared Mattingley : Thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our first quarter of fiscal '25 financial results in September. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

With me today are Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll discuss our fiscal '25 first quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I will now turn the call over to Todd. Todd Schneider : Thank you, Jared. We are pleased with our start to fiscal year 2025. Our first quarter results reflect the strength and breadth of Cintas\u2019s value proposition for businesses of all types and stellar execution by our employee partners. First quarter total revenue grew 6.8% to $2.5 billion, an all-time high for revenue in a quarter. First quarter revenue growth was negatively impacted by one last workday in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. On a same-day work basis, first quarter revenue growth was 8.4%. The organic growth rate, which adjust for the impacts of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and the fact that there was one less workday in the quarter was 8.0%. Each of Cintas\u2019s business divisions contributed to our success in the quarter. As Mike will detail, our rental division was right where we like them to be, and our first aid and safety and fire protection businesses each generated double-digit year-over-year growth, demonstrating the complementary nature of our platform and our long runway for future growth. The value of the products and services Cintas delivers continues to resonate with customers of all sizes and across industries. We remain focused on the tremendous opportunity we have to serve 16 million businesses across North America. In the first quarter, we continue to experience strong demand for our services not only from existing customers, but across our new business pipeline. Businesses across our four focused verticals of healthcare, hospitality, education, and state and local government continue to perform well. Our top line results flow through to our bottom line. Gross margin for the first quarter increased 9.7% over the prior year to a record 50.1%. Operating income of 22.4% as a percent of revenue was also an all-time record, an increase of 12.1% over the prior year. Diluted EPS, which reflects the recent 4-for-1 stock split, grew a robust 18.3% to $1.10. Our earnings growth continues to reflect our relentless focus on operational excellence in every aspect of our business, including strategic sourcing, the supply chain initiatives that drive down our material cost, route and energy optimization with SmartTruck, and leveraging our SAP system to maximize the efficiency of our facilities. Cash flow was very strong in the first quarter with free cash flow increasing 62.4% over the prior year. Our cash generation enabled us to deploy capital across each of our capital allocation priorities. We continue to focus our strategic investments in our customers and our employee partners. This strategy is reflected in our capital allocation priorities that continue to position us to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. In the first quarter, we continued to invest in our businesses through capital expenditure of $92.9 million and made acquisitions in each of our three route-based segments. Our technology investments are a significant area of re-investment. We are making great strides to implement better technology driven solutions to standardize our processes across our operations. These investments have enabled us to provide more flexibility to our customers, including increased garment sharing and achieving more nimble and efficient product sourcing. Coupled with our ongoing partnerships with Verizon, Google, and SAP, we're able to make our employee partners jobs easier and get the right products to our customers faster. We are seeing these efforts continue to improve customer experience and possibly impact our margin profile. In addition to making the investments in our business to fuel future growth, returning capital to Cintas shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase remains a key priority. Cintas increases quarterly dividend by 15.6% per share, which resulted in an aggregate quarterly cash dividend payment of $157.9 million on September 3. This marked the 41st consecutive year that we increased our dividend, meaning we have maintained this practice every year since going public. We also purchased $473.6 million worth of common stock during the quarter. Before turning the call over to Mike to provide details of our first quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for fiscal year, which reflect the momentum we carried through the first quarter and the exceptional dedication of our employee partners in helping our customers meet image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance needs. We are increasing our financial guidance range for fiscal 2025. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $10.16 billion to $10.31 billion to a range of $10.22 billion to $10.32 billion, a total growth rate of 6.5% to 7.5%. We expect our organic growth rate to be in the range of 7.0% to 8.1%. We are also raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $4.06 to $4.19 to a range of $4.17 to $4.25, a growth rate of 10.0% to 12.1%. The future of Cintas remains bright, and I look forward to the year ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike to discuss the details of our first quarter results. Mike Hansen : Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2025 first quarter revenue was $2.5 billion, compared to $2.34 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and a difference in the number of workdays was 8%. Total growth was negatively impacted by 160 basis points due to one fewer workday in the first quarter, compared to the prior year period. As a reminder, we have two fewer workdays in fiscal 2025, compared to fiscal 2024. One impacted our first quarter and the second will impact our fourth quarter. Each of our fiscal 2025 quarters has 65-days. Organic growth by business was 7% for uniform rental and facility services, 14% for first aid and safety services, 13.8% for fire protection services, and uniform direct sale was down 1.8%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal \u201825 was $1.25 billion, compared to $1.14 billion last year, an increase of 9.7%. As Todd mentioned, gross margin as a percent of revenue reached a milestone 50.1% for the first quarter of fiscal \u201925, compared to 48.7% last year, an increase of 140 basis points. Robust volume growth continues to generate strong operating leverage. Our gross margins also increased as a result of our world-class supply chain, investments we have made in technology, and continued operational efficiencies. Gross margin percentage by business was 49.3% for uniform rental and facility services, 57.7% for first aid and safety services, 50.2% for fire protection services, and 40.6% for uniform direct sale. Gross margin for the uniform rental and facility services segment increased 120 basis points from last year. We continue to generate leverage as a result of our strong revenue growth. Great performance from our supply chain is lowering our product costs. We continue to realize benefits from our technology investments and we are extracting inefficiencies from the business through our Six Sigma and engineering teams. Gross margin for the first aid and safety services segment increased 180 basis points from last year. As with our rental business, strong revenue growth continues to create leverage. Our sales mix continues to be favorable with more profitable first aid products and increases in our recurring revenue products like AEDs, eyewash stations, and water brick. Our technology investment in SmartTruck continues to provide route optimization and improved efficiencies, and we continue to see sourcing benefits from our first aid dedicated distribution center that we opened several years ago that has allowed us to lower product costs. All of these contribute to improved margins. Selling administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was 27.6%, which was a 20 basis point increase from last year. We continue to make strategic investments in technology and in our partners. First quarter operating income was $561 million, compared to $500.6 million last year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue was 22.4% in the first quarter of fiscal \u201925, compared to 21.4% in last year's first quarter, an increase of 100 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 15.8%, compared to 19.2% last year. The tax rate in both quarters were impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. Net income for the first quarter was $452 million, compared to $385.1 million last year. This year's first quarter diluted EPS of $1.10, compared to $0.93 last year, an increase of 18.3%. As Todd mentioned earlier, we generated strong cash flow. Our first quarter free cash flow increased 62.4%, this has allowed us to invest back in the business, which has resulted in first quarter capital expenditures of $92.9 million. Our investments include technology to grow the top line and expand margins, automation to improve efficiencies in our plants, and additional processing capacity where needed. We expect capital expenditures to finish between 3.5% and 4% of revenue for the year. Todd provided our annual financial guidance. Related to the guidance, please note the following : fiscal \u201825 net interest expense is expected to be approximately $101 million, compared to $95 million in fiscal \u201824, predominantly as a result of higher variable rate debt used to complete a portion of the previously mentioned share buybacks. Our fiscal \u201825 effective tax rate is expected to be 20.4%, the same compared to our fiscal \u201824. And guidance does not include any future share buybacks or significant economic disruptions or downturns. With that, I'll turn it back to Todd for some closing remarks. Todd Schneider : Thank you, Mike. Before we conclude, I'd like to take a moment to thank our employee partners for their continued efforts on behalf of Cintas and our customers in the first quarter. As I've said before, our culture is our greatest competitive advantage. Our partners fuel our success, and we believe deeply in the importance of each employee partner having ownership in the company to share collectively in that success. As Cintas shares reach record highs in the spring, our board of directors approved a 4-for-1 split of our common stock, which went into effect before the market opened on September 12. We're proud to enhance the accessibility of Cintas\u2019s shares for all of our investors especially for our employee partners, so they can continue to share in the future growth of Cintas. As we look ahead to the rest of fiscal \u201825, our outlook reflects our continued confidence in our strategy and value proposition of helping our customers achieve their image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance needs. We remain focused on delivering outstanding customer experiences and making the necessary investments in the business to sustain our growth for the remainder of fiscal \u201825 and beyond. I'll now turn the call back over to Jared. Jared Mattingley : That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, George. George Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Can you talk a little bit about the overall selling environment and whether you're seeing any changes in customer purchasing behaviors in response to the overall macro environment and evolving macro uncertainty? Todd Schneider : Good morning, George. Thanks for the question. We have not seen much change in the customer behavior. It's just 60-days ago that we reported our full fiscal year \u201824 earnings. But we haven't seen much change. We still see nice demand from our customers. We're helping them with their image, their safety, their cleanliness, and their compliance needs. And that frees them up to focus on what's most important for them, taking care of their guests, their people, their patients, whatever their constituents are. So not much change, I would say, in the sales cycle or in the demand of the customer. George Tong : Got it. That's helpful. And you continue to highlight healthcare, hospitality, education, and government as key focus verticals for the company. Can you talk a little bit more about traction you're seeing in those verticals and how growth and performance there compare versus the broader company? Todd Schneider : Yes, certainly. So those, we believe we've chosen those verticals very well. We've invested in them. We run them not like just a sales vertical, but we look at them as how do we take care of those customers holistically. And I thought I would just give an example of that, but all this starts with our culture. We have a spirit of positive discontent is what we call it at Cintas, which is meaning, we're constantly focused on improving and innovating. And we also believe that the answers are not at our desk, meaning we believe the answer is out with our customers and our employee partners. So we travel and we get out and we talk to our customers about where we can help them. And I have two examples where we're helping customers in the healthcare area that came exactly from those conversations. The first was, and we've spoken a little bit about this with garment dispensing. We're continuing to have a very good success with this technology. And our healthcare customers, what they told us was they had a problem managing their inventory, in this case of scrubs, as they didn't have accountability with the scrubs. So when you don't have accountability, there's hoarding of garments that occurs, which leads to a lack of availability, meaning the first person who gets there takes garments and then those who show up later don't get the garments. And as a result, our -- the healthcare customers, for the most part, invested in what I'll call substandard product, because they wanted, well, when they didn't have control over the inventory, they went as cheap as possible. So, and this technology addresses those issues. And today, it's being used in many clinical areas, you know, labor and delivery, emergency room, operating rooms, radiology, cath labs, ICU are some examples of where we're doing that. We found the exact same opportunity, meaning when we spoke to our customers, we asked them, what else can we help you with? And they said, we are having a heck of a problem with privacy curtains. And what they told us is it was one of their top compliance issues. And those privacy curtains, when you think about those, they're in patient rooms, recovery areas, emergency rooms, and acute care, but they're also in non-acute throughout in surgery centers and medical centers. And they have to be cleaned. They have to be cleaned on a frequent basis. And so it's a real compliance challenge for our customers. So we listened to them and we didn't just take over the problem, we studied it and came up with some great products and technology. Those products have some patents on them as well and the technology allows us to track compliance. So it makes for, in total, it makes for a safer environment, a more compliant environment, and it frees up the environmental services at those organizations, who are cleaning patient rooms and other areas where clinicians provide care. So a safer, cleaner, more compliant, and more efficient environment. So I thought that might help just to give a little bit of color around what we're doing in that particular vertical, but it really starts with our culture and we listen to our customers, where can we help, and then we dive in and we provide those solutions. George Tong : Very helpful, thank you. Todd Schneider : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please go ahead, Tim. Luke McFadden : Hi, this is Luke McFadden on for Tim Mulrooney. Thanks for taking our questions today. I might have missed it in your prepared remarks, but could you provide the breakdown in new sales between market share wins and conversion of no programmers for the quarter? Todd Schneider : Yes, good morning. We did not cite it specifically, but no change to that trend. On average, we're historically about two out of three of our new customers come from what we call the no program market. The no program market would meaning that they're not with a traditional competitor. Now that doesn't mean that they're not using products and services, meaning we might go in and they need help with, they might own a mat, they might have soaps, they might buy uniforms, but they're not with a traditional competitor. So they may be spending money on these products, but we redirect them to ourselves to help them do it better, faster, smarter, cheaper in many cases. Luke McFadden : Understood, really helpful. And then kind of just sticking on that topic with my follow-up, it sounds like that no programmer penetration continues to be an area of strength in the business. I was hoping you could offer maybe some insights into the typical profile of these recent no programmer conversions? Are the majority of these recent wins of a particular business size or concentrated in any specific in market? Or is it relatively broad-based? Todd Schneider : Well that's the beauty of our business. We service a little over a 1 million customers and there's 16 million businesses in North America, U.S. and Canada. And so the wins come from all industries, all shape sizes of businesses. And that's why we're so bullish on the future, because we see that opportunity, that white space out there, as a significant opportunity to help customers, and we're still in, obviously, the very much early innings there. Luke McFadden : Understood. Thanks so much. Todd Schneider : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, Andrew. Andrew Steinerman : Hi, this is Andrew. Could you talk about merchandise amortization in the quarter? Year-over-year, how much is merchandise amortization a headwind or tailwind? And what have you assumed for the fiscal year in terms of trends in merchandise amortization? Mike Hansen : Good morning Andrew. The material cost has been an area of strength for us in and I'll say the rental business, but also the others, but I'll stick to the rental business for a second. Material cost has been trending nicely and, you know, we work hard at that material cost. So within there, you can think about our global supply chain and finding better ways to source better cost of product. And so they've done a really great job there, despite the really good business volume growth that we've had. And the other thing that we really worked hard at, as you know, Andrew, is in our stock rooms and the sharing of garments. And so we -- the more we share in terms of our garments, the more pull percentage we get out of the stock rooms. And that means we are injecting fewer garments into service. And so the combination of those things have created some nice tailwind and you see that showing up in our gross margin. We would expect that will continue through the fiscal year. Andrew Steinerman : Thanks, Mike. Operator : And our next question comes from Jasper Bibb, Truist Securities. Please go ahead, Jasper. Jasper Bibb : Hey, good morning guys. I wanted to ask about SmartTruck and the Google partnership. I think you announced that a little over a year ago now. There's a cloud migration a few quarters ago. I'm just kind of hoping you can update us on how that's progressed and where you might be seeing some associated margin or efficiency benefits at this stage? Todd Schneider : Yes, Jasper, thank you for the question. SmartTruck is -- as a reminder, is proprietary technology that we work to develop. It's been very helpful for our business, but more specifically, it's helpful for our customers, because we're able to, instead of spending time driving, we're able to spend more time with our customers. So, and when we're there with our customers, it gives us the opportunity with eyes and ears and minds in those business to solve problems for them. Whether it's something else in their business like I mentioned with -- in healthcare with garment dispensing and scrubs and privacy curtains. So more time with the customer is really valuable for us. Separate from the fact that we like to say around here, we don't make any money when the wheels are moving. We only make money, I mean, generate revenue when the wheels stop on our trucks. So that's been valuable. Our relationship with Google has been very advantageous. And as important as our relationship with Google is Google's relationship with SAP. So having that all combined gives us insight into our business, helps us to leverage our infrastructure and leverage our employee partners to put them in the right spot, the right place, the right time. So we believe that, that is going to be beneficial into the future and we really value those relationships. Jasper Bibb : Thanks, and then maybe following up on that last point, sounds like pretty good growth in fire in the quarter. Any color on or underlying operating margin for that business was in the first quarter? And it would also be great to hear how some of the initiatives you're doing there like the SAP implementation and some of the G&A investments you've called out in the past are where those stands today? Todd Schneider : Yes, good question. So we love the fire business. It is growing really nicely. The organic opportunity is amazing. The M&A opportunity is really attractive for us. And yes we're investing in that business, we\u2019re investing in our SAP system, and we're excited about that. Excited about having all of our route-based systems on one system. We think that'll really give us some insights into our customers that we don't have today. But the opportunity out there for fire is incredible just, because it's every business, the only business we're in, that every business legally has to have it, the services around it, whether it's sprinklers, alarms, in certain cases fire extinguishers, emergency lights. So we think the runway is really attractive in that business. We like the margin profile, we know how to run the business, we know the mix of business that's attractive. And as a result, not every M&A opportunity that comes down the pike is really attractive for us, but we know how to do it, and we will be aggressive as appropriate. Mike Hansen : Maybe I'll offer two things with that as well. You heard me say in the prepared remarks, this was the second quarter in a row that gross margin in the fire business was 50%. And so that is a reflection of a lot of the things that Todd talked about in terms of really going well and running the business well. We are in the midst of that SAP implementation that we've talked about and I think back in July I mentioned that there would be a little bit of pressure on fire margins in fiscal \u201925, because of that implementation. And so you see a little bit of that coming through fire SG&A and if you look at the all other operating margin, we're down a bit from Q4 to Q1 and it's a bit of that reflection of the SAP implementation. As you've seen in our first aid and safety and rental businesses, that SAP implementation, it certainly takes some time, but there are some really nice benefits subsequent to getting that system in and running it and learning how to run it. But as we talked about, fiscal \u201825 may show a little bit of pressure in SG&A and the fire business. Certainly that is all incorporated into the guide, the overall guide that we've given. Jasper Bibb : Great. Thanks for the detail there. Operator : And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead, Manav. Ronan Kennedy : Hi, good morning. This is Ronan Kennedy on for Manav. Thank you for taking my question. The strong growth in [Technical Difficulty] margin expansion, you said it was sourcing, supply chain, tech, operating efficiencies, an element of favorable mix, I think 20 bps from energy. Can I please confirm whether there's any one-time factors in there or is it the more sustainable drivers? And do you see upside to the margin expansion opportunities? Todd Schneider : Ronan, thanks for the question. No one-timers to call out. As far as where we can go with this, you know, we're focused on extracting out inefficiencies in our business and there's more to come. So we don't like to put a ceiling on our aspirations there, but, you know, we see opportunity in our business to extract that in efficiencies and so we will continue to do that. I think from an operating margin standpoint we've talked about 25% to 35% incrementals and I think our guide reflects in that range. Ronan Kennedy : Got it, thank you. And then may I please, could I ask for your current competitive dynamics within the industry and whether recent activity within the industry changes the way we think about capital allocation? Todd Schneider : Ronan, you're speaking of M&A, is that correct? Or if you'd like to clarify. Ronan Kennedy : Yes, please. And broader [Technical Difficulty] dynamic and potential implications of potential M&A and your thought process for the allocation. Todd Schneider : Great. Great. Well, M&A is an important component of our business, has been and will be. We are -- it's worked very well for our business, for our customers, our shareholders throughout. And we certainly stay aware of what's going on in the marketplace. And we like our competitive position. We think we're in a good spot. We will continue to invest to make sure that we're appropriately positioned to compete in the marketplace moving forward. So that's where our focus is, and that's what we'll continue to do. Ronan Kennedy : Thank you, appreciate it. Operator : And our next question comes from Josh Chan from UBS. Please go ahead, Josh. Josh Chan : Hi, good morning, Todd, Mike and Jared. Thanks for taking my questions. On the rental business, could you confirm that you haven't seen much change in wearer levels? And kind of relatedly, if you were to see wearer levels start to moderate the economy. Could you talk about the Cintas playbook and that scenario and what you can do to sustain the attractive growth that you're used to seeing? Thank you. Todd Schneider : Josh, thanks for the question. I'll start, Mike, feel free to chime in. You know, we certainly love when jobs are being added. We haven't seen real change in our wearer levels. But that being said, you know, our business, we've demonstrated that we can grow our business in multiples of GDP and multiples of employment growth. So we are certainly not reliant on that. That being said, I love when jobs are being added. I think it's good for our economy, and it's good for our customers, and it's good for our business. So -- but we're not reliant on that. We've also demonstrated that we can grow our business in virtually every type of economic cycle that we've seen. So we're focused on doing just exactly that, investing for the future to position our employee partners to take incredibly good care of our customers. And we'll continue to invest in that, so that we can be positioned to be really successful for the future. Josh Chan : Great, thank you for that color. And on your guidance, was the growth in Q1 better than your internal expectation? I guess I'm asking in the context of you raising the full-year guidance expectancy at the low end. I just wanted the color on your thoughts around that? Thanks so much for your time. Mike Hansen : Sure. Well, I'll say this. The growth, we saw some nice growth in the first quarter. And generally, it lines up with where we like to be. It was at the high-end of our guide, but as we now have a quarter in the books, it\u2019s a little -- we can feel a little bit more confident to bring up the low-end of the guide. If you think about that guide range, it's a same-workday growth range of 7.3% to 8.4% for the year. And when you think about the implied guide range for the rest of the year, Q2 through Q4, we're not too far different from that. 6.9% to 8.3% on a same-workday basis. So look, this 8% growth that we saw in the first quarter, organic growth is right where we want to be and the guide I think for the rest of the year is a reflection that look we have some confidence in the way we're operating we haven't seen a lot of change in the operating environment and the growth still looks good. Josh Chan : Great, and I congratulate you on that strong quarter. Todd Schneider : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Andy Wittmann from R.W. Baird. Please go ahead, Andy. Andy Wittmann : Yes, great, thanks, And good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. You guys in the script, you talked about Six Sigma. You talked about your engineering teams, degree of automation. So I was just wondering if you could talk about the rollout of things like RFID inside your plants. I know that you've been kind of testing this for a while. And I think maybe that you're ramping this a little bit more. I thought maybe Todd, you could comment on that specifically, and kind of where you are? And if this is the direction we're heading? And how long does it take you to get to that promised land where this is the way that your business runs on a day-to-day basis? I guess maybe there would be a similar question related to the auto-sortation. I think in the past you guys have talked that you like auto sort of like half of your business roughly. I was just wondering if there's any new developments on that like cheaper technologies that make it so that you can deploy it more widely or I know that sometimes like space considerations in your plant have been a limiting factor. Any technologies that have been developed that allow you to broaden the rollout of your auto-sortation. So, just hoping you could talk about those two things in particular? Todd Schneider : Certainly. Thank you, Andy. I think, let's go back to our culture. We have this, we call it a spirit of positive discontent. So, and part of that is we are constantly innovating. It's just -- it's in our DNA. It always has been since I've joined the company, and I'm sure it always will be. So we're always trying to find ways to make it easier for our partners to, our employee partners to provide services, products and services to our customers and easier for our customers to do business with us. So RFID, you mentioned, we've been using RFID for many years in our business in certain areas of that. And we're continuing to test and innovate. And hopefully there's a future where we can have that more broadly in our business. Whether it's controlling inventory is important to us, important to our customers, so we're always innovating in that area and that will continue. Similar with auto-sortation in our facilities, in our rental facilities. So we're innovating and we see opportunities there. We have invested in some proprietary technology there that allows us to more broadly leverage that -- those technologies to extract out inefficiencies in our business. So you're right, footprint can be an issue with certain technologies with auto-sortation. And we look at that and say, well, there's got to be a better way. And we've invested and we're bullish on that moving forward. Those things all take time. We're constantly tweaking to make sure we nail it. But we'll continue in that path. Andy Wittmann : Appreciate those perspectives. I thought maybe I'd ask you about some innovation maybe that's relevant to the top-line financials of your business. You've talked so much about healthcare government education. It's been a well-trodden thing for a while now. But I know you guys are always trying to open up new end markets. And I thought maybe you could talk about some of the developing end markets that maybe you're getting more excited about. Things around residential home services, is that an opportunity for you and can you just talk about if you can play there and the size of that market in comparison to some of these other growth markets that you've talked about in the past? Todd Schneider : Thanks for the question, Andy. So that's the spirit of positive discontent flows through every area of our business and we're always looking for the next best vertical. Not prepared to speak about anything where we see an investment in a particular vertical. Home residential services is not high on our list. It's not been an area of focus. It's a very different business. Certainly, they have needs for our products and services, but that has not been an area of significant investment for us. Andy Wittmann : Thank you. Todd Schneider : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead, Shlomo. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, thank you. I want to get back to a question I think that George was touching on. I know there's broad-based growth, but were there particular types of clients or verticals that you might want to call out over here in terms of, you know, really standout growth during the quarter? Todd Schneider : Shlomo, I would say that, you know, our business in totality is functioning at a very good level. So no particular vertical to call out besides, you know, the investments we've made in healthcare hospitality, education, and state and local governments. We've been investing there and will continue to. You know, if you look at how, you know, particularly the jobs reports there, they've been good in those areas. Not shocking that healthcare with the demographics of North America that there's continued investment there. But we still see really good runway in all those businesses and we expect them to grow better than we do on average. If they weren't then why would we have a focused vertical? So yes, so nothing specific to call out besides that what I just mentioned there. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Okay thanks. And this is just a housekeeping item for Mike. Just the press release says you repurchased about 474 million in stock and I go to the cash flow statement, it looks like 615 million. Can you just talk about what the differences between what's on the cash flow statement and what's in the commentary? Mike Hansen : Yes, the commentary reflects the board approved buyback authorization. The cash flow reflects that plus the impact of stock option exercises and restricted shares. So in other words, when we have employee partners that exercise a stock option. There are some shares that are effectively withheld or purchased for taxes for the exercise, the netting of shares, et cetera. For restricted shares that vest, same thing, we are withholding shares for taxes. That's the difference. Shlomo Rosenbaum : Got it, thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra from RBC. Please go ahead Ashish. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for digging my question. I just wanted to follow-up on the margin front, really solid margin expansion in the quarter. The 38% incremental margins were above your, like, a midterm guidance of 25% to 35%, and that's despite one fewer working day headwind. So as we go through the year, obviously you've made out multiple different margin expansion drivers, but how should we think about the incremental margins for the rest of the year? Thanks. Mike Hansen : Hi, Ashish. You know, we gave the 25% to 35% range, and that's where our target is. You know, the business isn't wholly linear, and so there are some periods where we invest a little bit more there are so we'll be a little bit lower in that range and there are some quarters where we'll be higher in the range. Generally speaking as we think about this year though we've got 65 work days in each of our quarters remaining and so there's a little bit of the variability, because of workdays that's not going to be there. But I expect that we'll run within that range, some quarters at the higher end, some at the lower end. That's the way we'll go through the -- as we move into the future. Todd talked about so many initiatives and Six Sigma projects and investments and these just sort of can move us through that range, sometimes even in and out of that range. Generally speaking though, our expectation is we will be in that range and that will be the really good news is that means margin improvement for the year. Ashish Sabadra : That's great color. And maybe just a quick follow-up on M&A. Just wanted to follow-up on our earlier question on M&A. If you can talk about your M&A pipeline, and appetite for potentially a large M&A deal as well? Thanks. Todd Schneider : Well, Ashish, thanks for the question. First off, again, M&A has been an important part of our strategy. And we've shown it can work really well for our business, for our customers, shareholders, all involved. And we're open to deals of various shapes and sizes across the entire platform. If you're speaking of what has been public with Vestas being courted by an international company, that acquisition in particular would pose particular challenges, because it's been historically under-invested asset. So it would make it hard for us to generate the level of value we expect from M&A in that particular one. In M&A in general, it's again, it's important to us and we think it's really attractive. It's hard to predict when sellers are ready to transact. And it takes two to dance in those categories. So -- but we're very much in that area of the business. We're very interested in M&A on a more general basis. Ashish Sabadra : That's very helpful, color, and solid result. Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, Faiza. Faiza Alwy : Yes, hi. Good morning, I wanted to talk about this first aid business, because we're seeing organic revenue growth acceleration in that business? And I'm curious if you can talk about your drivers there? And really what your expectation is for the long-term opportunity here? I don't know if you can talk about a potential scam or how we should think about the sustainability of, you know, teams type of [Technical Difficulty] business? Todd Schneider : Faiza, thank you for your question. The first aid and safety business has been great. The buying motives resonate with our customer base. There's 16 million businesses in North America. Maybe not every single one of them is a great candidate, but a large portion are great candidates for our products and services that we provide. So, you know, to a certain degree the pandemic changed some things with regards to that business, meaning people, how they look at their health and wellness of their people and of their facilities. And we think that's been positive for our business. So providing, whether it's a first aid cabinet, AEDs for in the case of sudden cardiac arrest, our eyewash stations that are for health and wellness, and certainly our water break where it provides potable water for people that in various dimensions, that makes it accessible for them. So all those have been really attractive. So the mix of business is really good, but meaning back during the pandemic it was more probably PPE focused. So that mix of that business has changed, but the demand has been very attractive. So we've invested there, we've invested in technology, we've invested in salespeople, service partners to take great care of our customers. And I neglected to mention we have a really nice training in compliance business, which helps our customers stay in compliance with the various needs they have, whether it's forklift training, first aid, general first aid training, certainly CPR training, are all things that we think we can invest in more significantly and provide more value to the customers. Faiza Alwy : And are you finding that there's revenue synergies with the uniform business? I know that you're running the businesses separately in terms of, you know, certainly there's different trucks and things like that? But I'm curious, like, what percentage of sort of new customers that you have in this first safety business or existing, you know, uniform customers? Or is it a whole new type of customer that you're attracting? Todd Schneider : Faiza, a good question. I don't have that number specific for you, but I'll say this. We do run separate trucks to those customers. And we found that having that focus organized around that business specific has been really beneficial for us. But we share data. We share data within our customers and opportunities. And as I mentioned, we have this infrastructure of employee partners that are in those customers. And when they're visiting with those customers, they have eyes, they have ears, they have minds, and they can help provide solutions to those customers. So it's easy enough to say, hey, I noticed you might have a need for this, or they may ask us. So there's a mix. Some of it were -- the very first time we do business with a customer is through first aid. Sometimes it's through fire, sometimes it's through rental. Just the sheer scale of rental certainly makes it for a nice cross-selling opportunity, because, well we've been in that business the longest. It's our heritage business and it's our largest business. But so we really don't care where we get started with the customer, we just want to do business with them, and then we'll leverage that infrastructure, that data, to try to cross-sell as best as possible to provide additional solutions for those customers. Faiza Alwy : Great, thank you so much. Todd Schneider : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Please go ahead, Stephanie. Stephanie Moore : Hi, good morning, Thank you. I wanted to touch on maybe the competitive environment within your vendor market. If you're seeing anything in terms of stepped up competitive activity in the form of maybe aggressively going after existing customers, maybe a little bit challenging from a pricing standpoint? Any color there on the competitive activity would be great. Thanks. Todd Schneider : Good morning, Stephanie. We operate in a really competitive environment, and it's been competitive since I started with a company in 1989. And I'm sure it will be competitive for the future. So one of the differences that is how we approach the business. We look at the no program market as an incredible opportunity. We service a little over 1 million customers or 16 million businesses. The white space out there is amazing. And we see that opportunity where they can buy today and we can help them today. So growing that pie is significant. That being said, yes, it's really competitive, always has been. I wouldn't say there's a real change in competitive behavior. We're focused on trying to invest in our business to make sure we provide the best solutions for our customers and position our people best to compete in the marketplace. And it's certainly very important to us. Stephanie Moore : Great. And then just as a follow-up, you touched on this actually a couple questions ago, but clearly there's some kind of potential industry consolidation activity going on. You know, as you think about that, if you were to see your industry continue to consolidate, how do you think that would impact you? Thoughts on competitive activity in a more consolidated environment and the likes of that? Thanks. Todd Schneider : Yes, good question. So we certainly pay attention to that. We never underestimate our competition, and we deal with competitors that are very good at what they do. So industry consolidation, would that have a dynamic impact? We don't think so. But we always have our head on a swivel and we're making sure that we are focused on investing in our business to best position our people to take care of our customers and to provide the best solutions for our customers. So that's where we're spending our time investing and focusing, but we pay very close attention to the competitive landscape. Mike Hansen : Keeping in mind that we compete every day against what we might call non-traditional competitors. So those who are providing direct sale uniforms, Amazon, Walmart, we're competing against all different kinds of competition. So industry consolidation is not necessarily a bad thing for us. It will continue to be competitive. Todd Schneider : Yes, I completely agree, Mike. As I mentioned, we walk into a business. They may not be with a competitor, but in many cases, they've got the products and services or something very similar as what we can provide. They're getting it from those non-traditional sources. We think we can do it better, faster, smarter, cheaper in many cases for the prospect or the customer. And that's where we've been successful in growing our business. Stephanie Moore : And I guess just to take that one quick point, I mean, you basically said it's always been competitive. If you had a greater consolidation, do you think it would be even more, you know, with maybe another player that's new to North America, do you think they would end up being actually a more or less competitive environment? Todd Schneider : Yes, it's hard to imagine it being even more competitive. It's really competitive today. But if any international competitor were to enter, we don't see the competitive dynamic changing. And again, our focus would remain on delivering great value our customers on a daily basis. Stephanie Moore : All right. I asked too many questions thanks guys. Todd Schneider : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead Scott. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. I have two, I'll ask them both up front since we're getting late here. First one, uniform direct sales, the organic declines, they persisted for I think five quarters now. And I know this is a lumpy business and the years prior was very strong. But could you guys please elaborate on trend over the balance of the year? What we might see there to the extent you have visibility? And then the second question is free cash flow really strong in the first quarter. CapEx appears on pace. So it looks like the strength was something working capital driven. Could you discuss it? Was this a timing issue or should we anticipate a particularly strong cashier and fiscal \u201825? Thanks. Todd Schneider : Scott, thanks for the question. I'll talk a little bit about the direct sale business and Mike if you'd like to respond regarding the cash flow. Scott, you nailed it. It's a lumpy business. Rollouts of national accounts, those types of national customers are highly impactful. And you also nailed it that they had incredible growth going back a couple years. So just really more timing, lumpiness, no real change in that business. We like where we're positioned and feel like we're in a good spot for the future. Mike Hansen : Yes, regarding cash flow, you're right, Scott. Free cash flow was really strong. For us, some of that is timing. So for example, you see some real working capital change in accrued compensation related liabilities. That's a little bit more timing. From accounts payable, we got a nice benefit from accounts payable. We've been working hard in accounts payable to extend some terms, and that's paying off with a nice benefit in the cash flow. For the year, generally speaking though, we look at it to be in the typical range. So free cash flow conversion of net income in the 90% to 100% range, which is sort of typically where we have been. That's where we expect to be for the rest of the year or for the full-year in total. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks, guys. Todd Schneider : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Jason Haas from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Jason. Jason Haas : Hey, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I'm curious if you could remind us what level of price increases you're putting in this year? And then I'm curious what the reception has been like from your customers? Todd Schneider : Jason, our price adjustments are a component of our growth, certainly not where we're focused in on how we grow our business, but it is a component. And our price adjustments are way lower than they were at the peak of inflation, and they're back much closer to historical today. And how they're received, you know, those are always challenging conversations. And we try to position our people on a daily basis to provide the best service so that they can go better, but it's always challenging. And it's been challenging my entire career on price adjustments. So we try to focus our time on how to best position our people, how to train them, and how to give them the best products and services so that they can provide the most value. Jason Haas : Got it. That makes sense. Thank you. And it's a good segue to the next question. I was curious about the hiring market for your own business, and I'm curious if it's gotten any easier or harder to hire people? Todd Schneider : Yes, Jason, good question. I call it similar, right? Similar meaning it's always been a challenge to find great people. And that's what we're focused on. The hiring market, it has eased, there's no doubt, from pandemic craziness. But it is certainly easier, but never easy. So That's what we're seeing in our business. We're still investing for the future. The reason we're investing is because we see the opportunities that lie ahead. Jason Haas : Got it. That makes sense. Thank you. Todd Schneider : Thank you. Operator : And at this time, there are no further questions. I'll turn the call back over to Jared for closing remarks. Jared Mattingley : Thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. We will issue our second quarter of fiscal \u201825 financial results in December. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
